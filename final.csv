0,1,10 Cloverfield Lane,2016,/wiki/10_Cloverfield_Lane,"After breaking up with her boyfriend Ben, Michelle drives away from New Orleans. While in rural Louisiana, she hears news reports of blackouts in several major cities before she is sideswiped by a truck and knocked off the road, falling unconscious.Michelle wakes in a locked room within an underground bunker, her wounds tended to. Howard, the bunkers owner, tells her he brought her there for her protection, claiming that the air outside has been poisoned by nuclear or chemical fallout from an unknown force. Michelle is initially hostile towards Howard, but once she has calmed down, Howard takes her on a tour of the well-stocked bunker, and she meets Emmett, another survivor who found his way to it. Howard takes her to the viewport of the bunkers exit hatch, showing her two dead pigs outside as evidence of the fallout; Michelle also sees Howards truck, and recognizes it from the accident. Michelle privately relays her concerns about Howards motivations to Emmett.During their first dinner together, Michelle secretly takes Howards keys and makes her way to the hatch, but as she is about to open it, a woman, Leslie, covered in skin lesions, slams against the window demanding she be let in, then collapses. Michelle openly returns the keys and agrees that Howard was right. Howard admits to accidentally hitting her car in his panic to get to the shelter.While the trios relationship becomes more relaxed, Howard still shows intolerance towards Emmett and treats Michelle as a little girl; however, Howard opens up about his daughter who he states is ""not with us anymore"". Howard enlists Michelle to fix the air filtration unit when it fails since she is small enough to fit through the vents; while repairing it, she finds a locked skylight, with the word ""HELP"" scratched into its glass and visible to anyone outside. Further suspicious of Howard, Michelle and Emmett discover that Howards purported daughter was a young girl who had gone missing about two years earlier, and they suspect he abducted her to the bunker. They make plans to escape the bunker, creating a makeshift Hazmat suit behind Howards back. When Howard discovers tools and parts missing, he accuses the two of stealing them, threatening to immerse them in a barrel of perchloric acid. When Emmett takes sole responsibility, Howard coldly kills Emmett with a gun. In shock, Michelle is desperately making final preparations to leave, when she is surprised by Howard. She manages to escape from him with the suit. En route, she knocks over the acid barrel, which starts an electrical fire in the bunker. It later explodes, killing Howard.Michelle dons the suit and escapes the burning bunker onto Howards homestead. Seeing signs of living wildlife, she takes off the suits helmet, but then she suddenly sees a giant biomechanical alien spacecraft, drawn by the bunker fire. A quadrupedal creature drops from the craft and chases Michelle, forcing her to hide in a shed. She then races towards the farmhouse, but the craft appears and emits a green gas that forces Michelle back into the suit. Her delay allows mechanical appendages from the ship to capture her, but she is able to craft a Molotov cocktail from items in Howards truck to throw into the ship. The fireball causes the appendage to drop her, and she is able to take the dead womans car and escape.As she nears the Texas border she hears radio chatter instructing any survivors to head to Baton Rouge to evacuate, but also requesting the help of any able-bodied person in Houston. At a crossroads, she pauses a moment before driving off towards Houston. In the distance, a larger alien craft can be seen in the sky.",15000000,"[{""id"": 53, ""name"": ""Thriller""}, {""id"": 878, ""name"": ""Science Fiction""}, {""id"": 18, ""name"": ""Drama""}]",http://www.10cloverfieldlane.com/,333371,"[{""id"": 1930, ""name"": ""kidnapping""}, {""id"": 2321, ""name"": ""bunker""}, {""id"": 2340, ""name"": ""paranoia""}, {""id"": 9866, ""name"": ""basement""}, {""id"": 10833, ""name"": ""survivalist""}, {""id"": 12332, ""name"": ""apocalypse""}, {""id"": 13063, ""name"": ""car accident""}, {""id"": 15381, ""name"": ""captive""}]",en,"After a car accident, Michelle awakens to find herself in a mysterious bunker with two men named Howard and Emmett.

1,2,13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi,2016,/wiki/13_Hours:_The_Secret_Soldiers_of_Benghazi,"In 2012, Benghazi, Libya is named one of the most dangerous places in the world, and countries have pulled their diplomatic offices out of the country in fear of an attack by militants. The United States, however, still has a diplomatic compound (not an official consulate) open in the city. Less than a mile away is a CIA outpost called ""The Annex"", which is protected by a team of private military contractors from Global Response Staff (GRS). New to the detail is Jack Silva, who arrives in Benghazi and is picked up by Tyrone ""Rone"" Woods, commander of the GRS team and a personal friend of Silva. Arriving at the Annex, Silva is introduced to the rest of the GRS team and the CIA Chief of Station, who constantly gives the team strict reminders to never engage the citizens.The U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens arrives in Benghazi to maintain diplomatic connections amidst the political and social chaos. Despite warnings, Stevens decides to stay at the Special Mission with limited protection from five Diplomatic Security (DS) agents, principally, Scott Wickland and Dave Ubben, along with guards hired from the local February 17th Martyrs Brigade militia, nicknamed ""17-Feb"". On the morning of the eleventh anniversary of the September 11 attacks, Stevens notices suspicious men taking pictures of the compound and notifies his security detail. Back at the Annex, Silva finds out that his wife is pregnant.That night, a group of militants from Ansar al-Sharia assault the compound. The 17-Feb guards quickly surrender their posts, allowing the attackers easy access to the Special Mission compound. Wickland takes Stevens and Smith, an IT specialist, into the safe room. Unable to breach the safe room, the attackers set the building on fire hoping to burn the men out. Wickland is able to escape but loses both Stevens and Smith. At the Annex, the GRS team desperately wants to go to the compound to help, but the Chief refuses, fearing that the teams departure would expose the Annex. However, the team dispatches to the compound and meets up with the DS agents. Silva and Woods go into the building to try to find Stevens and Smith, but are only able to find Smiths body. The DS team from the compound retreats to the Annex; but after Wickland goes in the wrong direction, they are followed back to the Annex. Later, the GRS team also retreats to the Annex.Knowing an attack by the militants is imminent, the CIA staff of the Annex makes several desperate calls for help. The only help they can get is from Glen ""Bub"" Doherty, a GRS officer in Tripoli, who forms a team including two Delta operators that fly to Benghazi after several delays. Meanwhile, the GRS team fends off the militants as they try to breach the Annex perimeter. After repelling the largest attack wave, the Annex receives word from ISR that help is en route.The Tripoli GRS reinforcements arrive and begin preparing the CIA and DS staff to depart for the airport. The militants launch a mortar attack in which Ubben and Geist are wounded; Geists left arm is partially severed. Woods rushes to aid Geist and is killed by another mortar round. Doherty is also killed when a third mortar detonates directly in front of him.With the GRS team compromised, and the Annex now vulnerable, the remaining GRS operators watch as a convoy of vehicles rolls toward the Annex. Fearing the worst, the operators prepare to make a final stand, until it is revealed that the convoy is an element of the Libya Shield Force militia escorting the GRS reinforcements. They also find out that Stevens was found behind the compound, but was pronounced dead at the hospital.At the airport, the CIA staff and the wounded Geist board the plane to Tripoli while the remainder of the GRS team waits for the next plane with the bodies of Stevens, Smith, Woods and Doherty. Closing titles reveal that all of the surviving members of the Annex security team received contractor medals in a private ceremony and have since retired from the GRS team and live with their families (Geist was able to save his arm after several surgeries).",50000000,"[{""id"": 28, ""name"": ""Action""}, {""id"": 18, ""name"": ""Drama""}, {""id"": 36, ""name"": ""History""}, {""id"": 53, ""name"": ""Thriller""}, {""id"": 10752, ""name"": ""War""}]",http://www.thirteenhoursmovie.com/,300671,"[{""id"": 818, ""name"": ""based on novel""}, {""id"": 1376, ""name"": ""assault rifle""}, {""id"": 3070, ""name"": ""mercenary""}, {""id"": 5272, ""name"": ""libya""}, {""id"": 5565, ""name"": ""biography""}, {""id"": 9672, ""name"": ""based on true story""}, {""id"": 11115, ""name"": ""heroism""}, {""id"": 14601, ""name"": ""explosion""}, {""id"": 34061, ""name"": ""american abroad""}, {""id"": 34079, ""name"": ""death""}, {""id"": 209493, ""name"": ""21st century""}, {""id"": 214596, ""name"": ""cia agent""}, {""id"": 235476, ""name"": ""u.s. ambassador""}]",en,An American Ambassador is killed during an attack at a U.S. compound in Libya as a security team struggles to make sense out of the chaos.,42.526529,"[{""name"": ""Paramount Pictures"", ""id"": 4}, {""name"": ""3 Arts Entertainment"", ""id"": 787}, {""name"": ""Bay Films"", ""id"": 6734}, {""name"": ""Latina Pictures"", ""id"": 19108}, {""name"": ""Dune Films"", ""id"": 19477}]","[{""iso_3166_1"": ""MT"", ""name"": ""Malta""}, {""iso_3166_1"": ""MA"", ""name"": ""Morocco""}, {""iso_3166_1"": ""US"", ""name"": ""United States of America""}]",1/13/2016,69411370,144,"[{""iso_639_1"": ""ar"", ""name"": ""\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629""}, {""iso_639_1"": ""en"", ""name"": ""English""}]",Released,"When everything went wrong, six men had the courage to do what was right.",13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi,7,938,0.090840459,0.5,0.205106646,0.5,-0.294893354,0.294893354,-0.409159541,0.332982083,1.3882274
3,4,21 Jump Street,2014,/wiki/21_Jump_Street_(film),"In 2005, scholarly student Morton Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and popular underachieving jock Greg Jenko (Channing Tatum) miss their school prom; Schmidt being rejected by the girl he asked to be his date and Jenko being barred from attending because of his grades. Seven years later, the duo meets again at the Police Academy and become friends and partners on bicycle patrol. They catch a break when they arrest Domingo (DeRay Davis), the leader of a one-percenter motorcycle gang, but are forced to release him after they failed to read him his Miranda rights.The duo is reassigned to a revived scheme from the 1980s, which specializes in infiltrating high schools. Captain Dickson (Ice Cube) assigns them to contain the spread of a synthetic drug called HFS at Sagan High School. He gives them new identities and enrolls them as students, giving them class schedules fitting their previous academic performances; Jenko taking mostly arts and humanities, and Schmidt taking mostly science classes, but the duo mixes up their identities. Schmidt gets a lead on HFS from classmate Molly (Brie Larson), and he and Jenko meet the schools main dealer, popular student Eric (Dave Franco). The two take HFS in front of him to maintain their cover. After experiencing the drugs effects, the duo discovers that Schmidts intelligence now makes him popular, while Jenkos lax attitude is frowned upon.Eric takes a liking to Schmidt, who develops a romantic interest in Molly. Jenko becomes friends with the students in his AP Chemistry class and finds himself becoming more interested in geeky hobbies and academic pursuits. Schmidt and Jenko throw a party at Schmidts parents house, where they are living during the course of their assignment, and invite Eric. During the party, a fight breaks out between Schmidt, Jenko, and some party crashers. Schmidt wins the fight, solidifying his social status and gaining Erics trust. Jenkos friends hack Erics phone to enable them to listen in on his conversations.At a party at Erics house, using the phone hack, Jenko and his friends overhear information about an upcoming meeting between Eric and his supplier, but also catch Schmidt making disparaging comments about Jenko. The rift between the duo grows as their new school life intrudes upon their official police work. Schmidt and Jenko track Eric to a cash transaction with the distributors of HFS – the motorcycle gang from the park – and a chase ensues on the freeway. They return to school, argue, and eventually begin fighting, which disrupts the school play. They are expelled from school and are removed from the Jump Street program.Eric, stressed and terrified, recruits Schmidt and Jenko as security for a deal taking place at the school prom. While dressing for the prom, Schmidt and Jenko rekindle their friendship. At the prom, they discover that the supplier is the physical education teacher, Mr. Walters (Rob Riggle), who created the drug accidentally and started selling it to the students to supplement his teachers salary. Having caught Eric smoking marijuana, he was able to persuade him into being his dealer.The motorcycle gang arrives for the deal but Molly interrupts them and starts arguing with Schmidt. As a result, the gang leader recognizes Schmidt and Jenko, and orders his men to kill them. Two of the gang members reveal themselves as undercover DEA agents Tom Hanson and Doug Penhall (Johnny Depp and Peter DeLuise), and former members of the 21 Jump Street program. In the ensuing gunfight, Hanson and Penhall are fatally wounded. Mr. Walters and Eric escape with the money and Molly as a hostage; the gang, Schmidt, and Jenko follow close behind. Jenko creates a homemade bomb and uses it to kill the gang. Mr. Walters shoots at Schmidt but Jenko takes the bullet to his arm, sparing Schmidts life. In response, Schmidt shoots Mr. Walters, unintentionally severing his penis. As they arrest Mr. Walters and Eric (in addition to successfully reading the Miranda rights), Schmidt and Jenko reconcile their relationship and Schmidt and Molly share a kiss.Both officers are congratulated and reinstated in Jump Street as Dickson gives them a new assignment: infiltrating a college.",42000000,"[{""id"": 28, ""name"": ""Action""}, {""id"": 35, ""name"": ""Comedy""}, {""id"": 80, ""name"": ""Crime""}]",http://www.21jumpstreet-movie.com/,64688,"[{""id"": 3230, ""name"": ""male friendship""}, {""id"": 6270, ""name"": ""high school""}, {""id"": 9755, ""name"": ""parody""}, {""id"": 9964, ""name"": ""crude humor""}, {""id"": 10988, ""name"": ""based on tv series""}, {""id"": 11199, ""name"": ""undercover cop""}, {""id"": 167316, ""name"": ""buddy cop""}, {""id"": 167541, ""name"": ""buddy comedy""}, {""id"": 179431, ""name"": ""duringcreditsstinger""}]",en,"In high school, Schmidt was a dork and Jenko was the popular jock.

4,5,22 Jump Street,2014,/wiki/22_Jump_Street,"Two years following their success in the 21 Jump Street program, Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum) are back on the streets chasing narcotics. However, after failing in the pursuit of a group of drug dealers led by Ghost (Peter Stormare), Deputy Chief Hardy (Nick Offerman) puts the duo back on the program to work for Captain Dickson (Ice Cube) – now located across the street at 22 Jump Street. Their assignment is to go undercover as college students and locate the supplier of a drug known as ""WHY-PHY"" (Work Hard? Yes, Play Hard? Yes) that killed a student photographed buying it on campus from a dealer.At college, Jenko quickly makes friends with a pair of jocks named Zook (Wyatt Russell) and Rooster (Jimmy Tatro), they later become the prime suspects of the investigation. Jenko starts attending parties with the jocks who do not take as kindly to Schmidt. Meanwhile, Schmidt gets the attention of an art student, Maya (Amber Stevens), by feigning an interest in slam poetry. The two sleep together, to the disapproval of Mayas roommate Mercedes (Jillian Bell), and Schmidt later finds that Maya is the daughter of Captain Dickson, whom Schmidt bragged to about ""getting laid"", much to Dicksons fury. Despite sleeping together, Maya tells Schmidt not to take it seriously, and he starts to feel left out as Jenko bonds more and more with Zook who encourages him to join the football team.When Schmidt and Jenko are unable to identify the dealer, they visit Mr. Walters (Rob Riggle) and Eric (Dave Franco) in jail for advice. After confessing the two are having regular intercourse, Walters points out a unique tattoo on the arm of the dealer in the photograph. Whilst hanging out with Zook and Rooster, Jenko notices that Rooster does not have the tattoo but sees it on Zooks arm. Schmidt and Jenko are invited to join the fraternity led by the jocks, but Schmidt refuses, furthering the tension between the two as Jenko passes their requirements. They later realize that Zook is not the dealer but rather another customer. Soon afterwards, they find Ghost and his men on campus, but Ghost again evades them. Jenko reveals to Schmidt that he has been offered a football scholarship with Zook and is uncertain about his future as a police officer. Afterwards, Schmidt reveals his true identity and moves out of the dorm, angering Maya.Spring break arrives, and Schmidt goes after Ghost. He is joined by Jenko, so the two can have one final mission together. The pair head to the beach where Ghost is likely to be dealing WHY-PHY. Inside a bar, they find Mercedes, who is Ghosts daughter, giving instructions to other dealers. The pair, backed up by Dickson and the rest of Jump Street, ambush the meeting. Ghost flees, while Mercedes is knocked out by Schmidt. While pursuing Ghost, Jenko is shot in the shoulder. Ghost attempts to escape in a helicopter; Schmidt and Jenko manage to jump across to it, but they fall into the sea due to Jenkos injured arm. However, Jenko is able to throw a grenade into the helicopter. Ghost celebrates his victory prematurely while the grenade explodes, sending the totalled remains into the sea. Jenko tells Schmidt that he still wants to be a police officer as he believes their differences help their partnership, and the two reconcile in front of a cheering crowd. Dickson approaches them claiming to have a new mission undercover at a med school.During the credits, Jenko and Schmidt go on to a variety of undercover missions to different schools, which are portrayed as fictional sequels, an animated series, and a toy line.

6,7,30 Minutes or Less,2011,/wiki/30_Minutes_or_Less,"Marijuana-smoking, Grand Rapids slacker pizza delivery driver Nick (Jesse Eisenberg) has trouble completing the ""30 Minutes or Less"" policy and is reprimanded by his boss Chris (Brett Gelman). Nicks school teacher friend Chet (Aziz Ansari) discovers that Nick slept with his twin sister, Kate (Dilshad Vadsaria), on the night of their high school graduation, causing Nick and Chet to end their friendship. Dwayne Mikowlski (Danny McBride) and Travis Cord (Nick Swardson), are miserable living under the shadow of Dwaynes domineering father, The Major (Fred Ward), who about 10 years prior won over $50 million in the lottery. Dwayne confides in lap-dancer Juicy (Bianca Kajlich) about his contempt for his father and Dwaynes presumed inheritance. At Traviss suggestion, he and Dwayne devise a plot to kidnap a complete stranger and strap a remote-controlled bomb to his chest. They order a pizza and wait for a driver to come to their hideout. When Nick arrives, Dwayne and Travis assault him and knock him unconscious.When Nick wakes up, he finds a vest rigged with explosives strapped and buckled onto his torso, with both a timer and a cellular phone-activated trigger. Dwayne and Travis tell him his situation: the bomb will detonate unless he robs a bank within 10 hours. They also threaten to detonate the bomb if Nick notifies the police. He goes to Chets school job and alerts him of the situation, to which he reluctantly accepts. En route to the bank, Nick manages to quit his job and then goes to see Kate for the last time. Nick and Chet hold up the bank and obtain money while the bank manager pulls the alarm, forcing Nick and Chet to flee quickly. Dwayne says he and Travis will meet Nick at an abandoned rail yard to make the exchange. Dwayne and Travis go to a restaurant instead as Dwayne calls up Juicy to get her hit-man ally and to head to the rail yard. Juicy and the hit man Chango (Michael Peña) arrive to pick up the money. Nick hands Chango the money and expects Chango to give him the code which will deactivate the bomb. However, Chet appears and strikes Chango with a metal bar while Nick incapacitates Juicy. The two grab the money and escape.Overly frustrated by the turn of events and when Nick refuses to answer the phone again, Dwayne activates the speed dial number on his phone for the bomb to explode, but Travis alters the numbers. Rethinking their plan, he and Dwayne head to Kates apartment in their masks and kidnap her. Chango breaks into the Majors house to find information regarding Dwaynes location and finds a hand-drawn map to the scrapyard. While there, the Major attacks him with a pen gun. The Major is then shot by Chango after a struggle. Upon applying some peroxide, Chango uses the information he found in Dwaynes room to head to the scrapyard. Dwayne threatens to kill Kate unless Nick meets up with him at the scrapyard.At the scrapyard, Dwayne gives Nick the code 69 69 69 to deactivate and unbuckle the bomb with just minutes to spare. Dwayne has them at gunpoint but Nick has Chet fake having a sniper on them by pointing with his laser pointer. After believing him, Dwayne and Travis drop their weapons and leave with the money. However, Nick is knocked out by Chango who now has Dwayne at gunpoint, demanding the money. Dwayne gives him the money but Chango decides to still kill him and is torched with a flamethrower by Travis. While being burned on the ground, Chango wounds Dwayne and shoots the gas tank on Traviss back, causing it to explode. Nick takes the money and leaves with Kate and Chet. Dwayne chases after Nick and steals the money and when he has Nick at gunpoint his van explodes, seemingly killing him. Nick reveals he reactivated the bomb and put it in Dwaynes van.

7,8,300,2014,/wiki/300_(film),"In 479 BC, one year after the Battle of Thermopylae, Dilios, a hoplite in the Spartan Army, begins his story by depicting the life of Leonidas I from childhood to kingship via Spartan doctrine. Dilioss story continues and a Persian herald arrives at the gates of Sparta demanding ""earth and water"" as a token of submission to King Xerxes - the Spartans reply by throwing the envoy and his escort into a deep well. Leonidas then visits the Ephors, proposing a strategy to drive back the numerically superior Persians through the Hot Gates. His plan involves building a wall in order to funnel the Persians into a narrow pass between the rocks and the sea: negating the Persian advantage in numbers, and giving Greek heavy infantry the advantage over the vast waves of Persian light infantry. The Ephors consult the Oracle, who decrees that Sparta will not go to war during the Carneia. As Leonidas angrily departs, an agent from Xerxes appears, rewarding the Ephors for their covert support.Although the Ephors have denied him permission to mobilize Spartas army, Leonidas gathers three hundred of his best soldiers in the guise of his personal bodyguard. They are joined along the way by Arcadians. At Thermopylae, they construct the wall made up of stones and slain Persian scouts as mortar, angering a Persian emissary. Stelios, an elite Spartan soldier, orders the former to go back to the Persian lines and warn Xerxes, after cutting off his whipping arm.Meanwhile, Leonidas encounters Ephialtes, a deformed Spartan whose parents fled Sparta to spare him certain infanticide. Ephialtes asks to redeem his fathers name by joining Leonidas army, warning him of a secret path the Persians could use to outflank and surround the Spartans. Though sympathetic, Leonidas rejects him since his deformity physically prevents him from holding his shield high enough, potentially compromising the phalanx formation, and Ephialtes is enraged.The battle begins soon after the Spartans refusal to lay down their weapons. Using the Hot Gates to their advantage, as well as their superior fighting skills, the Spartans repel wave after wave of the advancing Persian army. During a lull in the battle, Xerxes personally approaches Leonidas to persuade him to surrender, offering him wealth and power in exchange for his allegiance. Leonidas declines and mocks Xerxes for the inferior quality of his fanatical warriors. In response, Xerxes sends in his elite guard, the Immortals, later that night. The Spartans nonetheless manage to defeat the Immortals with few losses, with slight help from the Arcadians.On the second day, Xerxes sends in new waves of armies from Asia and other Persian subject states, including war elephants, to crush the Spartans once and for all, but to no avail. Meanwhile, Ephialtes defects to Xerxes to whom he reveals the secret path in exchange for wealth, luxury, women, and a Persian uniform. The Arcadians retreat upon learning of Ephialtes betrayal, but the Spartans stay. Leonidas orders an injured but reluctant Dilios to return to Sparta and tell them of what has happened: a ""tale of victory"".In Sparta, Queen Gorgo tries to persuade the Spartan Council to send reinforcements to aid the 300. Theron, a corrupt politician, claims that he ""owns"" the Council and threatens the Queen, who reluctantly submits to his sexual demands in return for his help. When Theron disgraces her in front of the Council, Gorgo kills him out of rage, revealing within his robe a bag of Xerxes gold. Marking his betrayal, the Council unanimously agrees to send reinforcements. On the third day, the Persians, led by Ephialtes, traverse the secret path, encircling the Spartans. Xerxes general again demands their surrender. Leonidas seemingly kneels in submission, allowing Stelios to leap over him and kill the general. A furious Xerxes orders his troops to attack. Leonidas rises and throws his spear at Xerxes; barely missing him, the spear cuts across and wounds his face, proving the God-Kings mortality. Leonidas and the remaining Spartans fight to the last man until they finally succumb to an arrow barrage.Dilios, now back at Sparta, concludes his tale before the Council. Inspired by Leonidas sacrifice, Greece mobilizes. One year later, the Persians face an army of 30,000 free Greeks led by a vanguard of 10,000 Spartans. After one final speech commemorating the 300, Dilios, now head of the Spartan Army, leads them to war, against the Persians across the fields of Plataea.",65000000,"[{""id"": 28, ""name"": ""Action""}, {""id"": 12, ""name"": ""Adventure""}, {""id"": 10752, ""name"": ""War""}]",http://300themovie.warnerbros.com,1271,"[{""id"": 3597, ""name"": ""evisceration""}, {""id"": 5538, ""name"": ""javelin""}, {""id"": 5539, ""name"": ""shield""}, {""id"": 6092, ""name"": ""army""}, {""id"": 8637, ""name"": ""fall from height""}, {""id"": 14704, ""name"": ""ancient world""}, {""id"": 171603, ""name"": ""s.a.t.""}, {""id"": 190999, ""name"": ""minions""}]",en,"Based on Frank Miller's graphic novel, ""300"" is very loosely based the 480 B.C.

8,9,300: Rise of an Empire,2014,/wiki/300:_Rise_of_an_Empire,"Queen Gorgo of Sparta tells her men about the Battle of Marathon, in which King Darius of Persia was killed by General Themistocles of Athens ten years earlier. Dariuss son, Xerxes, witnesses his fathers death, and is advised to not continue the war, since only ""the gods can defeat the Greeks"". Dariuss naval commander, Artemisia, claims that Darius last words were in fact a challenge and sends Xerxes on a journey through the desert. Xerxes finally reaches a cave and bathes in an otherworldly liquid, emerging as the 8-foot tall ""God-King"". He returns to Persia and declares war on Greece to avenge his father.As Xerxess forces advance towards Thermopylae, Themistocles meets with the council and convinces them to provide him with a fleet to engage the Persians at the sea. Themistocles then travels to Sparta to ask King Leonidas for help, but is informed by Dilios that Leonidas is consulting the Oracle, and Gorgo is reluctant to side with Athens. Themistocles later reunites with his old friend Scyllas, who infiltrated the Persian troops and learned Artemisia was born Greek, but defected to Persia as her family was raped and murdered by Greek hoplites and she was taken as a sex slave, and subsequently left for dead in the streets. She was rescued and adopted by a Persian emissary. Her lust for vengeance gained the attention of King Darius and he made her a naval commander after she killed many of his enemies. Themistocles also learns that Leonidas has marched to fight the Persians with only 300 men.Themistocles leads his fleet of fifty warships and several thousand men, which include Scyllas, Scyllass son Calisto and Themistocles right-hand man Aeskylos to the Aegean Sea, starting the Battle of Artemisium. They ram their ships into the Persian ships, charge them, slaughtering several soldiers before retreating from the sinking Persian ships. The following day, the Greeks feign a retreat and lead a group of Persian ships into a crevice, where they become stuck. The Greeks charge the Persian ships from the cliffs above and kill more Persians. Impressed with Themistocles skills, Artemisia brings him onto her ship where she seduces him, in an attempt to lure him to the Persian side as her second-in-command. He refuses, causing her to push him aside in the middle of sex and swear revenge on him.The Persians spill tar into the sea and send suicide bombers to swim to and board the Greek ships with their flame bombs. Artemisia and her men fire flaming arrows and torches to ignite the tar, but an Athenian manages to kill one of the Persians, who falls into the tar carrying a torch, causing ships from both sides to explode. Themistocles is thrown into the sea by an explosion and nearly drowns before being rescued by Aeskylos, and stands by Scyllass side as he succumbs to his injuries. Believing Themistocles to be dead, Artemisia and her forces withdraw. After recovering from his injuries, Themistocles learns that only a few hundred of his warriors and six of his ships survived the disastrous attack executed by Artemisia.Daxos, an Arcadian general, tells Themistocles that Leonidas and his 300 men were killed after Ephialtes betrayed the Greeks to Xerxes. Themistocles returns to Athens and confronts Ephialtes. The deformed Spartan traitor reveals that Xerxes plans to attack and burn Athens to the ground. Ephialtes is regretful of his actions, and welcomes death. Themistocles spares him instead, so he can warn Xerxes that the Greek forces are gathering at Salamis. He then visits Gorgo in Sparta while she is mourning Leonidass death to ask for help, but she is angry for what the goal of a united Greece has cost her and her people. Before departing, Themistocles returns Leonidass sword, which had been delivered to him by Ephialtes under Xerxess orders, and urges Gorgo to avenge Leonidas.In Athens, Xerxess army is laying waste when Ephialtes arrives to deliver Themistocles message. Upon learning he is alive, Artemisia leaves to ready her entire navy for battle. Xerxes suggests it is most likely a trap, but she still leaves after reminding him that she made him king through her efforts while he sat safely at a distance and watched. The remaining Greek ships charge into the Persians ships, and the two armies battle, beginning the decisive Battle of Salamis. Themistocles and Artemisia engage in a duel, which ends in a stalemate with both receiving severe injuries.At this moment Gorgo, who had been narrating the tale to the Spartans, arrives at the battle along with ships from numerous Greek city states including Delphi, Thebes, Olympia, Arcadia, and Sparta, all of them uniting against the surrounded Persians. Daxos leads the Arcadian army while Themistocles urges Artemisia to surrender. Xerxes, watching the battle from a cliff, turns his back on her, acknowledging his naval defeat and continuing the march of his army. Artemisia tries to kill Themistocles one last time but is killed as he stabs her through the stomach. While Dilios leads the Greek assault, Themistocles and Gorgo take a moment to silently acknowledge one anothers alliance as the remaining Persians attempt a counter-attack. The three then charge at the opposing Persians with the whole Greek army.",110000000,"[{""id"": 28, ""name"": ""Action""}, {""id"": 10752, ""name"": ""War""}]",http://www.300themovie.com/,53182,"[{""id"": 18712, ""name"": ""based on graphic novel""}, {""id"": 162861, ""name"": ""ancient greece""}, {""id"": 179431, ""name"": ""duringcreditsstinger""}, {""id"": 182677, ""name"": ""sea battle""}, {""id"": 188955, ""name"": ""hand to hand combat""}, {""id"": 190999, ""name"": ""minions""}, {""id"": 195862, ""name"": ""naval warfare""}, {""id"": 209714, ""name"": ""3d""}]",en,"Based on Frank Miller's latest graphic novel Xerxes and told in the breathtaking visual style of the blockbuster ""300,"" this new chapter of the epic saga takes the action to a fresh battlefield--on the sea--as Greek general Themistokles attempts to unite all of Greece by leading the charge that will change the course of the war.

15,16,A Good Day to Die Hard,2013,/wiki/A_Good_Day_to_Die_Hard,"In Moscow, Viktor Chagarin, a high-ranking, but corrupt, Russian official plans to incriminate former billionaire and government whistleblower Yuri Komarov in an imminent rigged trial unless Komarov hands over a secret file believed to contain evidence incriminating Chagarin. Separately, Jack McClane, who has been arrested after an assassination attempt, negotiates for a shorter sentence by offering to testify against Komarov. Meanwhile, Jacks father, NYPD Detective John McClane, who has not been in touch with his son for several years, has learned his son is in trouble and, taken to the airport by his daughter Lucy McClane, flies to Russia to help. As John arrives and approaches the courthouse where Komarov is on trial, a bomb explosion, orchestrated by Chagarins henchman Alik, occurs in the courthouse and Jack breaks free with Komarov. Seeing his son, John confronts him, but their dispute is cut short as Alik and his men chase them in a US Cougar MRAP through the streets of Moscow. John, Jack, and Komarov manage to escape.Hiding in a safe house, John finds out that his son is a CIA officer and has been on an undercover operation for the past three years. Jacks partner, Collins, demands the files location from Komarov so that the CIA can bring Chagarin down. Komarov eventually agrees on condition that he and his daughter are given safe passage out of Russia. Collins is eventually shot and killed while the McClanes and Komarov come under heavy gunfire from Chagarins men, but they escape. They make their way to a hotel in the city to fetch the key to the vault containing the file. There they meet up with Komarovs daughter, Irina, as earlier planned. John grows suspicious of her shifty behavior, and is proven correct when Alik and his men burst in and tie John and Jack up, while Komarov is taken as a hostage, and Irina confesses to informing on them for the ""millions of dollars"" to be gained. Jack breaks free of his ties and kills the nearest guards using a Russian gun-knife, allowing the two to kill most of the men. Alik and Irina, with Komarov still their hostage, return in a Mil Mi-24 helicopter and try to kill them, but the two escape a second time.That night, the two steal a car full of firearms and drive to Pripyat, Ukraine, where the vault with the file is located. However, Komarov, Irina, and Alik have preceded them. In a twist, the file is revealed never to have existed: the drawer with the file supposedly inside is, in fact, a secret passage to a Chernobyl vault containing €1 billion worth of weapons-grade uranium. Once inside the vault, Komarov kills Alik and calls Chagarin to gloat and to listen as Chagarin is killed by a henchman of Komarovs.At this point, John and Jack enter the vault, discover Komarovs true plot, and capture him. Irina, with another henchman, comes to her fathers aid. As they attempt to escape, Jack follows Komarov, while John goes after Irina, who is escaping on a Mil Mi-26 helicopter. Irina tries to protect her father by firing the helicopters guns at Jack. John is able to bring the helicopter out of balance by driving a truck out of the hangar section, still shackled by a chain, via the open rear ramp; he is later thrown off into the building. Komarov remarks that Jack will get to watch his father die, prompting Jack to hurl him off the rooftop into the path of the spinning helicopter rotors, killing him. As Jack and John reunite inside the building, Irina tries to avenge her father by ramming the helicopter, now out of ammunition, into the building in a suicide attack. Father and son survive by leaping off the building into a large pool of water, as the helicopter crashes and explodes, killing Irina.

On the first night, Malcolm is constantly awoken with Kisha farting loudly that eventually drives him out of the room. The next morning, when Kisha notices her keys on the floor, she tells Malcolm  they might have a ghost. To prove to her wrong, Malcolm invites over camera men Dan the Security Man and his brother Bobby. Malcolm tries to have sex with the camera on, but Kisha tells him to turn it off. Before they really start, Malcolm turns the camera back on and records everything. In the morning, Malcolm and Kisha watch the video and notice the door moved.

Since he cant sell his house in the current market, they hire Chip, a psychic, to investigate; Chip immediately falls in love with Malcolm. Before Chip can leave, after finding nothing wrong, Kisha confesses to making a deal with the devil for a pair of shoes. Chip tells Kisha she is screwed and invites Malcolm to a wrestling match.

Madea gets fed up with the customers and starts speaking rudely, causing herself to get fired on her first day. She then asks for her paycheck, but her boss tells her they will mail it. Infuriated, Madea steals a dress and some money from the cash register, then leaves.Meanwhile, Eileens daughter, Lacey Williams (Tika Sumpter), who is working as a teacher at a small school in Alabama and married to a white man named Connor (Eric Lively), has many problems on her hands: the school does not have enough money to fund its annual Christmas Jubilee. This angers the townsfolk, thus pressuring Lacey to have her ex-boyfriend, Oliver (JR Lemon), fund the school through his business. Lacey also wants one of her students, Bailey McCoy (Noah Urrea) to sing in the Christmas Jubilee. Stuck with many issues to deal with, she tells her mother that she will not be able to come home for Christmas. Eileen, determined to see her daughter for Christmas, decides to pay Lacey a surprise visit. She brings Madea, who is hesitant at first, with her, and has Oliver, who is on his way with a contract for the sponsorship, as their ride, as Eileen feels that Lacey and Oliver could still be a couple. The trio then head to Alabama, where Lacey lives. Following a short run-in with the Ku Klux Klan, the trio eventually make it to Alabama. This makes things awkward, since Lacey was not expecting her mother to come see her, and Eileen has never wanted Lacey to marry a white man. Lacey has made her mother believe that Connor is the ""farm help"" at her house.Laceys student Bailey is the son of Tanner McCoy, who Connor has had issues with since childhood. Connor is threatened by Tanner not to plant corn, which he wants to do, saying he will beat him up, as he did frequently when they were children, if he is not coerced.Lacey goes to the meeting with the school principal, Oliver, and the town mayor to go over the contract for Olivers representatives sponsorship of the jubilee. While she is out, Madea looks after Laceys class. Bailey walks into the class late and begins to get bullied by the girls of his class. Madea tells the meanest of them to leave Bailey alone and that they need to learn to be nicer to people. When Madea turns around to write her name on the chalkboard, one of the students steals her purse. Madea tells the students a modern day version of the story of the first Christmas, in order to keep the class busy. When Madea realizes that her purse is missing, she tries to then tell the children the story of Easter, but then loses her temper half way through the story and demands that somebody find her purse. Meanwhile, with the contract glazed over and signed, the town and school now have the money they need. Lacey then prepares to return to her class, but is interrupted by Oliver, who gives her a kiss. While she tries to tell Oliver that she is married and is not interested in getting back together with him, her and the principal discover that Madea has tied the girl that stole her purse to the cross decoration in the classroom.Connors parents, Buddy (Larry the Cable Guy), and Kim (Kathy Najimy), arrive at Connor and Laceys house, as they have come to visit him for Christmas and are told that they must not mention that he and Lacey are married, as they do not know that Eileen has never wanted Lacey to marry a white man. Meanwhile, Eileen decides to get a Christmas tree and cuts down one with a yellow ribbon wrapped around it in the backyard, not knowing that Kim planted the tree in memory of her deceased father. When Eileen learns of this, she expresses no remorse, upsetting Kim. That night, Eileen walks in on Buddy and Kim, seeing Buddy with a sheet over his head, convincing her that Buddy is in the KKK. Now scared, she bars the door to the room that she and Madea are sharing.The next day, while helping Connor with the farm animals, Madea reveals to Connor and Buddy that she knows Connor and Lacey are together (but not that they are married). When Connor informs Madea of this, also stating that Lacey is planning to tell Eileen about their marriage on Christmas day, Madea warns that Eileen will become upset.While at the school that same day, it is discovered by the mayor and several towns people - including Tanner McCoy - that Olivers representatives require that if they are going to sponsor the jubilee, it must be a holiday jubilee. This means that there may not be any references to Jesus, God, or the Bible.The company that is sponsoring the event is Sheldon Construction Company, which caused the jobs of many of the citizens in the town to shut down. Angered at these facts, Tanner and the other citizens convince the mayor to fire Lacey. This upsets Bailey, and he complains to his father, who does not take what his son (or his wife) says into consideration.Later that day, Buddy and Kim learn of Eileens beliefs and become offended. Kim threatens Eileen, causing Eileen to try and kick Connors parents out of the house. Madea forces Lacey to confess the truth to her mother and reveals that Eileen despises white people because her husband left her for a white woman when Lacey was 2 years old; she has lied about the story and said that a white man killed her husband. She also reveals that what Eileen said was a heart attack was in fact just gas, and that Eileen has been using this lie to manipulate her daughter. Hypocritically angered by the lies she has heard, Eileen packs her bags and sits outside of the house, hoping for a taxi to come by and pick her up. Buddy, Kim, and Madea try to convince her to come back into the house, but to no avail. The three give up on Eileen, resulting in her deciding to walk into town and take a bus back to Atlanta.Connor walks into him and Laceys bedroom and finds Lacey sitting on the bed, thinking about all that has happened to her that day. Lacey reveals that Tanner caused her to lose her job, setting Connor off. He storms out of the house in a fit of rage, gets into his truck and heads off to Tanners house, Buddy riding along. While walking to town, Eileen discovers Tanner in his truck, which has been crashed and knocked upside down. Eileen helps Tanner out of the truck before it explodes. Connor and Buddy drive up to this. Connor punches Tanner in the face and demands that Eileen get into his truck. He tells Tanner to stay away from him and Lacey and says that he is planting the corn that Tanner told him not to plant. Connor, Buddy and Eileen then drive away, while Tanner, now with a change of heart, walks back to his house.Back at Connor and Laceys house, Eileen finally accepts Connor and Laceys marriage. However, not everything has yet been settled, as Tanner and his wife pull up to the house. Connor at first demands that they leave his property, but Tanner apologizes for the things he has done and thanks Eileen for saving him. After the reconciliation, Connor asks Tanner if he wants to help him with the corn, to which Tanner gratefully says yes.At the Christmas Jubilee, Lacey thanks the Sheldon Construction Company for helping to sponsor the event (while at the same time announcing promises to help the town that were not in the original agreement, knowing that the company would have no choice but to oblige considering the repercussions if they were to back out). Bailey sings ""Mary, Did You Know"", with his parents cheering him on. Lacey also reveals to Oliver that she is married to Connor as the jubilee commences.",76135364.24,"[{""id"": 35, ""name"": ""Comedy""}, {""id"": 18, ""name"": ""Drama""}]",http://www.amadeachristmasmovie.com,175555,"[{""id"": 207317, ""name"": ""christmas""}]",en,Madea dispenses her unique form of holiday spirit on rural town when she's coaxed into helping a friend pay her daughter a surprise visit in the country for Christmas.,5.377155,"[{""name"": ""Lions Gate"", ""id"": 6644}]","[{""iso_3166_1"": ""US"", ""name"": ""United States of America""}]",12/13/2013,0,100,"[{""iso_639_1"": ""en"", ""name"": ""English""}]",Released,This Little Fool Thinks She's Getting A Damn Pony,A Madea Christmas,7,35,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0,0,0,0,0
22,23,A Thousand Words,2012,/wiki/A_Thousand_Words_(film),"Jack McCall (Eddie Murphy) is a literary agent who uses his ""gift of gab"" to get various book deals, and he is not afraid to stretch the truth to get them. While he is trying to get a book deal from a New Age self-help guru named Dr. Sinja (Cliff Curtis), the guru sees through his deceit and agrees to the deal, only to later deliver a five-page book. That night, a Bodhi Tree magically appears in his backyard. Dr. Sinja goes to Jacks house and they both discover that for every word that Jack says, a leaf will fall off of the tree. When the tree runs out of leaves, the tree will perish, as will Jack. In time, he finds that even written words count towards his limit; plus anything that happens to the tree will also affect Jack. When Jack tries to cut it down with an axe, an axe wound appears on him. When squirrels climb the tree, it tickles him. When a gardener tries to poison it with DDT, Jack gets high on the fumes and when the gardener tries to water the tree, Jack starts to sweat/perspire profusely.With Jack forced to pick and choose his words, communicating with others becomes difficult and full of misunderstandings. These misunderstandings cost him two book deals, his job, and his wife Caroline (Kerry Washington). She walks out on him when she thinks his sudden silence is due to his not loving her anymore. When he tries to explain the tree to her, she doesnt believe him. Only Jacks assistant Aaron (Clark Duke) realizes he is telling the truth, and goes to Jacks house to keep track of how many leaves remain. Jack tries to break the curse by being a better person by giving food to the homeless, and donating some of his money to charity, but that plan fails. Jack drinks a lot of alcohol in the night, causing him to sing a lot, thus making the tree lose lots of leaves. Only when Aaron confronts him and tackles him to the ground does Jack stop speaking.With his life falling apart and the tree running out of leaves, Jack confronts Dr. Sinja and asks how to end the curse. The guru tells him to make peace in all of his relationships. With just one branch of leaves left, Jack tries to reconcile with his wife, but she remains hesitant. He visits his mother Annie (Ruby Dee), who lives in an assisted-living center and has dementia. Annie tells Jack, who she thinks is Jacks late father Raymond, that she wishes Jack would stop being angry at his father for walking out on them when he was a kid. Jack, realizing that this is the relationship that needs the most mending, goes to visit his fathers grave. Jack expends the last three leaves of the tree with the words, ""I forgive you."" With no leaves remaining, Jack suffers a heart attack in a storm and appears to die.  Aaron then calls Jack on his cell phone.  Jack, who is still alive, answers his phone. Aaron tells him that the trees leaves have magically reappeared and Jack can now talk freely again.Jack and Caroline get back together, with Jack buying the family-friendly house Caroline asked for earlier, and the tree is in their front yard. He does not get his job back (Aaron was promoted to Jacks old position), but he writes a book about his experience, called A Thousand Words, and gets Aaron to make the deal. Unfortunately for Aaron, his promotion causes him to be like Jack was, thus he gets his own smaller office Bodhi tree.",40000000,"[{""id"": 18, ""name"": ""Drama""}, {""id"": 35, ""name"": ""Comedy""}]",http://www.thousandwordsmovie.com/,72358,"[{""id"": 9468, ""name"": ""liar""}, {""id"": 11204, ""name"": ""literary agent""}]",en,"Jack McCall is a fast-talking literary agent, who can close any deal, any time, any way.

He approaches Mara and she confirms the truth.Two men claiming to be from the Department of Juvenile Justice arrive at Nathans home while Mara is on her way to get Kevin. Mara is suspicious and attacks the two, but is shot and killed by the intruders. Kevin is also killed, but not before yelling for Nathan to run. Nathan runs but returns for Karen, who is captured.

His call is intercepted by CIA operative Frank Burton (Alfred Molina), who tells Nathan he is in danger and he will send two men to collect him. Dr. Bennett helps him and Karen escape. It is explained to the audience by Burton that Nathans biological father, Martin (Dermot Mulroney), stole an encrypted list of 25 corrupt CIA operatives from the Serbian terrorist Nikola Kozlow (Michael Nyqvist) when Nathan was 3: Kozlow then planned on abducting Nathan to coerce Martin to hand over the list. Nathan had been given to his adoptive parents to protect him. Kozlow used the website to claim Nathan as the missing child Steven Price in order to find him. Dr. Bennett gives Nathan the address of a safe house in Arlington, Virginia and tells him to trust only Martin and a man named Paul Rasmus. Burton is warned by his superior to end the situation as soon as possible once he learns of Bennett, who is revealed to be a former CIA operative.Arriving at the safehouse: the two obtain money, a gun, a photo of Nathans biological mother Lorna Price (Elisabeth Röhm), and a cell phone. Karen tries to call her family, but her call is intercepted by Burton and the CIA, as well as Kozlow, forcing them to flee. Finding the address for his mother, the pair discover the address is a cemetery and Lorna has died. Nathan and Karen find fresh flowers at her grave: the sender is Paul Rasmus, who lives in Nebraska. The two take an Amtrak passenger train to get there, using fake IDs provided by their friend Gilly (Denzel Whitaker). En route they confess their feelings and share a kiss. They are unaware that they are being followed by Kozlows right-hand man, who abducts Karen. He leaves her bound and gagged with duct tape, but she frees herself. Nathan fights the right-hand man and throws him out the window. Burtons team finds Kozlows henchman and tracks them down.Burton explains the data that Martin had stolen to Nathan, who considers that it may contain Burtons name on the list. The agents are attacked by Kozlows snipers. Nathan and Karen flee in a car but Kozlow calls and threatens to kill Karens parents if Nathan does not hand over the data. Nathan gets Kozlow to agree to make the transaction at a Pittsburgh Pirates baseball game at their home stadium, the PNC Park.Nathan works with Gilly to obtain tickets and secures a gun with the intent to kill Kozlow. When Kozlow arrives, he tells Nathan how he killed his mother when Nathan was 3 after she refused to give up Martins location. Kozlow grabs the gun from Nathan and demands the list, Nathan bolts and Kozlow gives chase, followed by CIA operatives. Nathan is called by Martin, who tells him to trust him and run to the south parking lot. Nathan does so and Kozlow is shot and killed by Martin. Burton and his agents arrive, and Burton asks for the cell phone. However, Martin had warned his superior about Burtons corruption and takes the phone himself while Burton is taken into custody. Martin calls Nathan again, apologizing for not being the father he should have been. Nathan asks him to show himself but Martin refuses.

28,29,Act of Valor,2012,/wiki/Act_of_Valor,"In the Philippines, a terrorist kills the U.S. ambassador, his son, and dozens of children at an elementary school, using a vehicle-borne IED disguised as an ice cream truck. The mastermind, a Chechen terrorist named Abu Shabal (Jason Cottle), escapes to a training camp in Indonesia. Elsewhere in Costa Rica, two CIA operatives, Walter Ross (Nestor Serrano) and Lisa Morales (Roselyn Sánchez) meet to consolidate intelligence about their target, a drug smuggler named Mikhail ""Christo"" Troykovich. Christos men kill Ross and capture Morales, who is imprisoned in a jungle compound and tortured.At Coronado, the members of Bandito Platoon, SEAL Team 7 are at home. Lieutenant Rorke (Rorke Denver) confides to Chief Dave that his wife is pregnant and has the entire team spend time together with their families until their next deployment. A squad from the platoon consisting of Rorke, Dave, Wiemy, Mikey, Ray, Sonny, and Ajay, is then deployed to Costa Rica to exfiltrate Morales.The seven Navy SEALs insert into the jungle via HALO and hold position outside the compound all night. At dawn, they approach the compound, hear Morales being tortured, and decide to enter the compound early. Rorke and Weimy, the team sniper, provide cover for the other five, led by Dave, who conduct room-clearing, engaging several enemy guards.  Mikey is shot in the head, blinding him in one eye, and knocking him unconscious, though he survives. The SEALs extract Morales, escaping with her and recovering a cellphone full of the information she had gathered. However, the gunfight alerts the enemy quick reaction force down the road, who drive toward the camp. The SEALs commandeer an enemy truck and exfiltrate. The hot pursuit forces them to revert to a tertiary extraction point where the Special Boat Team of SOC-R boats extract the team and neutralize the enemy pursuit with miniguns.Christo and Shabal, who are revealed to have been childhood friends, meet in Kiev. Christo knows the CIA is watching him and informs Shabal that subordinates will complete their project, which is to equip suicide bombers with specialized vests.On the amphibious assault ship USS Bonhomme Richard, Rorke is informed that the intelligence recovered confirms Shabal and Christo were working together. Shabal, an old-school Muslim terrorist, seeks to bring jihad to the U.S., while Christo provides the routes for smuggling drugs and people into the U.S. Ajay and Ray are sent to Somalia, where an arms transfer involving Shabal is taking place. The remaining SEALs, comprising Rorke, Dave, Sonny and Weimy, stay in the U.S. in case the terrorists make it in. Miller himself has been reassigned to SEAL Team Four, hunting for Christo somewhere on the oceans. Lieutenant Rorke gives Dave a letter to give to his family in case he is killed.Shabal and sixteen terrorists are found to be on an island off Baja California, where the SEALs act to secure the island, killing eight terrorists. Shabal and eight others escape. Elsewhere, in the South Pacific, SEAL Team Four captures Christo and interrogate him. Christo and Shabal are found to be associates and that there is a plan to detonate vest bombs throughout the U.S., in order to cause panic and economic disruption with the goal to surpass that of the September 11 attacks.The SEALs are informed that Shabal is en route to the U.S. via tunnels underneath a milk factory, and are ordered to link up with Mexican Special Forces and neutralize the remaining targets. Arriving at the factory, the SEALs and Mexican forces launch an assault there. During the gunfight, a combatant throws a grenade, and Rorke dives on it to save his team before it detonates, killing him. Dave pursues the terrorists and shoots them as they try to escape through the tunnels. He is then shot several times and gravely wounded by Shabal, who is intercepted and killed by Sonny before he could execute Dave.At home, Rorke is given a military funeral with full honors, where the SEALs pay their respects. It is then revealed that Daves narration throughout the movie was a written letter meant for Rorkes son.

He is left out by his family; his older brother, Anthony (Dylan Minnette), his older sister, Emily (Kerris Dorsey), his mother, Kelly (Jennifer Garner), his father, Ben (Steve Carell), and his baby brother, Trevor (Elise/Zoey Vargas), living in the Los Angeles metropolitan area of California.Anthony is trying to earn his drivers license so he can drive his bitter girlfriend, Celia, to the prom; Emily is rehearsing for the title role in her school play; Kelly is working for a publication company that is publishing a new childrens book which will promote her to vice president of the company; and Ben, who has been unemployed for seven months, has landed a job interview as a game designer for a video game company.That same morning, Alexander attends school where he experiences another series of mishaps, such as accidentally setting fire to his crush, Becky Gibsons, notebook as well as finding out that his friends, including Becky, and even his best friend, Paul, will all be attending the birthday party of Philip Parker (Lincoln Melcher) instead of his, due to Philips expensive party entertainment and popularity. That night, Alexander puts a candle on a sundae and wishes that everyone in his family would experience what he is going through.The next morning, Alexander wakes up to find his family in disarray and chaos erupts; his parents have overslept, Emily has a cold, and Anthony has found out that he and Celia broke up. The battery in Kellys car is dead, and Ben has to take Trevor with him to the interview after dropping Kelly off at work. At school, Paul gives Alexander good news: Philips birthday party is canceled (as Philip has the chicken pox), so the kids (including Becky and Paul) that were originally going to attend Philips party will attend Alexanders party instead, much to Alexanders delight. Alexander calls his father, asking him to plan a party for him. Kelly is informed of an embarrassing typo in the book they are publicizing (""dump"" instead of ""jump"") and needs to stop Dick Van Dyke from reading it at a public reading later. Ben takes Trevor along to the office interview and meets Greg (Donald Glover) who seems impressed at his credentials, although they decide to hold another meeting after Trevor ingests a non-toxic highlighter. Meanwhile, at school, Anthony finds out that Celia has gotten back together with him. Feeling excited about what happened, Anthony jumps up and hits a banner, not knowing that its connected to two trophy cases, which fall and smash. Because of this, Anthony is suspended from school.Kelly manages to arrive at Dick Van Dykes reading, but she is too late in trying to warn him about the books typo. He reads it with the inappropriate material, humiliating himself, scaring the kids and almost getting Kelly arrested. Meanwhile, Ben purchases cough syrup for Emilys symptoms and takes Anthony to the Department of Motor Vehicles, where his driving examiner intentionally distracts him by convincing him to pick up his cell phone, causing him to destroy several parking meters and damage the family minivan, and ultimately fail his driving exam. They all go to Emilys play, which is inadvertently sabotaged by her impaired behavior because of her getting excessively drunk after overdosing on the cough syrup. Afterwards, the game design firm calls Ben and asks him to meet them at Nagamaki, a Japanese hibachi restaurant, for another meeting. The family, joined by Celia, goes to the restaurant in their badly damaged minivan, where Ben accidentally sets his shirt on fire at the grill, embarrassing him to the employers. The whole family consoles him, admitting that they will overcome whatever else the day has in store for them. Alexander states, ""You just gotta have the bad days so you can love the good days even more"", and Anthony suddenly decides not to go to the prom with Celia, stating that his family is more important, and they break up completely.The family returns home and discovers that Ben had hired a rental animal service to recreate an Australian petting zoo for Alexanders birthday party. A crocodile and kangaroo, however, have escaped from their cage. They then decide to pitch in to try and salvage the day by helping host it.

35,36,Alice in Wonderland,2010,/wiki/Alice_in_Wonderland_(2010_film),"Troubled by a strange recurring dream and mourning the loss of her father, 19-year-old Alice Kingsleigh attends a garden party at Lord Ascots estate. There, she is confronted by an unwanted marriage proposal to Lord Ascots son, Hamish, and the stifling expectations of the society in which she lives. Unsure of how to proceed, she pursues a rabbit wearing a blue waistcoat and accidentally falls into a large rabbit hole under a tree. She emerges in a forest where she is greeted by the White Rabbit, the Dormouse, the Dodo, the Talking Flowers, and Tweedledum and Tweedledee. They argue over whether Alice is ""the right Alice"" who must slay the Red Queens Jabberwocky and restore the White Queen to power, as foretold by Absolem the Caterpillar and his prophetic scroll. The group is then ambushed by the Bandersnatch and a group of playing-card soldiers led by the Knave of Hearts. Alice, Tweedledum and Tweedledee escape into the woods. The Knave steals the Caterpillars scroll. The Dormouse leaves the others behind with one of the Bandersnatchs eyes in her possession. Tweedledum and Tweedledee are then captured by the Red Queens Jubjub bird.The Knave informs the Red Queen that Alice threatens her reign, and the soldiers and Bayard the Bloodhound are ordered to find Alice immediately. Meanwhile, the Cheshire Cat guides Alice to the March Hare and the Mad Hatter. The Hatter helps Alice avoid capture by allowing himself to be seized instead. Later, Alice is found by the Bloodhound, but Alice insists upon helping the Hatter. At the Red Queens citadel and palace, the Red Queen is unaware of Alices true identity and therefore welcomes her as a guest. Alice learns that the vorpal sword, the only weapon capable of killing the Jabberwocky, is locked inside the den of the Bandersnatch. The Knave attempts to seduce Alice, but she rebuffs him, causing a jealous Red Queen to order that Alice be beheaded. Alice obtains the sword and befriends the Bandersnatch by returning its eye. She then escapes on the back of the grateful Bandersnatch and delivers the sword to the White Queen. The Cheshire Cat saves the Hatter from the executioner, and the Hatter calls for rebellion against the Red Queen. The rebellion is quickly put down by the Jubjub bird, but the resistance flees to the White Queens castle, and both armies prepare for battle.

39,40,Allegiant,2016,/wiki/Allegiant_(novel),"Following the revelation of the truth about their city, Evelyn Johnson-Eaton becomes the leader of the city and forces all faction members to live equally with the factionless. Through confessing her role in the previous insurgency, Beatrice ""Tris"" Prior, Christina, and Cara are pardoned. Tris is informed by Tobias ""Four"" Eaton that the faction members have formed the ""Allegiant"", a rebel group wanting to restore the faction system. During a commotion between the factionless and the faction members, several people are killed, including Evelyns right-hand man, Edward. Tris is invited into a meeting with the Allegiant, whose leaders, Cara and Johanna Reyes, have formulated a plan to usurp Evelyn as well as sending envoys outside the city. Tris is selected for the expedition, alongside Tobias, Cara, Christina, Peter Hayes, Uriah Pedrad, and Tori Wu. Tris asks Tobias to free her brother, Caleb, upon hearing about his planned execution. During the journey, Tori is killed by the factionless, while the others manage to escape and meet with Tobias mentor, Amar, long thought to be dead. The two take them to the Bureau of Genetic Welfare and meet with its leader, David.David explains that their city—Chicago—is walled off from the outside world as part of an experiment sanctioned by the US Government to produce more genetically pure (GP), or ""Divergents"", from the genetically-damaged (GD), which are the result of a failed experiment to correct human genes that led to the ""Purity War"". David gives Tris her mother, Natalies journal detailing her life before entering Chicago: she was a refugee from Milwaukee who joined the Bureau and later became a volunteer in order to stop the killings of the Divergents at the hands of Erudite and escort them safely; those rescued include Amar and Toris brother, George. Meanwhile, Tobias is disheartened when he learns that he is not in fact a true Divergent. Sympathetic to Tobias, GD Bureau staff, Nita, persuades him to join with her and the other GDs living in the fringes to join a rebellion against the GP staff. Tris is skeptical, albeit influenced by a jealousy of Nita, when Tobias tells her the plan. From a sympathetic GP staff informant, Matthew, Nita attempts to enter the Weapon Room, which involves setting a bomb that renders Uriah brain-damaged. Tris stops Nitas rampage by holding David hostage before wounding her, allowing her to be arrested.Tris is elevated to the position of council member, although Nitas information has made her realize that the Bureau is the one that supplied Erudite with the simulation serums that controlled Dauntless to invade Abnegation. Through the security cameras, it is revealed that Marcus Eaton, having been banished by Evelyn, is teaming up with Johanna to steal the factionless weapons, which will be countered by Evelyn releasing the death serum on everyone. Tris learns that David intends to release memory serums capable of erasing memories to the Chicago population to save his experiment. To counteract this, she formulates a plan to release the memory serum towards the Bureau members while Tobias, Christina, and Peter, with Amar and Georges help, head back to Chicago to give antiserums to Christina and Uriahs families. Tobias diverts halfway while carrying a memory serum, intending to inject it to his mother. However, when he instead offers her to avert the war in exchange for becoming his mother again, Evelyn agrees and goes outside to negotiate a peace settlement with Johanna and Marcus, requiring her to go into self-exile for two years while Marcus has to vow never to attempt to lead Chicago. Tobias instead gives the memory serum to Peter, who intends to start anew.Back at the Bureau, Caleb volunteers to expose the memory serum, a certain suicidal mission due to the death serum planted there. However, Tris replaces him at the last second. Though she is successful in repelling the death serum, David has been waiting for her inside and proceeds to shoot her as she works to expose the memory serum. As she lies dying, Tris sees visions of her mother embracing her before succumbing to her wounds and dying. Tobias, Christina, and Peter head back to the Bureau, only to hear from Cara about Tris death in an attempt to expose the serum. Tobias goes into a deep depression and is about to drink the memory serum to erase his memories with Tris, until Christina stops him. In the meantime, Uriahs family: his brother, Ezekiel ""Zeke"", and his mother, Hana, are called in to be with Uriah before his life support is unplugged.Two and a half years later, Chicago is opening and rebuilding itself, with people moving in and out, regardless of their gene purity. Tobias, having been working as an assistant council member under Johanna, welcomes Evelyn back from her self-exile. To celebrate Choosing Day, he, Christina, Caleb, Zeke, Shauna, Cara, and Matthew decide to ride a zipline from the Hancock Building, where Tobias scatters Tris ashes, having come to accept her sacrifice and death.",110000000,"[{""id"": 12, ""name"": ""Adventure""}, {""id"": 878, ""name"": ""Science Fiction""}]",http://www.thedivergentseries.movie/#allegiant,262504,"[{""id"": 818, ""name"": ""based on novel""}, {""id"": 2020, ""name"": ""revolution""}, {""id"": 4565, ""name"": ""dystopia""}, {""id"": 9663, ""name"": ""sequel""}, {""id"": 162988, ""name"": ""dystopic future""}, {""id"": 206298, ""name"": ""young adult""}, {""id"": 223438, ""name"": ""based on young adult novel""}]",en,Beatrice Prior and Tobias Eaton venture into the world outside of the fence and are taken into protective custody by a mysterious agency known as the Bureau of Genetic Welfare.,86.105615,"[{""name"": ""Summit Entertainment"", ""id"": 491}, {""name"": ""Lionsgate"", ""id"": 1632}, {""name"": ""Mandeville Films"", ""id"": 10227}, {""name"": ""Red Wagon Entertainment"", ""id"": 14440}]","[{""iso_3166_1"": ""US"", ""name"": ""United States of America""}]",3/9/2016,179246868,121,"[{""iso_639_1"": ""en"", ""name"": ""English""}]",Released,Break the boundaries of your world,Allegiant,5.9,1998,0.5,0.5,0.817815423,0.5,0.317815423,-0.317815423,0,0.211876949,1.629516982

The Chipmunks and the Chipettes, especially Alvin, end up creating pandemonium. Later that night, after Dave leaves to eat at the captains table and apologize for Alvins behavior, Alvin sneaks out to the ships casino, followed by Simon, who hopes to keep Alvin out of further exposure; meanwhile the Chipettes go to the ships dance club, leaving Theodore alone in the room, watching an unsuitable monster movie. Dave discovers that his old boss, Ian Hawke, is working as the ships safety monitor dressed as a pelican, and is out to inform the captain if the Chipmunks and Chipettes cause more problems. Simon and Alvin are eventually caught in the casino, and are brought back to the room, along with the Chipettes, and all are accused by Dave for not being trustworthy. The next day, Alvin goes para-sailing on a kite, but the kite flies away with him and the other Chipmunks. Dave goes on a hang-glider to find them, but Ian attempts to stop him, and they both end up in the Pacific Ocean.Meanwhile, the Chipmunks find an island, and they sleep for the night. Dave enlists Ians help to find the same island and begin looking for the Chipmunks. The next morning, the Chipmunks go and find food, and while they do so, an island castaway named Zoe shows up and sees the Chipmunks and Chipettes for the first time. They then go to Zoes tree house, where Eleanor sprains her ankle after falling off a zip line, and Simon gets bitten by a spider, the side effects including personality changes and loss of inhibition.The morning after, everyone observes Simons personality has changed, and he has no memory of being Simon; he also thinks he is a French adventurous chipmunk named Simone.

Later, Zoe takes Simone, Jeanette, Eleanor, and Theodore to a lake with a waterfall, and Simone finds a cave. He returns with a gold bracelet which he gives to Jeanette as a crown. Brittany and Alvin, having become the ""responsible"" ones, see an active volcano the next day, and they decide that they have to leave the island with the others. Theodore and ""Simone"" find Dave and Ian, and they go to meet with the other chipmunks. With Alvin and Brittany in charge, they are all assigned jobs to build a raft to leave the island. When Jeanette and ""Simone"" go and look for food, ""Simone"" is knocked unconscious, and Jeanette is kidnapped; ""Simone"" reverts to Simon afterward.Everyone finds Simon awake, and he cannot remember anything since the change. They discover that Zoe has taken Jeanette, and they head towards the waterfall. When they approach the tree log to cross, Dave and Alvin decide that they will go and find Jeanette. As Zoe encourages Jeanette to find the treasure in the cave by tying her to a rope, Alvin and Dave come to her rescue. The island begins to rumble again, as Zoe lets go of the rope, and Jeanette runs with Dave and Alvin back to the raft, but is pulled back at the log bridge. Simon swings in to help Jeanette before Alvin can cut the ropes with a Swiss Army Knife. Dave is left hanging from the log when it almost gives away.Alvin and Ian convince Zoe to help save Dave. They then run towards the raft and escape the eruption. While on the raft, Zoe apologizes to Jeanette for kidnapping her and forcing her to retrieve the treasure. As a gift, Jeanette gives Zoe the gold bracelet that Simon had given to her. Alvin reconciles with Dave, and they are rescued. The Chipmunks and Chipettes perform at the International Music Awards.

45,46,American Hustle,2013,/wiki/American_Hustle,"In 1978, con artists Irving Rosenfeld and Sydney Prosser have started a relationship and are working together. Sydney has improved Rosenfelds scams, posing as English aristocrat ""Lady Edith Greensly."" Irving loves Sydney but is hesitant to leave his unstable wife Rosalyn, fearing he will lose contact with his adoptive son Danny. Rosalyn has also threatened to report Irving to the police if he leaves her. FBI agent Richie DiMaso catches Irving and Sydney in a loan scam, but offers to release them if Irving can line up four additional arrests. Richie believes Sydney is English but has proof that her claim of aristocracy is fraudulent. Sydney tells Irving she will manipulate Richie, distancing herself from Irving.Irving has a friend pretending to be a wealthy Arab sheik looking for potential investments in America. An associate of Irvings suggests the sheik do business with Mayor Carmine Polito of Camden, New Jersey, who is campaigning to revitalize gambling in Atlantic City but has struggled in fundraising. Carmine seems to have a genuine desire to help the areas economy and his constituents. Richie devises a plan to make Mayor Polito the target of a sting operation, despite the objections of Irving and of Richies boss, Stoddard Thorsen. Sydney helps Richie manipulate an FBI secretary into making an unauthorized wire transfer of $2,000,000. When Stoddards boss, Anthony Amado, hears of the operation, he praises Richies initiative, pressuring Stoddard to continue.Carmine leaves their meeting when Richie presses him to accept a cash bribe. Irving convinces Carmine the sheik is legitimate, expressing his dislike of Richie, and the two become friends. Richie arranges for Carmine to meet the sheik, and without consulting the others, has Mexican-American FBI agent Paco Hernandez play the sheik, which displeases Irving. Carmine brings the sheik to a casino party, explaining mobsters are there and it is a necessary part of doing business. Irving is surprised to hear that Mafia boss Victor Tellegio, right-hand man to Meyer Lansky, is present and that he wants to meet the sheik. Tellegio explains that the sheik needs to become an American citizen and that Carmine will need to expedite the process. Tellegio also requires a $10,000,000 wire transfer to prove the sheiks legitimacy.Richie confesses his strong attraction to Sydney but becomes confused and aggressive when she drops her English accent and admits to being from Albuquerque. Rosalyn starts an affair with mobster Pete Musane, whom she met at the party. She mentions her belief that Irving is working with the IRS, causing Pete to threaten Irving, who promises to prove the sheiks investment is real. Irving later confronts Rosalyn, who admits she told Pete and agrees to keep quiet but wants a divorce. With Carmines help, Richie and Irving videotape members of Congress receiving bribes. Richie assaults Stoddard in a fight over the money and later convinces Amado that he needs the $10,000,000 to get Tellegio, but gets only $2,000,000. A meeting is arranged at the offices of Tellegios lawyer, Alfonse Simone, but Tellegio does not appear.Irving visits Carmine and admits to the scam, but says he has a plan to help him. Carmine throws Irving out and the loss of their friendship deeply upsets Irving. The federal agents inform Irving that their $2,000,000 are missing and that they have received an anonymous offer to return the money in exchange for Irving and Sydneys immunity and a reduced sentence for Carmine. It is revealed that the Alfonse Simone whom Richie had arranged the wire transfer with was a con man working with Irving and Sydney. Amado accepts the deal and Stoddard removes Richie from the case, which ends his career. The Congressmen are prosecuted and so is Carmine, who is sentenced to 18 months in prison. Irving and Sydney move in together and open a legitimate art gallery, while Rosalyn lives with Pete and shares custody of Danny with Irving.",40000000,"[{""id"": 18, ""name"": ""Drama""}, {""id"": 80, ""name"": ""Crime""}]",http://www.americanhustle-movie.com/,168672,"[{""id"": 10453, ""name"": ""con artist""}, {""id"": 11454, ""name"": ""scam""}, {""id"": 11578, ""name"": ""mobster""}, {""id"": 18525, ""name"": ""fbi agent""}]",en,"A con man, Irving Rosenfeld, along with his seductive partner Sydney Prosser, is forced to work for a wild FBI agent, Richie DiMaso, who pushes them into a world of Jersey powerbrokers and mafia.",49.664128,"[{""name"": ""Columbia Pictures"", ""id"": 5}, {""name"": ""Atlas Entertainment"", ""id"": 507}, {""name"": ""Annapurna Pictures"", ""id"": 13184}]","[{""iso_3166_1"": ""US"", ""name"": ""United States of America""}]",12/12/2013,251171807,138,"[{""iso_639_1"": ""en"", ""name"": ""English""}]",Released,Everyone Hustles To Survive,American Hustle,6.8,2807,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.213331491,0.286668509,0,0,0.09555617,6.279295175

While Mia calls the police, she and John are attacked by the Higgins killers. The police arrive and shoot one killer, a man, dead while the female killer commits suicide by slitting her own throat inside the nursery while holding the porcelain doll.

The family rents an apartment in Pasadena and, after finding the doll that John had discarded since Annabelles previous attack in one of their boxes, another set of paranormal events plagues Mia and her daughter.

During a storm, Mia encounters an enigmatic figure in the buildings basement who begins pursuing her before she escapes.Mia calls back Detective Clarkin to gather information about Annabelle and the cultist and learns that the cult intends to summon supernatural beings. With the help of bookseller and fellow tenant Evelyn, Mia realizes that the cult practiced devil worship, which summoned a demon who followed the family after they moved to their apartment in order to claim a soul. Upon returning home, Mia and Leah are attacked by the demon who reveals itself while manipulating the doll. Mia and John contact their parish priest, Father Perez, who informs them that demons sometimes attach themselves to inanimate objects as an advantage to accomplish their goals and that a human soul must be offered for a purpose. Without any hopes of exorcising the demon out of the doll, Father Perez decides to take it away to seek help from the Warrens for investigation. But before he can enter the church, the demon impersonating Annabelles spirit attacks him and grabs the doll.The priest is hospitalized on the next day and, when John checks on him, Father Perez warns the latter that after sensing its powerful presence, the demons true intention is to claim Mias soul.

Believing the technology is dangerous, Pym vows to hide it as long as he lives.In the present day, Pyms estranged daughter, Hope van Dyne, and former protégé, Darren Cross, have forced him out of his company, Pym Technologies. Cross is close to perfecting a shrinking suit of his own, the Yellowjacket, which horrifies Pym.Upon his release from prison, well-meaning thief Scott Lang moves in with his old cellmate, Luis. Lang visits his daughter Cassie unannounced and is chastised by his former wife Maggie and her police-detective fiancé, Paxton, for not providing child support. Unable to hold a job because of his criminal record, Lang agrees to join Luis crew and commit a burglary. Lang breaks into a house and cracks its safe, but only finds what he believes to be an old motorcycle suit, which he takes home. After trying the suit on, Lang accidentally shrinks himself to the size of an insect.  Terrified by the experience, he returns the suit to the house, but is arrested on the way out. Pym, the homeowner, visits Lang in jail and smuggles the suit into his cell to help him break out.Pym, who manipulated Lang through an unknowing Luis into stealing the suit as a test, wants Lang to become the new Ant-Man to steal the Yellowjacket from Cross. Having been spying on Cross after discovering his intentions, Van Dyne and Pym train Lang to fight and to control ants. While Van Dyne harbors resentment towards Pym about her mother Janets death, he reveals that Janet, known as the Wasp, disappeared into a subatomic quantum realm while disabling a Soviet nuclear missile. Pym warns Lang that he could suffer a similar fate if he overrides his suits regulator. They send him to steal a device that will aid their heist from the Avengers headquarters, where he briefly fights Sam Wilson.Cross perfects the Yellowjacket and hosts an unveiling ceremony at Pym Technologies headquarters. Lang, along with his crew and a swarm of flying ants, infiltrates the building during the event, sabotages the companys servers, and plants explosives. When he attempts to steal the Yellowjacket, he, along with Pym and Van Dyne, are captured by Cross, who intends to sell both the Yellowjacket and Ant-Man suits to Hydra. Lang breaks free and he and Van Dyne dispatch most of the Hydra agents, though one flees with a vial of Cross particles and Pym is shot. Lang pursues Cross, while the explosives detonate, imploding the building as Pym and Van Dyne escape.Cross dons the Yellowjacket and attacks Lang before Lang is arrested by Paxton. Cross takes Cassie hostage to lure Lang into another fight. Lang overrides the regulator and shrinks to subatomic size to penetrate Cross suit and sabotage it to shrink uncontrollably, killing Cross. Lang disappears into the quantum realm but manages to reverse the effects and returns to the macroscopic world. Out of gratitude for Langs heroism, Paxton covers for Lang to keep him out of prison.

55,56,Apollo 18,2011,/wiki/Apollo_18_(film),"In December 1973, the crew of the cancelled Apollo 18 mission is informed that it will now proceed as a top secret Department of Defense (DoD) mission disguised as a satellite launch. Commander Nathan Walker, Lieutenant colonel John Grey, and Captain Ben Anderson are launched toward the Moon to place detectors to alert the United States of any impending ICBM attacks from the USSR.Grey remains in orbit aboard the Freedom command module while Walker and Anderson land on the Moon in the lunar module Liberty. While planting one of the detectors, the pair take rock samples. After returning to Liberty, the pair hear noises outside and a camera captures a small rock moving nearby. Houston claims the noises are interference from the ICBM detectors. Anderson finds a rock sample on the floor of Liberty despite having secured the samples. During further lunar exploration they discover footprints that lead them to a bloodstained, functioning Soviet LK lander, and a dead cosmonaut in a nearby crater. Walker queries Houston about the Soviet presence, but he is told only to continue with the mission.The following day the pair find that the flag they had planted is missing. Their mission complete, the crew prepares to leave, but the launch is aborted when Liberty suffers violent shaking. An inspection reveals extensive damage to Liberty and their flag shredded. Walter finds non-human tracks outside ""Liberty"" and  cites them as evidence of extraterrestrial life. Walker feels something moving inside his spacesuit and is horrified as a spider-like creature crawls across the inside of his helmet. Walker disappears from view and Anderson finds him unconscious outside of Liberty. Walker later denies the events. A wound is discovered on Walkers chest; Anderson removes a Moon rock embedded within him. The pair find themselves unable to contact Houston or Grey due to increased levels of interference from an unknown source.Anderson speculates that the true intention of the ICBM warning devices is to monitor the aliens, and that the devices are the source of the interference, only to discover something has destroyed them when they attempt to switch them off. Walker shows signs of a developing infection and he becomes increasingly paranoid. The mission cameras capture the rock samples moving around in the interior of Liberty, revealing that the aliens are camouflaged as Moon rocks. Increasingly delusional, Walker attempts to destroy the cameras within Liberty, but he accidentally damages the system controls, causing Liberty to depressurize. Realizing the Soviet LK is their only source of oxygen, the pair travel to the LK lander in their lunar rover. Walker causes the vehicle to crash as he runs away, believing he should not leave the Moon, because of the risk of spreading the infection to Earth.Anderson awakens and tracks Walker to the crater where they found the cosmonaut. Walker is pulled into the crater by the creatures. Anderson gives chase, but he is confronted by the aliens, and flees to the Soviet LK. Anderson uses its radio to contact USSR Mission Control who connect him to the Department of Defense. The deputy secretary informs Anderson that they cannot allow him to return to Earth, admitting they are aware of the situation and incorrectly believe he is also infected. Anderson manages to contact Grey and they make arrangements for Anderson to return to Freedom. Anderson prepares the lander for launch, but Walker arrives, revealing he had survived the alien encounter earlier. However, he is now completely psychotic and demands to be let in. When Anderson refuses to let him in, he tries to break the landers window with a hammer. Before Walker can enter the vehicle, he is attacked by a swarm of creatures inside his helmet, which causes his head to explode, killing him.Anderson launches, but the DoD warns Grey that Anderson is infected and orders him to abort the rescue or communication will be cut off, without which the CSM will be unable to return to Earth. The landers engines shut off as it enters orbit, and it is in free fall. Small rocks within the craft float in the air, some of which reveal themselves to be alien creatures. Anderson is attacked and infected by the creatures, preventing him from controlling the vehicle. Grey tells Anderson that he is moving too fast as the LK speeds towards Freedom, and the space footage ends abruptly, as the LK and Freedom collide.The film concludes with a statement giving the ""official"" fate of the astronauts, describing them as having died in various accidents that left their bodies unrecoverable.

57,58,Argo,2012,/wiki/Argo_(2012_film),"On November 4, 1979, Iranian activists storm the United States embassy in Tehran in retaliation for President Jimmy Carter giving the Shah asylum in the U.S. during the Iranian Revolution. 60 of the embassy staff are taken as hostages, but six avoid capture and are sheltered in the home of Canadian ambassador Ken Taylor. With the escapees situation kept secret, the U.S. State Department begins to explore options for exfiltrating them from Iran. Tony Mendez, a U.S. Central Intelligence Agency exfiltration specialist, is brought in for consultation. He criticizes the proposals, but is at a loss when asked for an alternative. While on the phone with his son, he is inspired by watching Battle for the Planet of the Apes and begins plans for creating a cover story for the escapees:  that they are Canadian filmmakers who are in Iran scouting exotic locations for a science-fiction film.Mendez contacts John Chambers, a Hollywood make-up artist who had previously worked for the CIA. Chambers puts Mendez in touch with film producer Lester Siegel. Together, they set up a phony film production company, publicize their plans, and successfully establish the pretense of developing Argo, a ""science fantasy adventure"" in the style of Star Wars, to lend credibility to the cover story. Meanwhile, the escapees grow restless. The revolutionaries reassemble embassy photographs shredded before the takeover and finally realize that some personnel are unaccounted for.Posing as a producer for Argo, Mendez enters Iran under the alias Kevin Harkins and meets with the six escapees. He provides them with Canadian passports and fake identities. Although afraid to trust Mendezs scheme, they reluctantly go along, knowing that he is risking his own life too. A scouting visit to the bazaar to maintain their cover story takes a bad turn when they are harassed by a hostile shopkeeper, but their Iranian culture contact hustles them away from the hostile crowd.Mendez is told that the operation has been cancelled to avoid conflicting with a planned military rescue of the hostages. He pushes ahead anyway, forcing his boss Jack ODonnell to hastily re-obtain authorization for the mission and confirm their tickets on a Swissair flight. Tensions rise at the airport, where the escapees ticket reservations are confirmed at the last minute, and the head guards call to the fake production company in Hollywood is answered only at the last second. The group boards the airliner, which takes off just as the Revolutionary Guards at the airport are informed of the ruse and try to stop them.To protect the hostages remaining in Tehran from retaliation, all U.S. involvement in the rescue is suppressed and full credit is given to the Canadian government and its ambassador (who shuts down the embassy and leaves Iran with his wife as the operation is underway). The ambassadors Iranian housekeeper, who had known about the Americans and lied to the revolutionaries to protect them, escapes to Iraq. Mendez is awarded the Intelligence Star, but due to the missions classified nature, he receives the medal in secret and has to return it afterwards. The award is restored to him after the Canadian Caper is declassified in 1997.",44500000,"[{""id"": 18, ""name"": ""Drama""}, {""id"": 53, ""name"": ""Thriller""}]",http://argothemovie.warnerbros.com/,68734,"[{""id"": 591, ""name"": ""cia""}, {""id"": 1157, ""name"": ""wife husband relationship""}, {""id"": 1937, ""name"": ""document""}, {""id"": 2020, ""name"": ""revolution""}, {""id"": 2430, ""name"": ""hiding place""}, {""id"": 2519, ""name"": ""canadian""}, {""id"": 2562, ""name"": ""press conference""}, {""id"": 5565, ""name"": ""biography""}, {""id"": 15292, ""name"": ""hanged man""}, {""id"": 34061, ""name"": ""american abroad""}, {""id"": 159306, ""name"": ""crane""}, {""id"": 159514, ""name"": ""subtitled scene""}, {""id"": 161996, ""name"": ""movie poster""}, {""id"": 165340, ""name"": ""based on article""}, {""id"": 185677, ""name"": ""extraction""}, {""id"": 185684, ""name"": ""iran hostage crisis""}, {""id"": 185686, ""name"": ""sweatshop""}, {""id"": 185692, ""name"": ""intelligence agent""}, {""id"": 185699, ""name"": ""film studio""}, {""id"": 185702, ""name"": ""langley virginia""}, {""id"": 208289, ""name"": ""1980s""}]",en,"As the Iranian revolution reaches a boiling point, a CIA 'exfiltration' specialist concocts a risky plan to free six Americans who have found shelter at the home of the Canadian ambassador.",62.01056,"[{""name"": ""GK Films"", ""id"": 3281}, {""name"": ""Warner Bros."", ""id"": 6194}, {""name"": ""Smokehouse Pictures"", ""id"": 22695}]","[{""iso_3166_1"": ""US"", ""name"": ""United States of America""}]",10/11/2012,232324128,120,"[{""iso_639_1"": ""en"", ""name"": ""English""}, {""iso_639_1"": ""fa"", ""name"": ""\u0641\u0627\u0631\u0633\u06cc""}]",Released,The movie was fake.

58,59,Arthur Christmas,2011,/wiki/Arthur_Christmas,"On Christmas Eve, hundreds of Christmas elves helm the command centre of Santa Clauss mile-wide, ultra-high-tech sleigh-esque craft, the S-1. The current Santa (named Malcolm) and the Christmas elves deliver presents to every child in the world using advanced equipment and military precision. These complex operations are micromanaged by thousands more elves, under the command of Malcolms militaristic eldest son and heir-apparent Steve, and his obsequious elfin assistant, Peter, at mission control underneath the North Pole. Meanwhile, his younger son - the clumsy, fearful yet enthusiastic Arthur - devotedly answers the letters to Santa. During one of the delivery operations in Poland a child wakes up and almost sees Malcolm due to an accidentally activated toy; in the tense escape operation, a Christmas elf aboard the S-1 inadvertently leans on a button, causing a present to fall from the supply line and go unnoticed.Having completed his 70th mission, Malcolm is portrayed as far past his prime, and whose role in field operations is now largely symbolic. Nonetheless, he is held in high esteem, and delivers a congratulatory speech to the enraptured elves. Malcolm announces he looks forward to his 71st, much to the frustration of Steve, who had prepared to succeed his father as Santa at the conclusion of this mission. During their family Christmas dinner, Arthurs suggestion for the family to play a board game degenerates into a tense quarrel between Malcolm and Steve, while Malcolms father and predecessor Grandsanta, bored by retirement, resentfully criticises their over-modernization. After Grandsanta knocks the board off the table, Steves PDA (a high tech device named a HOHO) flashes and he leaves the table in a hurry. Later, their father shares with his wife Margaret his grave doubts about his self-identity should he retire.Arthur follows Steve, and the two learn that a Christmas elf named Bryony Shelfley found the missed present - a wrapped bicycle for a little girl in England called Gwen, to whose letter Arthur had personally responded. Arthur alerts his father, who is at a loss as to how to handle the situation; Steve argues that one missed present out of billions is an acceptable error whose correction can wait a few days, citing this years Christmas as the most successful in history. Grandsanta on the other hand, on learning of the dire situation, proposes delivering the gift using Evie, his old wooden sleigh, and the great-great-grandchildren of the original eight reindeer, forcefully whisking away a reluctant Arthur and a stowaway Bryony. In the process the three get lost on three different continents, lose several of their reindeer, and land in danger several times, ultimately being mistaken for aliens and causing an international military incident. Through all this, Arthur eventually learns, to his compounding disappointment, that Grandsantas true motive is to fulfill his ego, Steve refuses to help them out of petty resentment and the possibility of his brother being made hero overshadowing his work, and that his own father has gone to bed, apparently content even though a present was not delivered.Finally, stranded in Cuba after losing the sleigh, Arthur renews his sense of purpose: that it all comes down to having presents delivered, regardless of how it is done and who did it. With Grandsantas and Bryonys help, he manages to recover the sleigh. Meanwhile, the elves grow increasingly alarmed at rumours of the neglected delivery and the Clauses unthinkable indifference, sending them into a panic. In response, Malcolm, Margaret, and Steve take the high-tech sleigh-craft to deliver a superior present ... albeit to the wrong child.Arthur and his company manage to reach England, but lose the remaining reindeer; furthermore a US Predator drone scrambled by Chief De Silva of UNFITA intercepts and opens fire on the sleigh believing them to be aliens. Grandsanta sacrifices the sleigh, while Arthur and Bryony parachute to the ground. Ultimately with Margaret and Bryonys help, all the male Clauses arrive at Gwens house before she awakens, only to have all but Arthur quarrel about who gets to actually place the gift. Noticing that only Arthur truly cares about the girls feelings, the elder Clauses collectively realize that he is the sole worthy successor. As a result, Malcolm gives Arthur the honour, and Steve, recognizing his own shortcomings, forfeits his supposed birthright and acknowledges his brothers worthiness to take up the mantle. In a fitting conclusion, Gwen glimpses a snow-bearded Arthur in a wind-buffeted sweater just before he vanishes up into the S-1.In a postscript, Malcolm goes into a happy retirement with Margaret - where he also becomes Grandsantas much-desired new companion - and plays Arthurs board game with him for many happy hours. Meanwhile, Steve finds true contentment as the chief operating officer of the North Pole. Bryony is promoted to Vice-President of Packing, Pacific Division. In a nod to traditionalism once neglected, the high-tech S-1 is re-christened EVIE in honour of Grandsantas old sleigh, and refitted to be pulled by a team of 5,000 reindeer - led by the original 8, all of whom managed to return home safely via innate navigational abilities. Finally, Arthur happily guides the entire enterprise in the proper spirit as the new Santa.",76135364.24,"[{""id"": 18, ""name"": ""Drama""}, {""id"": 16, ""name"": ""Animation""}, {""id"": 10751, ""name"": ""Family""}, {""id"": 35, ""name"": ""Comedy""}]",http://www.arthurchristmas.com/,51052,"[{""id"": 65, ""name"": ""holiday""}, {""id"": 1991, ""name"": ""santa claus""}, {""id"": 179431, ""name"": ""duringcreditsstinger""}, {""id"": 187056, ""name"": ""woman director""}, {""id"": 207317, ""name"": ""christmas""}]",en,"Each Christmas, Santa and his vast army of highly trained elves produce gifts and distribute them around the world in one night.

59,60,"As Above, So Below",2014,"/wiki/As_Above,_So_Below_(film)","Scarlett Marlowe, a young alchemist, is searching for the philosophers stone, a legendary substance capable of turning base metals into gold and granting eternal life. After finding the Rose Key and narrowly escaping a cave collapse in Iran, she travels to Paris, where she enlists the help of her ex-boyfriend, George, and cameraman Benji. They use the Rose Key to translate the headstone of Nicholas Flamel, who wrote about the philosophers stone. The headstone contains a riddle that leads them to believe that the philosophers stone is hidden 370.5 feet underneath the streets of Paris. Scarlett also enlists the help of a guide named Papillon, his girlfriend Souxie, and their friend Zed, who are familiar with the layout of the Catacombs of Paris. George refuses to follow the group into the catacombs, but is driven underground with the rest when a policeman spots them trespassing. After crawling through a narrow tunnel which collapses behind them, they encounter female cultists who appear to be performing a mysterious ritual. The group then find themselves in a blocked tunnel that Papillon is reluctant to enter, as people who have entered have never been seen again.After venturing deeper into the catacombs, the group encounter La Taupe, a friend of Papillon who disappeared into the catacombs years earlier. He agrees to guide them out, explaining that the only way out is down. They eventually find a tomb filled with treasure, as well as the philosophers stone. Removing the stone, Scarlett realizes that the treasure is a trap, and the chamber collapses. With the philosophers stone, Scarlett is able to heal injuries that Souxie sustained in the fall. La Taupe is lost under the rubble, and the group decide to leave him behind.The group find a Gnostic Star of David, which symbolizes the notion ""As above, so below."" Seeing that a door has been drawn onto the ceiling above, Scarlett finds a real door in the floor below. Beyond the door, the group finds the entrance to a tunnel that is marked with the phrase ""Abandon all hope, ye who enter here"" in Greek, identical to the entrance to Hell in Dantes Inferno.Passing through, they find a reflection of the room they left behind. There, they discover La Taupe, who kills Souxie before disappearing. The remaining members of the group realize that they must continue deeper into the catacombs in order to escape, and they climb down a hole. However, Benji is pushed to his death by the lead female cultist. Leaving his body behind, the rest encounter a man sitting in a burning car, which recalls an incident in which Papillon was forced to leave someone to die in a car crash; the man pulls Papillon into the burning car before it disappears and Papillon is left buried upside down. The rest of the group are unable to pull Papillon from the ground, and they decide to continue into the catacombs. Visions of demons follow the group through dark tunnels, and one attacks George. After the philosophers stone fails to heal his injuries, George murmurs, ""Vitriol."" Remembering the word from a riddle, Scarlett realizes that the stone itself is yet another trap. Only by returning it will she find the real philosophers stone.As she races back to the tomb, she finds a hanged man, whom she recognizes as her father. She apologizes to him for not answering the phone the night that he killed himself. She then returns to the tomb, where she finds a polished mirror that makes her realize that she possesses the magical abilities of the philosophers stone. Scarlett returns to George and heals him with a kiss. She then explains to George and Zed that the only way to escape is to admit to their torments, just as she admitted that she feels responsible for her fathers suicide. George admits that he accidentally allowed his brother to drown when the pair were kids because he got lost looking for help. Zed admits that he has a son he knows is his, but chooses not to acknowledge, which explains the visions of a running boy he has been seeing during their journey. As the demons continue to chase them, the group jump down a deep hole. At the bottom, the hole above them closes and a manhole appears on the ground below. Jumping through, the group find themselves right side up on a street overlooking the Notre Dame. Scarlett and George hold each other, realizing that they are safe, while a dazed Zed walks away into the night.",5000000,"[{""id"": 27, ""name"": ""Horror""}, {""id"": 53, ""name"": ""Thriller""}]",http://www.asabovesobelowmovie.com/,256274,"[{""id"": 90, ""name"": ""paris""}, {""id"": 1454, ""name"": ""treasure""}, {""id"": 4194, ""name"": ""catacombs""}, {""id"": 14760, ""name"": ""scientist""}, {""id"": 18064, ""name"": ""singing in a car""}, {""id"": 41586, ""name"": ""archaeologist""}, {""id"": 162085, ""name"": ""loss of friend""}, {""id"": 162177, ""name"": ""subjective camera""}, {""id"": 163053, ""name"": ""found footage""}, {""id"": 206646, ""name"": ""thick accent""}, {""id"": 206647, ""name"": ""female archeologist""}, {""id"": 206648, ""name"": ""burning car""}, {""id"": 206649, ""name"": ""philosopher's stone""}, {""id"": 206650, ""name"": ""french accent""}, {""id"": 206651, ""name"": ""rapping in a car""}]",en,"When a team of explorers ventures into the catacombs that lie beneath the streets of Paris, they uncover the dark secret that lies within this city of the dead.",26.510558,"[{""name"": ""Universal Pictures"", ""id"": 33}, {""name"": ""Legendary Pictures"", ""id"": 923}, {""name"": ""Brothers Dowdle Productions"", ""id"": 66930}]","[{""iso_3166_1"": ""US"", ""name"": ""United States of America""}]",8/14/2014,40100000,93,"[{""iso_639_1"": ""en"", ""name"": ""English""}]",Released,The only way out is down.,"As Above, So Below",6.1,766,0.184022516,0.023308694,0.050271809,0.5,-0.449728191,-0.026963115,0.160713822,0.212468376,8.02
61,62,Avatar,2015,/wiki/Avatar_(2009_film),"In 2154, humans have depleted Earths natural resources, leading to a severe energy crisis. The Resources Development Administration (RDA for short) mines for a valuable mineral — unobtanium — on Pandora, a densely forested habitable moon orbiting the gas giant Polyphemus in the Alpha Centauri star system. Pandora, whose atmosphere is poisonous to humans, is inhabited by the Navi, a species of 10-foot tall (3.0 m), blue-skinned, sapient humanoids that live in harmony with nature and worship a mother goddess named Eywa.To explore Pandoras biosphere, scientists use Navi-human hybrids called ""avatars"", operated by genetically matched humans; Jake Sully, a paraplegic former Marine, replaces his deceased identical twin brother as an operator of one. Dr. Grace Augustine, head of the Avatar Program, considers Sully an inadequate replacement but accepts his assignment as a bodyguard. While protecting the avatars of Grace and fellow scientist Dr. Norm Spellman as they collect biological data, Jakes avatar is attacked by a thanator and flees into the forest, where he is rescued by Neytiri, a female Navi. Witnessing an auspicious sign, she takes him to her clan, whereupon Neytiris mother Moat, the clans spiritual leader, orders her daughter to initiate Jake into their society.Colonel Miles Quaritch, head of RDAs private security force, promises Jake that the company will restore his legs if he gathers information about the Navi and the clans gathering place, a giant tree called Hometree, which stands above the richest deposit of unobtanium in the area. When Grace learns of this, she transfers herself, Jake, and Norm to an outpost. Over the following three months, Jake grows to sympathize with the natives. After Jake is initiated into the tribe, he and Neytiri choose each other as mates, and soon afterward, Jake reveals his change of allegiance when he attempts to disable a bulldozer that threatens to destroy a sacred Navi site. When Quaritch shows a video recording of Jakes attack on the bulldozer to Administrator Parker Selfridge, and another in which Jake admits that the Navi will never abandon Hometree, Selfridge orders Hometree destroyed.Despite Graces argument that destroying Hometree could damage the biological neural network native to Pandora, Selfridge gives Jake and Grace one hour to convince the Navi to evacuate before commencing the attack. While trying to warn the Navi, Jake confesses to being a spy, and the Navi take him and Grace captive. Seeing this, Quaritchs men destroy Hometree, killing Neytiris father (the clan chief) and many others. Moat frees Jake and Grace, but they are detached from their avatars and imprisoned by Quaritchs forces. Pilot Trudy Chacón, disgusted by Quaritchs brutality, frees Jake and Grace and airlifts them to Graces outpost, but during the escape Quaritch fires at them, hitting Grace.To regain the Navis trust, Jake connects his mind to that of Toruk, a dragon-like predator feared and honored by the Navi. Jake finds the refugees at the sacred Tree of Souls and pleads with Moat to heal Grace. The clan attempts to transfer Grace from her human body into her avatar with the aid of the Tree of Souls, but she dies before the process can be completed.

Although secretly jealous and embittered by the fact that her ""fat friend"" is now engaged, Regan notifies their two other friends, the sardonic cocaine addict Gena (Lizzy Caplan) and the rowdy party girl Katie (Isla Fisher).Six months later, the women are preparing for Beckys impromptu bachelorette party that evening; Gena flies into New York from Los Angeles, and the four meet at the hotel, where Katie announces that Gena has brought cocaine for all of them to do. At the dinner party that night, Gena runs into her ex-boyfriend Clyde (Adam Scott), whom she sees flirting with Dales younger sister, and Katie runs into Joe (Kyle Bornheimer), a former classmate and pot dealer. Trevor (James Marsden), the best man, gives a speech at the party, and Gena, high on cocaine, reveals in her toast that she once caught Becky forcing herself to throw up in the high school bathrooms.After the dinner, the women go to their suite, where Katies gay co-worker arrives and does a striptease for the women, but Becky stops it after he jokingly calls her ""Pigface"", a cruel nickname of hers in high school. Becky leaves the bachelorette party, and Regan, Gena and Katie are left in the hotel room where they drink and continue to do cocaine. Drunk and high, the three accidentally rip Beckys bridal gown, and Katie gets a nosebleed and stains it with her blood.Regan contacts a friend who owns a bridal store, who reluctantly agrees to open the store for them in the middle of the night.

67,68,Bad Moms,2016,/wiki/Bad_Moms,"Amy Mitchell (Mila Kunis) is a married woman in the Chicago suburbs with two children, Jane (Oona Laurence) and Dylan (Emjay Anthony), who feels overworked and overcommitted. She works as a sales rep for a ""hip"" coffee company, prepares healthful, hand-packed lunches for her children, does most of their homework, goes to all of their extracurricular activities, and is active in her schools PTA, run by the domineering Gwendolyn James (Christina Applegate) and her cronies, Stacy (Jada Pinkett Smith) and Vicky (Annie Mumolo). When she catches her husband Mike (David Walton) cheating on her with a camgirl, Amy kicks him out and attempts to keep everything together.After a particularly stressful day, Amy publicly quits the PTA in response to Gwendolyns overzealous bake sale plans. At a nearby bar, Amy meets Carla (Kathryn Hahn), a laid-back, sexually active single mom, and Kiki (Kristen Bell), a stay-at-home mom of four who adores Amys dissent from Gwendolyn. Amy and Carla are irritated to discover that Kikis husband is domineering and expects her to take care of all the kids and the house with no assistance whatsoever, while Amy and Kiki are disturbed at Carlas very hands-off approach to parenting. The trio embark on an all-night bender that inspires Amy to loosen up with her kids: she takes them for rides in Mikes classic car, gets them lunch from Arbys, forces Dylan to fend for himself to prevent him from being lazy and entitled, and takes the overachieving and constantly stressed Jane for a spa day. Amy herself decides to start dating but finds herself inexperienced due to her early marriage and motherhood. She ultimately ends up striking a connection with Jessie (Jay Hernandez), a handsome widower at the school whos had a crush on her.After Amy brings store-bought donut holes to the bake sale, she draws the ire of Gwendolyn, who uses her PTA authority to get Jane benched from the soccer team. Amy is angered, and decides to run for PTA president in opposition to Gwendolyn. A meet-and-greet at Amys home draws only one visitor, who informs them that Gwendolyn has launched a rival party at her own house, catered by Martha Stewart. In spite of this, the other moms, and Martha, swiftly abandon Gwendolyns party when it becomes clear that she intends to lecture them all evening, leading to a successful party at Amys house.Gwendolyn responds by putting drugs in Janes locker, framing her, which gets her kicked out of all extracurricular activities. Jane and Dylan both go to stay with Mike (who has agreed to an amicable divorce) in response to what they see as Amys failure as a mom. Amy loses her job because her boss refuses to understand her reasons for taking time off.A despondent Amy stays home during the PTA election but is roused into action by Carla and Kiki, who finally stands up to her husband and orders him to deal with everything alone until the meeting is over. At the event, Amy gives an inspiring speech about how all the moms are overworked and that they need to take time off, do fewer and less stressful events, and most importantly, allow themselves to make mistakes. Amy wins by a landslide and eventually winds up comforting a devastated Gwendolyn, who reveals that her life is not perfect like she claims it is and that being in charge of the PTA was her only way to take her anger out on the problems she is facing.Some weeks later, Amys approach has led to positive changes: Jane has been reinstated to the soccer team and is stressing out less, Dylan is actually applying himself, Kiki makes her husband help out with taking care of their kids, Carla is more responsible and hands-on, and all of the other moms, including Stacy and Vicky, are feeling more energized. Amy herself has gotten her job back with much better compensation after her boss sees how much he had taken her for granted, and she continues to see Jessie.

She is foul-mouthed and greedy, drinks alcohol heavily, smokes marijuana, and shows movies while sleeping through class. She plans to quit teaching and marry her wealthy fiancé Mark, but resumes her job when he dumps her after learning she is only after his money. Elizabeth tries to win over substitute teacher Scott Delacorte, who is also wealthy because his family runs a watch company. Amy Squirrel, a dedicated and enthusiastic colleague, also pursues Scott while the schools gym teacher, Russell Gettis, makes it clear that he is interested in Elizabeth romantically, and she is not interested in him because he is a gym teacher.Elizabeth plans to get surgery to enlarge her breasts, and becomes all the more motivated to do so once she learns Scotts ex-girlfriend had large breasts, but she cannot afford $9,300 for the procedure. She feels worse when Scott admits that he is interested in Amy, and that he only likes Elizabeth as a friend. Elizabeth attempts to raise money for the surgery by participating in her 7th grade class car wash in provocative clothing and by manipulating parents to give her money for more school supplies and tutoring, but her efforts are not enough. Amy, acting on the growing resentment between them due to Elizabeth pursuing Scott and ignoring school rules, attempts to warn the principal about Elizabeths embezzlement scheme, but he dismisses her claims as groundless.Elizabeth later learns from her best friend, Lynn Davies, that the teacher of the class with the highest state test scores will receive a $5,700 bonus. With this knowledge, Elizabeth decides to change her style of teaching, forcing the class to intensely read and study To Kill a Mockingbird for the upcoming test. However, the change is too late and insufficient. The students receive low scores on their quizzes, frustrating her even more. Meanwhile, she befriends Russell the gym teacher as Amy and Scott start dating. Desperate to pay off the procedure for her breast surgery, Elizabeth steals the state test answers by disguising herself as a journalist and seducing Carl Halabi, a state official who is in charge of creating and distributing the exams. Elizabeth gets Carl drunk and convinces him to take her to his office to have sex, but she spikes his drink and steals a copy of the answers. A month later, Elizabeths class aces the test and she wins the bonus, giving her the funds needed to get her breasts enlarged.When Elizabeth learns that Amy and Scott are chaperoning an upcoming field trip, she smears an apple with poison ivy and leaves it for Amy, who ends up with her face breaking out in blisters, so she cannot go. On the trip, Elizabeth seduces Scott. They dry hump and Elizabeth secretly calls Amy using Scotts phone leaving a message recording all the action, ensuring she knows about the affair. Elizabeth ultimately finds Scott unsatisfying. On a field trip, her student Garrett is embarrassed and ridiculed by his classmates after publicly confessing his unrequited love for a classmate named Chase. Elizabeth consoles him afterwards and tells him how she is too superficial to return his interest, which causes Elizabeth to reflect on her own superficial ways. To stop the other students from making fun of Garrett, she helps by giving him her bra and telling everyone she caught a student from another school giving him a handjob.Left behind at the school, Amy switches Elizabeths desk with her own to trick the janitor into unlocking Elizabeths sealed drawer. Amy finds Elizabeths journalist disguise and the practice test, which leads her to suspect Elizabeth cheated on the state exam. Amy informs the principal and gets Carl to testify against her. However, Elizabeth took embarrassing photos of Carl while he was drugged and, with the help of her roommate, Kirk, uses them to blackmail him to say she is innocent. Having failed to expose Elizabeths cheating, Amy accuses her of drug use, based on a tip from a student. When the police arrive and bring their sniffer dog to search the school, they find Elizabeths mini liquor bottles, marijuana and OxyContin pills in Amys classroom, in a secret compartment in Elizabeths desk which Elizabeth helpfully points out to the police. At the end of the school year, Amy is moved to another school in the county by the superintendent. Scott asks Elizabeth to start over, wanting a relationship with her, but Elizabeth rejects him to be with Russell, who she has learned she has a lot in common with.When the new school year starts, Elizabeth has not gotten the breast enlargement after all, because she feels that she looks fine the way she is. She also has a new position as the schools guidance counselor.",20000000,"[{""id"": 35, ""name"": ""Comedy""}]",http://www.areyouabadteacher.com/,52449,"[{""id"": 1517, ""name"": ""classroom""}, {""id"": 10508, ""name"": ""teacher""}, {""id"": 10873, ""name"": ""school""}, {""id"": 210605, ""name"": ""workplace humor""}]",en,"A lazy, incompetent middle school teacher who hates her job and her students is forced to return to her job to make enough money for a boob job after her rich fiancé dumps her.",28.497242,"[{""name"": ""Columbia Pictures"", ""id"": 5}, {""name"": ""Mosaic Media Group"", ""id"": 748}]","[{""iso_3166_1"": ""US"", ""name"": ""United States of America""}]",5/16/2011,216197492,92,"[{""iso_639_1"": ""en"", ""name"": ""English""}]",Released,She doesn't give an F.,Bad Teacher,5.4,1584,0.221585453,0.076197386,0.04502368,0.15885663,-0.113832951,0.031173706,0.145388067,0.096798241,10.8098746

Wayne learns that Russian weapon trafficker Anatoli Knyazev has been contacting LexCorp mogul Lex Luthor.

75,76,Battle: Los Angeles,2011,/wiki/Battle:_Los_Angeles,"On August 12, 2011, large masses thought to be meteors land in the oceans near major coastal cities. The objects are discovered to be spacecraft containing hostile extraterrestrial life. As Los Angeles is being evacuated, Marines from Camp Pendleton arrive, including Staff Sergeant Michael Nantz, an Iraq War veteran. Nantz was to begin retirement, but because of the attack, he is made the acting platoon sergeant for 1st Platoon, Echo Company, of the 2nd Battalion 5th Marines.Under the command of 2nd Lieutenant William Martinez, the platoon arrives at Santa Monica Airport, now a Forward Operating Base. The alien ground forces have no apparent air support, so the Air Force prepares to carpet bomb the Santa Monica area, and the platoon is tasked with rescuing civilians from an LAPD station in West Los Angeles before the bombing in three hours. As they advance through LA, they are ambushed and suffer multiple casualties.  Nantz takes two survivors, Imlay and Harris, to look for Lenihan, who is missing from the group after having been wounded. After fighting off an alien, they regroup and team up with a group of Army National Guard soldiers from the 40th Infantry Division, and an Air Force intelligence Tech. Sergeant, Elena Santos. At the police station, the platoon finds five civilians: veterinarian Michele, children Hector Rincon, Kirsten, Amy, and Hectors father Joe. A helicopter soon arrives to evacuate the wounded Marines, but fails to take civilians because of weight restrictions. During takeoff, it is destroyed by alien air forces, killing Grayston, Guerrero, Lenihan and Simmons.The Marines commandeer an abandoned town bus for evacuation. With the help of Michele and Santos, they also vivisect a wounded extraterrestrial and find a vulnerable spot in its abdomen, as well as realizing that the UFO aircraft are drones which track down victims using their radio transmissions. Santos reveals that her mission was to locate the aliens central command center, believing that its destruction would deactivate the drones. On the I-10 freeway, their bus comes under attack, as well as finding the freeways off-ramp destroyed. The Marines release their civilians from the freeway by rappelling them. In the ensuing battle, Marines Stavrou and Mottola and the remainder of the Army National Guard soldiers are killed, while both Joe (who grabs a rifle and attacks one of the aliens) and Lieutenant Martinez are wounded. Martinez detonates explosives inside the bus, sacrificing himself to kill the aliens, leaving Nantz in command. Surviving troopers Nantz, Santos, Imlay, Kerns, Lockett, Harris, Adukwu and the civilians escape the bombing zone. A news report speculates that the aliens are seeking Earths water for fuel while attempting to colonize the planet and eradicate humans. The team prepares for the bombing, but nothing happens. Returning to the FOB, the Marines find it destroyed and that the military is retreating from LA. The Marines plan to escort the civilians to an alternate extraction point. Joe finally dies from his wounds, and Nantz comforts Joes son Hector. Lockett confronts Nantz over his brother, Cpl Dwayne G. Lockett and the others who were killed during Nantzs last tour. They come to peace when Nantz explains that he continues to think of them, and recites each persons name, rank and serial number. Nantz then says that the surviving Marines deserve to move forward united to honor their fallen comrades, including Joe for his bravery. They reach the extraction point and evacuate by helicopter.In mid-air, the chopper experiences a brief loss of power. Nantz theorizes that they are hovering over a location occupied by the alien command center as it relays radio energy to its drones. He decides to reconnoiter the area alone, but Nantzs team insists on accompanying him. Searching underground, the Marines confirm the presence of a large alien vessel. Kerns radios in to request missiles, which Nantz manually directs using a laser designator while the others defend his position. Despite Kerns being killed when a Drone homes in on his radio signals, the Marines succeed in routing a missile to the command module, which is destroyed.

Kyle bullies Kendra Hilferty (Mary-Kate Olsen), not knowing she is a witch; she transforms him into a hairless, scarred, heavily-tattooed shell of his former self. If Kyle does not find someone who loves him by the next spring he will stay altered permanently. Kyle is taken to live in a private house with their maid Zola Davies (LisaGay Hamilton) and the blind tutor Will (Neil Patrick Harris). Both are comforts to Kyle when his father, unable to deal with his transformation, has abandoned him.As spring nears, Kyle finds himself infatuated with Lindy Taylor (Vanessa Hudgens), a former classmate he had avoided. He rescues her drug-addicted father from two dealers, shooting one; the other vows to kill Lindy. Kyle persuades Lindys father to allow her to move in with him. At first, Kyle uses a false identity, refuses to see Lindy, and hides from her, which angers her to the point that she stops speaking to him. Kyle eventually reveals his face and the two begin to warm up to each other. Kyle writes a letter professing his love for Lindy but does not give it to her for fear of rejection. He visits Kendra to plead for more time; she refuses, but agrees to restore Wills vision and grant green cards to Zolas three children in Jamaica if he gets Lindy to fall in love with him.The surviving drug dealer lands in jail. Kyle and Lindy visit Lindys hospitalized father. He gives her the letter but regrets it when she tells him she considers him a good friend. Lindy calls him after reading the letter, but a heartbroken Kyle does not answer the phone. Persuaded by Will and Zola, Kyle goes to meet Lindy one last time before she leaves on a school trip to Machu Picchu. Kyle tells her to go, but as she leaves, Lindy tells him that she loves him, breaking the curse. Kyles former self is restored but Lindy does not recognize him and tries to call Hunter but Kyles phone rings instead. When Lindy realizes what happened, the two share a passionate kiss on the side of the street.After the curse is lifted Will wakes up with the ability to see, and Zola receives the green cards. Kendra approaches Rob Kingsons office as a new intern, implying that she will test Rob like she did Kyle.There was an alternate ending that was filmed where Lindy gets kidnapped by the drug dealer and in the process Kyle gets shot.

The children in school are being taught by Miss Bathsheba about nature and the release of prehistoric aurochs from the melting ice caps. At home, Hushpuppy fends for herself while her father is missing. When he returns, he is wearing a hospital gown and bracelet. They argue, and when Hushpuppy returns to her house, she deliberately sets it on fire. A chase ensues between the two, and she ends up getting slapped by Wink. When she retaliates by punching him in the chest, Wink collapses. Hushpuppy, realizing the damage she has caused, runs for help only to find her father missing when she returns.Meanwhile, in the Arctic, the frozen aurochs in an ice shelf start drifting into the ocean.Many of the Bathtub residents flee an approaching storm. Wink reappears, staggering along the side of the road; he finds Hushpuppy and takes her home to start barricading before the storm hits. In an effort to make his daughter feel better, Wink attempts to scare off the storm by firing a rifle at the clouds. The next day, the two tour the devastation and connect with surviving residents.The Bathtub residents celebrate the end of the storm and make plans to rebuild their community, but the environment is damaged because the salt water surge from the storm has contaminated the fresh water supply. Wink hatches a plan to drain the water away by destroying the levee. He and a small group of friends plant dynamite and blow a hole in the wall using an alligator gar, and the water recedes. Authorities arrive and enforce a mandatory evacuation order, removing the residents of the Bathtub to an emergency shelter. Wink receives surgery, but it is too late to restore his health. At the first opportunity, the evacuees escape back to their homes.Aware of her fathers condition, Hushpuppy searches for her absent mother. She and her friends swim to a boat, which takes them to a floating bar known as the Elysian Fields. Hushpuppy meets a cook who may be her mother, though the woman doesnt recognize her. The cook says that the girl can stay with her if she wants, but Hushpuppy says she needs to go home. Hushpuppy and her friends return home where she confronts the aurochs. As the aurochs leave, Hushpuppy returns home. She says her last goodbyes to the dying Wink, listening to his last heartbeat.

81,82,Before Sunset,2013,/wiki/Before_Sunset,"Nine years before, Jesse and Céline had met and had a brief encounter in Vienna. Jesses new novel, This Time, was inspired by that night, and becomes a bestseller. He does a book tour in Europe, including Paris. He does a reading at the noted bookstore, Shakespeare and Company. Flashbacks express elements of his time with Céline in Vienna. Three journalists attend the reading to interview Jesse: one is convinced the books main characters meet again, another that they do not, and a third who wants them to but is doubtful that will occur. As Jesse speaks with the audience, his eyes wander and he sees Céline there, smiling at him.After the presentation, the bookstore manager reminds Jesse of his need to leave for the airport in about an hour for his plane. Céline and Jesses time together is again constrained. They make the best of it, and their conversations become deeply personal. They begin with themes of work and politics and, with increasing passion, approach their earlier feelings for each other.They touch on their failure to have met as planned six months after their first encounter. Jesse returned to Vienna but Céline did not, because her grandmother had died suddenly. Since the pair had never exchanged phone numbers, they had no way to contact each other at the time.Their talk reveals how their lives have changed during the nine years they spent apart. Jesse, now a writer, is married and has a son. Céline has become an advocate for the environment, and has a photojournalist boyfriend. They each express some dissatisfaction with their lives.They talk as they walk in Paris, with scenes showing a café, garden, bateau mouche, and Jesses hired car. Their former feelings are slowly rekindled, as their one night together looms large in memory, unmarred by ordinary trials. Jesse says his book was inspired by his hope of seeing Céline again. She says that it brought back painful memories. They begin to approach each other tentatively but pull back.In the concluding scene, Céline and Jesse arrive at her apartment. Jesse persuades her to play a waltz on her guitar. Her song is about their earlier brief encounter. Jesse puts a Nina Simone CD on the stereo system.

83,84,Ben-Hur,2016,/wiki/Ben-Hur_(2016_film),"A Jewish nobleman, Judah Ben-Hur, and his adopted Roman brother Messala are best friends despite their different origins. Messala enlists in the Roman army and fights in the Roman Empires wars in Germany. Ben-Hur also develops feelings for the family slave Esther although their different station in life compels him not to pursue her. But when her father Simonides seeks to marry her off to a Roman, Ben-Hur declares his love for her and takes her as his wife. Three years later, Messala returns as a decorated Roman officer. His return coincides with a rising insurrection by the Zealots, Jews who are opposed to the oppressive nature of Roman rule. Ben-Hur treats and shelters a young Zealot youth named Dismas. Messala reunites with Ben-Hur and attempts to convince his adoptive brother to serve as an informant. Following a reunion dinner with Ben-Hur and his family, Messala informs them that a new Roman governor Pontius Pilate will be taking residence in Jerusalem.Days later, Pontius Pilate marches into Jerusalem with Ben-Hur and his family watching from a balcony. Dismas attempts to assassinate Pilate and in retaliation, the Romans storm Ben-Hurs household and arrest him and his family. Rather than betray a fellow Jew, Ben-Hur takes responsibility for the assassination attempt. His mother and sister are sentenced to be crucified. Ben-Hur and Messala fall out with each other. While being led to the prison galley, Ben-Hur encounters Jesus, who fetches him some water. Ben-Hur endures five years of slavery as a rower aboard a Roman prison galley under the command of Quintus Arius. During a naval battle against Greek rebels in the Ionian Sea, Ben-Hurs galley is boarded but collides with another ship and is destroyed as Ben-Hur manages to cling to a floating mast. He is washed ashore and is found by Sheik Ilderim, who recognizes him as an escaped slave. Ben-Hur manages to convince Ilderim not to hand him over to the Romans by treating one of the Nubians racing horses. After Ben-Hur develops a bond with the four racing horses, a grateful Ilderim then trains Ben-Hur to be a chariot racer.Ben-Hur and Sheik Ilderim later travel to Jerusalem to take part in a grand chariot race at the newly built Roman circus. Jesus preaching ministry draws the attention of governor Pilate and Messala, who is now the commander of the Roman garrison and a champion chariot racer. While visiting Jerusalem, Ben-Hur encounters Esther, who has become a follower of Jesus and is involved in charity work. Esther tells Ben-Hur that his mother and sister are dead, and despite their reunion, the two are kept emotionally apart due to her new cause, which is contrary to his insistence on seeking revenge against Messala.Ben-Hur later confronts Messala alone in their former home but is forced to flee when Roman soldiers turn up. After the Romans execute twenty Jews in reprisal, Esther completely falls out with Ben-Hur. Sheik Ilderim instructs Ben-Hur in chariot racing techniques. Later,  Ben-Hur encounters a former Roman soldier named Druses, who informs him that his mother Naomi and sister Tirzah are still alive. However, their reunion is soured when Ben-Hur discovers his mother and sister have leprosy, the former also appearing to have lost her memory.Sheik Ilderim bribes Pilate into allowing Ben-Hur to compete by proposing a high wager. Esther tries to convince Messala not to race Ben-Hur, but he is adamant that he will win. On the day of the race, Ben-Hur follows Ilderims instructions to hold back from the race until the final laps. Using dirty tactics, Messala manages to knock out the other competing charioteers. Following a brutal and grueling race, Ben-Hur wins the race. Messala survives but is badly wounded and loses a leg. Ben-Hurs victory emboldens the Jewish spectators and yields dividends for Ilderim.Despite his victory, Ben-Hur is despondent about his family and his former friend Messala. Later, Esther witnesses the arrest of Jesus in the Garden of Gethsemane. Ben-Hur and Esther witness a bruised and beaten Jesus being forced to carry his cross through the streets. Mirroring his first encounter with Jesus, Ben-Hur tries to offer Jesus water but is beaten by a Roman soldier. Following Jesus crucifixion, a rainstorm occurs. Naomi and Tirzah are miraculously healed by rainwater containing the blood of Jesus, and Sheik Ilderim pays a ransom to set them free. Despite his anger, Messala finds the strength to forgive Ben-Hur and is reconciled with him and his family.

87,88,Big Hero 6,2014,/wiki/Big_Hero_6_(film),"Hiro Hamada is a 14-year-old robotics genius living in the futuristic city of San Fransokyo who spends much of his free time participating in illegal robot fights. To redirect Hiro, his older brother Tadashi takes him to the research lab at the San Fransokyo Institute of Technology, where Hiro meets Tadashis friends, GoGo, Wasabi, Honey Lemon, and Fred. Hiro also meets Professor Robert Callaghan, the head of the universitys robotics program. Amazed, Hiro decides to apply to the university.To enroll, he signs up for the schools science fair and presents his project: microbots, swarms of tiny robots that can link together in any arrangement imaginable using a neurocranial transmitter. At the fair, Hiro declines an offer from Alistair Krei, CEO of Krei Tech, to market the microbots, and Callaghan accepts him into the school. At the end of the day, a fire breaks out among the exhibits and Tadashi rushes in to save Callaghan, the only person left inside. The building explodes moments later, killing Tadashi.Weeks later, a depressed Hiro, in mourning for Callaghans and Tadashis death, inadvertently activates Baymax, the inflatable healthcare robot that Tadashi created; the two find Hiros only remaining microbot and follow it to an abandoned warehouse. There they discover that someone has been mass-producing the microbots, and are attacked by a man wearing a Kabuki mask who is controlling them. After they escape, Hiro equips Baymax with armor and a battle chip containing various karate moves, and they track the masked man to the docks. GoGo, Wasabi, Honey Lemon, and Fred arrive, responding to a call from Baymax, and the masked man chases the group. The six escape to Freds mansion, where they decide to form a high-tech superhero team to combat the villain.The group tracks the masked man, whom they suspect to be Krei, to an abandoned Krei Tech laboratory which was used for teleportation research until a test pilot was lost in an accident. The masked man attacks, but the group subdues him and knocks off his mask – revealing him to be Callaghan, who had stolen and used Hiros microbots to shield himself from the explosion, leaving Tadashi to die. Enraged, Hiro removes Baymaxs healthcare chip, leaving only the battle chip, and orders him to kill Callaghan. Honey reinstalls the healthcare chip at the last second, preventing Baymax from carrying out the kill order. Callaghan escapes, and Hiro leaves with Baymax, intent on avenging Tadashi.Back home, Hiro tries to remove the healthcare chip again, but Baymax stops him and states that vengeance is not what Tadashi would have wanted. To calm him down, Baymax shows Hiro videos of Tadashi running numerous tests during Baymaxs development as a demonstration of Tadashis benevolence and legacy. Hiro remorsefully apologizes to his friends, who reassure him they will catch Callaghan the right way.Video footage from the laboratory accident reveals that the lost test pilot was Callaghans daughter Abigail, and that Callaghan is seeking revenge on Krei. Callaghan interrupts Krei at a public event and attempts to destroy his headquarters using Kreis teleportation portal. After a lengthy battle, the team deprives Callaghan of his microbots and the mask, saving Krei, but the portal remains active. Baymax detects Abigail inside, alive but in hyper-sleep, and leaps into the portal with Hiro to rescue her. They find Abigails pod, but on the way back out, Baymax is struck by debris, damaging his armor and disabling his thrusters. With no other option Baymax activates his armors rocket fist, and asks Hiro to say he is satisfied with his care, to the shock of Hiro, but Baymax convinces him to do it, saying he will always be with him. Hiro agrees, and Baymax fires his rocket fist, propelling Hiro and Abigail back through the portal before it closes. Callaghan is arrested while Abigail is taken to the hospital.Some time later, Hiro discovers Baymaxs health care chip clenched in the rocket fist. He rebuilds Baymaxs body, and the six friends continue their exploits throughout the city.

Jackson), has been accepted to attend Duke University in Durham, North Carolina. However, Trent is uninterested and instead wants Malcolm to sign a recording contract for him since he is underage. When Malcolm refuses, Trents best friends encourage him to ambush Malcolm on the job in order to obtain the signature.Malcolm, in an attempt to capture Russian gang member Chirkoff (Tony Curran), uses an informant named Canetti to deliver a flash drive to the gang, while Trent attempts to ambush Malcolm on the job. Canetti (Max Casella) reveals that the flash drive is empty and a duplicate is hidden with a friend at the Georgia Girls School for the Arts.During the exchange, Canettis cover is blown and he is killed, which Trent witnesses. Malcolm eventually rescues Trent and they escape, but since Trents car was left at the scene Malcolm knows the gang members will be able to track them down so Malcolm and Trent are forced to hide undercover. Malcolm once again becomes Sherrys grandmother, Big Momma, and also disguises Trent as an obese girl named ""Charmaine"", Big Mommas great-niece. Big Momma takes a job as a house mother at the Georgia Girls School for the Arts, while Charmaine is enrolled as a student.Surrounded by attractive young women, Trent nearly blows his cover, but manages to befriend a girl named Haley Robinson (Jessica Lucas). The headmistress announces that a historic music box has been stolen from the library, and Malcolm deduces that this music box contains the flash drive. While scoping out the library, Big Momma encounters security guard Kurtis Kool, who attempts to woo her while giving a tour. Seeing a picture of Kurtis with Canetti, Malcolm realizes that he is the friend, and tries to find out more about the music box.Meanwhile, the gang members approach Trents best friends, posing as record producers, and encourage them to notify them of Trents whereabouts. Charmaine sets up a date between Haley and himself, though she doubts she will be interested in the seemingly egotistical ""Prodi-G,"" Trents hip-hop alias. Trent reverts to his true self and the date goes well, but an encounter with Trents best friends causes the gang members to tail them.Trent helps Haley perfect her musical performance for the upcoming ""Showcase"" event, turning it into a duet, and the two exchange a kiss at the end of the date, while Haley encourages Trent to pursue college. Before the gang members can capture Trent, he changes into his Charmaine disguise, throwing them off. Learning of an exchange between two students and Kurtis Kool, Big Momma attempts to flirt with Kurtis in order to apprehend him for stealing the music box, but the secret exchange ends up being the stolen gamecock from the Ignatius Boys School.During this encounter, Malcolm reveals his true identity to Kurtis. After gaining the favor of several students by offering sage advice and comfort to them, Big Momma finally learns the music box was actually stolen by Haley as a hazing to become a full pledged member of the ""Divas"", a group of top artists in the school. As she is about to perform her duet, Malcolm forces Trent to retain his Charmaine disguise, and he attempts to perform the duet with Haley as Charmaine, only to break disguise and ruin the performance.

When Langston arrives in the city, he just misses his grandparents and, shortly after, is robbed of his possessions. Entering a hotel to get directions to his grandparents place, Langston is accused of trying to take a wallet and is quickly taken in by the police.  While in the holding cell, he meets a man who makes fun of him for stealing wallets. Shortly after, Langston is reunited with his grandfather, the Reverend Cobbs, who takes him to his home.Langston is taken aback by the comfortable home his grandparents live in and by the fact that they know nothing about him and his mother Naima. In an attempt to bond with Langston, the Reverend shows him a pocket watch with a personalized inscription from Martin Luther King, Jr.. Langston pockets the watch that night and, in the morning, tries to pawn it off. However, the pawnshop owner is a friend of his grandfather and refuses to buy it, telling Langston to treasure the pocket watch and return it to his grandfather. Outside the pawnbrokers shop, Langston meets the man he met in the holding cell. The man is passing out flyers for the pawnbroker and offers to procure for him whatever he wants. Langston tries to talk to his grandmother, Aretha, about why his mother left. She denies that he was the cause of the rift but says that his father was the reason behind their estrangement. Before leaving for church, Langston finds the man from the jail cell, the same man from the corner of the pawn shop, and asks him for a gun. The man then tells Langston to meet him at the same spot later at night.Despite his reluctance to attend church, Aretha and the Reverend pressure him to attend church as they are performing Langston Hughes Black Nativity play. Langston sees the man from the pawn shop & Maria and the young man from an earlier scene. While there, Langston falls asleep and dreams that he is a part of the nativity, with Maria, a young pregnant woman he met earlier, playing the part of the virgin Mary. Waking up, Langston leaves the church to meet with the man he met in the jail cell. The man shows him the gun he wanted and Langston takes it from him and then tries to hold him up, asking him to give him a ring he spotted earlier in the display case and all the cash in the pawnbrokers cash register. Instead, the man quotes A Dream Deferred to him and reveals that he is Langstons father, Tyson. A passing police officer spots the two and enters, but Langstons father convinces him that they were only having an argument and Langston was only trying to convince him to go to church with him. The police officer then drives them to the church where they meet Naima.Inside the church with his father and mother, Langston asks his grandfather what happened between his parents. The Reverend confesses that he gave Tyson five thousand dollars to leave Naima and Langston, hoping that Naima would return to her parents. Instead, Naima found out what her father had done and left with Langston, cutting off both Tyson and her parents. Naima tries to leave with Langston, but he urges her to forgive her parents.

97,98,Blackhat,2015,/wiki/Blackhat_(film),"At a nuclear plant in Chai Wan, Hong Kong, a hacker causes the coolant pumps to overheat and explode. Not long after in Chicago, the Mercantile Trade Exchange gets hacked, causing soy futures to rise. The Chinese government and the FBI determine that the hack was caused by a remote access tool (RAT). An army officer in Chinas Peoples Liberation Army (PLA) cyber warfare unit, Captain Chen Dawai (Leehom Wang), is tasked to find the people responsible for the attacks, and enlists the aid of his sister Chen Lien (Tang Wei), a hacking engineer. He meets with FBI Special Agent Carol Barrett (Viola Davis) in Los Angeles and reveals the code in the RAT was written by himself and Nicholas Hathaway (Chris Hemsworth), his brilliant college roommate, in their school days at MIT, years before Hathaway was sent to prison for an unrelated hack. Dawai asks that the FBI arrange for Hathaway to be released from prison, where he is serving a sentence for computer crimes. Hathaway is offered a temporary release in exchange for his services.  He negotiates a deal with the U.S. government to have his prison sentence commuted as time served if his assistance aids in the apprehension of the hacker. However, he must wear an ankle bracelet and be monitored by a Deputy U.S. Marshal named Jessup (Holt McCallany).Hathaway identifies the criminal who aided the hacker in his penetration of the Exchanges computer servers and develops a romantic relationship with Lien. Clues uncovered by Captain Chen and Special Agent Barrett next lead the team to Hong Kong where the team works with Police Inspector Alex Trang (Andy On). Hathaway manipulates the update system on the Marshals phone GPS that tracks his location, so he can follow his own lead and arranges a meet with the hackers partner to a restaurant. While they are waiting, he tells Lien about his past, but the hackers partner never shows. Hathaway discovers a camera watching them and messages the hacker on the restaurants computer that he is on his trail now. A gang arrives, but Hathaway defeats them as if it were a prison fight. Meanwhile, the team traces the stock trade money to a known paramilitary operative named Elias Kassar (Ritchie Coster). Hathaway, Jessup, Chen, and Trang, along with a Special Duties Unit team, raid Kassars hideout. A shootout ensues and Trang as well as a number of SDU officers are killed as Kassars men are armed with superior firepower and explosives, allowing them to escape by boat.Meanwhile, the nuclear plant has stabilized enough to retrieve a data drive from the control room but it is corrupted. The NSAs Black Widow software has the power to repair the data, but the U.S. does not want the Chinese using it. Hathaway goes rogue and successfully hacks into the NSA to use Black Widow, discovering that the hackers server is based in Jakarta. Lien finds out the hacker has been buying high-resolution satellite photos of a site near Seri Manjung, Malaysia.Hathaways hack into the NSA does not go unnoticed and the U.S. government, NSA and FBI demand his return to prison. Dawais superiors advise him to proceed the investigation without Hathaway. Outside, one of Kassars men secretly plants a tracking device on Dawais car. Dawai, Lien and Hathaway manage to elude them but Hathaway argues with Lien about the danger of them staying together, when they are ambushed by Kassar and his men. Dawai is killed as are Barrett and Jessup, who arrive on the scene. Lien and Hathaway barely escape into the subway. Lien uses her connections to acquire a plane to go after Kassar.Mourning Dawais death, Hathaway and Lien travel to Malaysia out of revenge to figure out the hackers goal. After discovering a set of tin mines, Hathaway realizes that the hackers attack at the nuclear plant was merely a test for a later plan to sabotage a large dam with huge spill ways to destroy several major tin mines that are down stream in Malaysia, allowing the hacker to make a fortune trading tin futures. The two travel to Jakarta and hack into the banks computer to successfully drain the hackers bank accounts, forcing the hacker, Sadak (Yorick van Wageningen), to respond. Sadak and Hathaway agree to become partners. Hathaway knows that the meeting will be a trap and arms himself with makeshift weapons and body armor, using his prison knowledge. He conceals the weapons under a loose fitting jacket.Hathaway insists Sadak and Kassar come alone but they bring their henchmen. Lien spots them and alerts Hathaway, who orders them to a new location at nightfall, a crowded parade in a large park. Hathaway trails Sadak and Kassar from behind. Kassar draws a machine pistol on Hathaway as he approaches. As Kassar is frisking Hathaway, he is overpowered and fatally stabbed with a screwdriver. Two of Sadaks men catch up and a firefight ensues, wounding Hathaway despite the armor, who manages to kill both men with the pistol. Hathaway is stabbed by Sadak, but manages to kill him.

Sam is shocked but glad. As the killing has gone unreported on the news, Dwight surmises that the Clelands have decided to seek revenge without police involvement. Sam flees her home with her daughters and Dwight waits in the house for the Clelands attack. Wades two brothers arrive in the car Dwight left outside the club. Dwight escapes the attackers and runs over one of the Clelands, Teddy, in his car; he places the unconscious Teddy in the trunk. Before Dwight drives away, Teddys brother Carl shoots him in the thigh with a crossbow.After attempting surgery on himself, Dwight has the wound treated at a hospital and returns to Sams house to clean up the mess. He tracks down an old high school friend, Ben, who lends him a rifle. On Bens land, Dwight interrogates Teddy at gunpoint. Teddy tells him that Wade was not his parents killer; it was Wades now-deceased father, in revenge for Dwights father having an affair with Wade Sr.s wife. His mothers death was unfortunate; she just happened to be in the car when Wade Sr. ambushed it. Wade Jr. took the blame as his father was dying from cancer and the family did not want him to die in prison. Teddy wrestles Dwights rifle from him, but Ben shoots him dead from a concealed position. To keep Ben from further involvement, Dwight removes the battery from Bens car.Dwight goes to the Cleland house and finds it empty. He searches it for guns, dumps them in a lake, and waits to ambush the Clelands. He leaves a message on the house answering machine asking them to leave Sam out of the dispute. Carl, his older sister, Kris, and their cousin, Hope, return and listen to Dwights message; when it becomes clear that the Clelands intend to kill Sam, Dwight shoots and kills Carl. He then holds the women at gunpoint while explaining his dilemma about whether to kill the family members. William enters through another door and shoots Dwight with both barrels of a shotgun. Dwight, severely wounded, asks William to leave with his car and tells him what Teddy told him: they are half-brothers. After William leaves, Hope attempts to attack Dwight; Kris reaches for a TEC-9 hidden under a recliner and fires at Dwight, but she misses and instead kills Hope. Dwights next shot mortally wounds Kris, but she kills him before she dies.

103,104,Brave,2012,/wiki/Brave_(2012_film),"In Medieval Scotland, Princess Merida of the clan Dunbroch is given a bow and arrow by her father, King Fergus, for her sixth birthday to the dismay of her mother, Queen Elinor. While venturing into the woods to fetch a stray arrow, Merida encounters a will-o-the-wisp. Soon afterward, Mordu, a huge demon bear, attacks the family. Merida flees on horseback with Elinor, while Fergus and his men fend off Mordu, though the fight costs him one of his legs.Ten years later, Merida discovers that to her dismay, she is to be betrothed to the son of one of her fathers allies. Reminding Merida of a legend of a prince whose pride and refusal to follow his fathers wishes destroyed his kingdom, Elinor explains that failure to consent to the betrothal could harm Dunbroch.The allied clan chieftains and their first-born sons arrive to compete in the Highland games for Meridas hand in marriage. Merida twists the rules, announcing that as her own clans firstborn she is eligible to compete for her own hand. She easily bests her suitors in an archery contest, shaming the other clans. Later, she and Elinor argue and Merida leaves. After following the wisps to the hut of an elderly witch, Merida bargains with her for a spell to change her fate.When Merida gives the spell, in the form of a cake, to Elinor, it causes Elinor to transform into a bear, unable to speak but still retaining most of her human consciousness. Merida returns to the witchs cottage with Elinor, only to find it deserted, and discovers a message from the witch: unless Merida is able to ""mend the bond torn by pride"" before the second sunrise, the spell will become permanent. Merida and Elinor are led by the wisps to ancient ruins, where they encounter Mordu. Realizing that Mordu was the prince in the legend, Merida vows that she will not let the same thing happen to her mother, and concludes she needs to repair the family tapestry she damaged during their argument.They return to the castle to find the clans on the verge of war. Having learned from her experience with her mother, Merida intends to declare herself ready to choose a suitor as tradition demands, but with nonverbal encouragement from Elinor, instead insists that the first-borns should be allowed to marry in their own time to whomever they choose. The clans agree, breaking tradition but renewing and strengthening their alliance.Merida sneaks into the tapestry room with Elinor. Elinor, who is losing her humanity, attacks Fergus, but suddenly regains her composure and flees the castle. Mistaking the queen for Mordu and unwilling to listen to Merida, Fergus pursues the bear with the other clans, locking Merida in the castle. With the help of her younger triplet brothers, who also ate the cake and have been transformed into bear cubs, Merida escapes and repairs the tapestry while riding after her father. Fergus and the clans capture Elinor, but Merida intervenes and stops her father before Mordu arrives. Mordu batters the clan warriors and targets Merida, but Elinor intercedes, holding off Mordu and causing him to be crushed by a falling menhir. This releases the spirit of the prince, who silently thanks Merida for freeing him. As the sun rises for the second time, Merida realizes the mistakes she has made and reconciles with Elinor, unknowingly fulfilling the real meaning of the witchs message, causing the queen and the princes to turn back into humans.With Mordu gone, Merida and Elinor work together on a new tapestry when they are called to the docks to bid farewell to the other clans, and ride their horses.",185000000,"[{""id"": 16, ""name"": ""Animation""}, {""id"": 12, ""name"": ""Adventure""}, {""id"": 35, ""name"": ""Comedy""}, {""id"": 10751, ""name"": ""Family""}, {""id"": 28, ""name"": ""Action""}, {""id"": 14, ""name"": ""Fantasy""}]",http://disney.go.com/brave/#/home,62177,"[{""id"": 388, ""name"": ""scotland""}, {""id"": 526, ""name"": ""rebel""}, {""id"": 3930, ""name"": ""bravery""}, {""id"": 4152, ""name"": ""kingdom""}, {""id"": 4393, ""name"": ""archer""}, {""id"": 4896, ""name"": ""wish""}, {""id"": 10468, ""name"": ""bear""}, {""id"": 14753, ""name"": ""scot""}, {""id"": 15161, ""name"": ""rebellious daughter""}, {""id"": 41538, ""name"": ""turns into animal""}, {""id"": 53995, ""name"": ""archery""}, {""id"": 162715, ""name"": ""ruins""}, {""id"": 179430, ""name"": ""aftercreditsstinger""}, {""id"": 181181, ""name"": ""peace offering""}, {""id"": 187056, ""name"": ""woman director""}, {""id"": 189098, ""name"": ""courage""}, {""id"": 209714, ""name"": ""3d""}]",en,"Brave is set in the mystical Scottish Highlands, where Mérida is the princess of a kingdom ruled by King Fergus and Queen Elinor.

105,106,Bridesmaids,2011,/wiki/Bridesmaids_(2011_film),"Annie Walker is a single woman in her mid thirties. Following the failure of her bakery due to the recession, her boyfriend left her, and she lost her savings, forcing her to take a job as a sales clerk in a jewelry store and share an apartment with an obnoxious English immigrant roommate Gil and his sister Brynn. Her business failure was so painful that she has given up baking entirely. Annie has a no-strings-attached sexual relationship with the self-absorbed Ted, but she hopes for something more from him. Her best friend, Lillian, is virtually her only source of happiness.Lillian becomes engaged and asks Annie to be her maid of honor. At the engagement party, Annie meets Lillians bridesmaids: cynical, worldly, long-married cousin Rita; naïve and idealistic newlywed friend from work, Becca; the grooms decidedly unfiltered sister Megan; and Helen, the rich, beautiful, and elite wife of the grooms boss. Helen and Annie, who are jealous of each others friendship with Lillian, take an instant dislike to each other, but Lillian persuades them to spend time together.Annie takes Lillian and the bridesmaids to a Brazilian steak restaurant for lunch before going to a chic bridal shop. Helen uses her influence to gain entry to the shop because Annie didnt make a reservation. While trying on gowns, the whole party— with the exception of Helen, who chose not to eat before the fitting —becomes sick from food poisoning. Later, Annies suggestion of a bachelorette party at Lillians parents lake house is overruled in favor of a trip to Las Vegas planned by Helen. Worried about her finances and too proud to accept a ticket paid for by Helen, Annie books a ticket in economy class although the rest of the party flies first-class. The trip is cut short by an outburst from Annie, who had accepted a sedative from Helen because of her massive fear of flying. The plane makes an emergency landing in Casper, Wyoming; and the party takes a bus back home. Annie apologizes, but Lillian decides that she wants Helen to take over planning the shower and the wedding.Annie continues to hope for a relationship with Ted, but Irish-American Officer Nathan Rhodes, a friendly State Patrol officer who had earlier let her off without a ticket for broken tail lights, begins flirting with her. Nathan encourages her to open a new bakery, but Annie declines. Following a romantic night together, Nathan buys baking supplies as a surprise, in the hopes that Annie will start baking again. Offended and overwhelmed, Annie leaves. Annie is later fired for being rude to a customer, and kicked out of her apartment by her roommates, forcing her to move in with her mother.Annie travels to Helens home in Chicago for the bridal shower, which has become a Parisian-themed event, an idea that Annie previously came up with but Helen turned down. Helen also upstages Annies heartfelt, handmade shower gift by giving Lillian a trip to Paris, an idea Helen stole from Annie. Enraged that Helen has taken credit for the Parisian theme, Annie throws a tantrum. Lillian kicks her out of the shower and the wedding. On her way home, Annie is involved in a car accident due to her still-broken tail lights, but the other driver flees the scene. Officer Rhodes ends up being the responding officer, and he admonishes her for not fixing her tail lights and taking responsibility for her life. When Annie dismisses him by saying she ""knows"" he didnt want anything but sex from her, Rhodes is upset, and storms off when Ted arrives to give Annie a ride. On the ride home, Ted asks Annie to perform oral sex on him. Frustrated, she breaks off the relationship and walks home.Annie becomes reclusive, refusing to leave her mothers house and obsessively watching television. Eventually, Megan arrives and gives Annie a pep talk, telling Annie that she must stop blaming the world for her problems and take control of her life. Annie realizes her errors and begins to repair her life, beginning to bake again and getting her car fixed. She tries to make amends with Nathan, but he is still upset over her previous actions and ignores her. On the day of the wedding, Helen appears at Annies doorstep distraught; Lillian has disappeared, and Helen begs for Annies help in finding her. While driving, Helen apologizes to Annie and opens up to her, revealing that people only involve her in their lives because she is good at planning events, but she does not have any true female friends, leading to something of a reconciliation between them. The two enlist Officer Rhodes to help, and he reluctantly agrees. The group finds Lillian at her own apartment, discovering that she ran from her wedding because of Helens extravagant planning and from fear of leaving her life in Milwaukee. After reconciling, Annie helps Lillian prepare for her wedding.Annie resumes her place as maid of honor. After the wedding, which Annie agrees with Helen is ""perfect"", Helen again apologizes to Annie, and states her hope that they can be friends in the future.

106,107,Broken City,2013,/wiki/Broken_City_(film),"NYPD police officer Billy Taggart (Mark Wahlberg) is arrested for the murder of Mikey Tavarez, who was believed to have raped and murdered 16-year-old Yesenia Barea but ""walked"" on a technicality. Chief Carl Fairbanks (Jeffrey Wright) goes to Mayor of New York City Nicholas Hostetler (Russell Crowe) with a witness and evidence incriminating the detective, but Hostetler buries the evidence. A judge clears Taggart as having shot Tavarez in self-defense. The mayor calls Taggart to his office for a private meeting and calls him ""a hero"", but still forces him to leave the police force.Seven years later, Taggart is living with his girlfriend Natalie Barrow (Natalie Martinez), an aspiring actress. Taggarts private detective business is on the verge of bankruptcy when Mayor Hostetler hires him to investigate his wife, Cathleen Hostetler (Catherine Zeta-Jones), who he thinks is having an affair. Helped by his assistant, Katy Bradshaw (Alona Tal), Taggart learns that Cathleen is seeing Paul Andrews (Kyle Chandler), the campaign manager of Hostetlers rival in the upcoming elections, Jack Valliant (Barry Pepper).At a fundraiser for Hostetlers campaign, Cathleen reveals to Taggart that she knows he has been following her and advises him not to trust her husband. Taggart delivers to Mayor Hostetler photos taken of Cathleen meeting with Andrews.At a film debut party, Barrow reveals that her real name is Natalia Barea and that Yesenia was her sister. At the screening, Taggart is shocked at Natalies sex scene and strongly disapproves; he had thought it would express poetic love but finds it akin to porn. Consumed with guilt over working for Hostetler, Taggart descends into regular drinking bouts. He argues with Natalie over the scene and about the people she is seeing during her work, and she breaks off the relationship.Taggart gets drunk, brawling with strangers while walking the city streets. He receives a phone call from Katy and rushes into a murder scene. When Taggart arrives, he learns that Andrews, Valliants campaign manager, has been found murdered.Taggart tells Fairbanks that he was hired by Mayor Hostetler to investigate his wife. They learn that the candidate Valliant was in Andrews apartment. Valliant reveals that Andrews was scheduled to meet Todd Lancaster (James Ransone), the son of Hostetlers wealthy benefactor, contractor Sam Lancaster (Griffin Dunne). A furious Cathleen tells Taggart that Andrews was a close friend of hers, not a lover, and that he had promised her information about Hostetlers plans for the Bolton Village Housing Project. The deal was expected to enrich both Sam Lancaster and the mayor. Hostetler wanted to find out Cathleens source, so he manipulated Taggart into tracking her. Taggart decides to investigate Mayor Hostetler for corruption. He goes to Lancasters construction business and finds workers destroying loads of documents. Stealing some of the documents, he discovers that Bolton Village has been sold in order to build high-rise office buildings, rather than a new housing development. Hundreds of impoverished people will be left homeless while Hostetler and Lancaster make a profit. After leaving Lancasters, Taggart is pursued in a car chase by Hostetlers men, who run him off the road and take back the documents. Taggart visits Sams son Todd Lancaster, who says he had intended to give Andrews a copy of the demolition contract as evidence against Hostetler on the night Andrews was murdered. He gives it to Taggart instead. Taggart confronts Mayor Hostetler, who is unfazed because he has kept a video showing that Taggart murdered Tavarez in cold blood. Taggart records their conversation, as the Mayor admits to his own corrupt dealings.Since there is no statute of limitations on murder, Taggart can still be prosecuted and face prison time. Willing to make the recording public, although he would endanger his freedom, Taggart turns the recording over to Commissioner Fairbanks.  While Hostetler is at home celebrating a successful debate, Fairbanks arrives to arrest him. Fairbanks tells the mayor he was having an affair with Cathleen. In the films final scene, Taggart meets Fairbanks at a bar, and they toast Valliant, who has won the election.

112,113,Buried,2010,/wiki/Buried_(film),"In 2006 Paul Conroy, an American civilian working in Iraq, wakes to find himself buried in a wooden coffin with only a Zippo lighter and a BlackBerry phone at hand. He starts to piece together what has happened to him. He remembers that he and several others were ambushed by terrorists. He was hit by a rock and passed out. He receives a call from his kidnapper, Jabir, demanding that he pay a ransom of $5 million by 9PM or he will be left in the coffin to die.Conroy calls the State Department, which tells him that due to the government policy of not negotiating with terrorists, it will not pay the ransom but will try to rescue him. They connect him with Dan Brenner, head of the Hostage Working Group, who tells Conroy they are doing their best to find him.Jabir calls Conroy and demands he make a ransom video, threatening to execute one of his colleagues who survived the attack. Conroy insists that no one will pay $5 million, so Jabir drops the amount to $1 million. Despite his compliance in making a video, the kidnappers execute his colleague and send him the video of it. Shortly afterwards distant explosions shake the area, damaging his coffin which begins to slowly fill with sand. Conroy continues sporadic phone calls with Brenner, skeptical of his promises of help. To reaffirm his intentions, Brenner tells Conroy about a man named Mark White who was rescued from a similar situation three weeks previously and is home with his family.Conroy receives a phone call from his employers who inform him that he has been fired from his job due to an alleged prohibited relationship with a colleague, so he and his family will not be entitled to any benefits or pension earned with the company. Brenner calls saying that the explosions that damaged his coffin earlier were in fact F-16 bombings, and that his kidnappers may have been killed. Conroy begins to lose hope and makes a last will and testament in video form, giving his son his clothes and his wife his personal savings. Jabir calls demanding Conroy video record himself cutting off a finger, threatening Conroys family back home if he refuses, saying that he had lost all of his own children. Conroy complies.Shortly after making the video, the cell phone rings, and Conroy begins to hear digging and distorted voices. The voices become clearer, saying to open the coffin, and the coffin opens. It abruptly becomes obvious that he hallucinated the encounter.Brenner calls and tells Conroy an insurgent has given details of where to find a man buried alive, and that they are driving out to rescue him. Conroy then receives a tearful call from his wife Linda, and he assures her that he is going to be okay. As sand continues to fill the coffin to dangerous levels, giving Conroy seconds left to live, Brenner calls and tells him that he and the rescue team have arrived at the burial site. Through the phone, digging is heard, but Conroy cannot hear any digging around him. The team digs up a coffin and opens it, but it turns out that the insurgent led them to Mark Whites coffin, the man Brenner claimed had been rescued. Now knowing that he is not going to be saved, Conroy tries to calm himself down and accepts his fate. The sand finally fills his coffin and he suffocates as the light goes out and the screen goes black. The last thing we hear is Brenner repeating, ""Im sorry, Paul, Im so sorry,"" as the connection times out.In a post-credits scene, a lighter illuminates the name ""Mark White"" on the lid of the coffin, written by Paul earlier.",1987650,"[{""id"": 18, ""name"": ""Drama""}, {""id"": 53, ""name"": ""Thriller""}, {""id"": 9648, ""name"": ""Mystery""}]",http://www.experienceburied.com/index.html,26388,"[{""id"": 1533, ""name"": ""isolation""}, {""id"": 1909, ""name"": ""coffin""}, {""id"": 4776, ""name"": ""race against time""}, {""id"": 7172, ""name"": ""buried alive""}, {""id"": 10349, ""name"": ""survival""}, {""id"": 13015, ""name"": ""terrorism""}, {""id"": 15017, ""name"": ""danger""}, {""id"": 15156, ""name"": ""cell phone""}, {""id"": 18034, ""name"": ""desert""}, {""id"": 157902, ""name"": ""psychological""}, {""id"": 179430, ""name"": ""aftercreditsstinger""}, {""id"": 206219, ""name"": ""captivity""}, {""id"": 206687, ""name"": ""chases and races""}, {""id"": 206690, ""name"": ""mind and soul""}, {""id"": 206704, ""name"": ""confined""}]",en,Paul is a U.S. truck driver working in Iraq.

113,114,Burlesque,2010,/wiki/Burlesque_(2010_American_film),"Ali Rose (Aguilera) moves to Los Angeles after she quits her bar job when her boss refuses to pay her. Once in L.A., she tries and fails at every audition she does until one night, she finds herself unknowingly in a burlesque club when she hears the music on the street. She finds Tess (Cher) and the dancers performing “Welcome to Burlesque” and decides to pursue a career on stage once she meets Jack (Gigandet) at the clubs bar. Jack refers her to Tess for an audition, but she is instantly rejected and ushered out by Sean (Tucci). Instead of leaving, Ali begins serving customers at the club as a waitress, while Jack asks Tess to give Ali a chance.When Georgia (Hough) becomes pregnant, auditions are held to replace her. Ali begins her audition when everyone leaves, and after performing ""Wagon Wheel Watusi"", persuades Tess to allow her to become one of the clubs dancers, much to the annoyance of Nikki (Bell), the lead performer who is always late and caught drinking before numbers. One day Ali has to replace Nikki on stage because Nikki is too drunk to perform. Nikki sabotages the performance by turning off the music that the dancers usually lip sync to, but before the curtain is dropped down, Ali impresses everyone with her amazing singing skills. Tess immediately decides to have Ali become the main star of a whole new show at the club. It becomes increasingly popular and Ali enjoys her newfound stardom while Nikki fumes in the background. Despite the clubs growing success, Tess is still unable to pay the bank the money that she owes.One night after the club closes, Tess, worried with the clubs economic prospects, sings ""You Havent Seen the Last of Me"". A very jealous Nikki shows up drunk and picks a fight with Tess, calling Ali a ""slut with mutant lungs"" and feels that Tess has rejected their long-term friendship for Ali. Tess, who has grown frustrated with Nikki, questions her gratitude for the help she has received from her during her many drunken binges. Angered, Nikki quits on the spot (before falsely claiming that she slept with Vince after his and Tesss honeymoon), and the altercation ends when Tess angrily retaliates by smashing the passenger side window on Nikkis convertible with a crowbar.Meanwhile, Ali and Jack become romantically attracted to each other. However, Jack is unable to act on his growing feelings for Ali due to his engagement to his girlfriend, who is away in New York City for work as an actress; Jack is encouraged by Sean to end the engagement as Ali is a better person than his shallow fiancée. Marcus begins to become increasingly infatuated with Ali, who begins to spend time with him, making Jack jealous. At Georgias wedding, Jack appears to call off his engagement and becomes drunk. That night, Ali and Jack sleep together, but the following morning Jacks fiancé, Natalie (Agron), unexpectedly returns from her play and finds the two in bed together, angrily insisting that she and Jack never broke up. Jack denies this, and while trying to fix things, he asks Ali to leave. Feeling heartbroken and betrayed, Ali runs to Sean for support, and learns that Sean is gay, due to his having spent the night with Georgias wedding DJ the night before. While making coffee, Ali receives a call from Marcus, and Sean prompts her to go with Marcus after his phone call, while Sean and Mark (the DJ) go on a date.While spending time with Marcus, Ali learns about ""air rights"", which refers to the empty space above a building and what can be done with it. Ali breaks things off with Marcus after she sees his plans to build a skyscraper on the property the club is on; Marcus protests this, asking why this suddenly makes him ""the bad guy"", to which Ali replies, ""It doesnt, Marcus. It just makes you the wrong guy"".  Ali tells Tess about the predicament, and together they inform the owner of the new million-dollar condos across the street; fearing the loss of business that would result from the obstruction of his prospective tenants view, he purchases the air rights to the clubs property. The resulting money is enough for Tess to buy out Vinces share (as they are divorced and he wanted out of the club), pay off the bank, and re-fashion the club to her own vision. She also makes up with Nikki, who tells Tess that she claimed she slept with Vince just to hurt her, and rehires her at the club after Nikki tells her she wants to ""come home"".Ali reunites with Jack after he tells her that its over with Natalie for good; Natalie was in denial, having cared more about her job than her relationship with Jack. After she finally earns Nikkis respect, Ali performs ""Show Me How You Burlesque"", written by Jack (who refused to allow Ali to listen or see his music throughout the movie due to it not being ""ready"") with all of the dancers on stage, much to the crowds delight.",55000000,"[{""id"": 18, ""name"": ""Drama""}, {""id"": 10749, ""name"": ""Romance""}]",http://www.burlesquethemovie.com/,42297,"[{""id"": 4344, ""name"": ""musical""}, {""id"": 12670, ""name"": ""los angeles""}, {""id"": 163070, ""name"": ""burlesque""}, {""id"": 191205, ""name"": ""burlesque dancer""}]",en,"The Burlesque Lounge has its best days behind it.

Rumlow blows himself up, attempting to kill Rogers. Maximoff telekinetically contains the explosion and throws it upward, damaging a nearby building and accidentally killing several Wakandan humanitarian workers.U.S. Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross informs the Avengers that the United Nations (UN) is preparing to pass the Sokovia Accords, which will establish a UN panel to oversee and control the team. The Avengers are divided: Tony Stark supports oversight because of his role in Ultrons creation and Sokovias devastation, while Rogers has more faith in his own judgment than that of a government. Meanwhile, Helmut Zemo tracks down and kills Barnes old Hydra handler, stealing a book containing the trigger words that activate Barnes brainwashing. At a conference in Vienna where the Accords are to be ratified, a bomb kills King TChaka of Wakanda. Security footage indicates the bomber is Barnes, whom TChakas son, TChalla, vows to kill. Informed by Sharon Carter of Barnes whereabouts and the authorities intentions to kill him, Rogers decides to try to bring in Barnes—his childhood friend and war comrade—himself. Rogers and Wilson track Barnes to Bucharest and attempt to protect him from TChalla and the authorities, but all four, including TChalla, are apprehended.Impersonating a psychiatrist sent to interview Barnes, Zemo recites the words to make Barnes obey him.

116,117,Captain America: The First Avenger,2014,/wiki/Captain_America:_The_First_Avenger,"In the present day, scientists in the Arctic uncover an old, frozen aircraft. In March 1942, Nazi officer Johann Schmidt and his men steal a mysterious relic called the Tesseract, which possesses untold powers, from the town of Tønsberg in German-occupied Norway.In New York City, Steve Rogers is rejected for World War II military recruitment because of various health and physical problems. While attending an exhibition of future technologies with his friend, Sgt. James ""Bucky"" Barnes, Rogers again attempts to enlist. Overhearing Rogers conversation with Barnes about wanting to help in the war, Dr. Abraham Erskine allows Rogers to enlist. He is recruited into the Strategic Scientific Reserve as part of a ""super-soldier"" experiment under Erskine, Col. Chester Phillips, and British agent Peggy Carter. Phillips is unconvinced by Erskines claims that Rogers is the right person for the procedure but relents after seeing Rogers commit an act of self-sacrificing bravery. The night before the treatment, Erskine reveals to Rogers that Schmidt underwent an imperfect version of the procedure and suffered permanent side-effects.Schmidt and Dr. Arnim Zola harness the energies of the Tesseract, intending to use the power to fuel Zolas inventions, mounting an offensive that will change the world. Schmidt discovers Erskines location and dispatches assassin Heinz Kruger to kill him. Erskine subjects Rogers to the super-soldier treatment, injecting him with a special serum and dosing him with ""vita-rays"". After Rogers emerges from the experiment taller and more muscular, an undercover Kruger kills Erskine and flees. Rogers pursues and captures Kruger, but the assassin avoids interrogation by committing suicide with a cyanide capsule. With Erskine dead and his super-soldier formula lost, U.S. Senator Brandt has Rogers tour the nation in a colorful costume as ""Captain America"" to promote war bonds while scientists study him and attempt to reverse-engineer the formula. In 1943, while on tour in Italy performing for active servicemen, Rogers learns that Barnes unit was MIA in a battle against Schmidts forces. Refusing to believe that Barnes is dead, Rogers has Carter and engineer Howard Stark fly him behind enemy lines to mount a solo rescue attempt. Rogers infiltrates the fortress of Schmidts Nazi division Hydra, freeing Barnes and the other prisoners. Rogers confronts Schmidt, who removes a mask to reveal a red, skull-like visage that earned him the sobriquet ""the Red Skull"". Schmidt escapes and Rogers returns to base with the freed soldiers.Rogers recruits Barnes, Dum Dum Dugan, Gabe Jones, Jim Morita, James Montgomery Falsworth, and Jacques Dernier to attack other known Hydra bases. Stark outfits Rogers with advanced equipment, most notably a circular shield made of vibranium, a rare, nearly indestructible metal. Rogers and his team sabotage various Hydra operations. The team later assaults a train carrying Zola. Rogers and Jones succeed in capturing Zola, but Barnes falls from the train to his assumed death. Using information extracted from Zola, the final Hydra stronghold is located, and Rogers leads an attack to stop Schmidt from using weapons of mass destruction on major American cities. Rogers climbs aboard Schmidts aircraft as it takes off. During the subsequent fight, the Tesseracts container is damaged. Schmidt physically handles the Tesseract, which opens a wormhole into space, sucking him into it. The Tesseract burns through the plane and is lost in the ocean. Seeing no way to land the plane without the risk of detonating its weapons, Rogers crashes it in the Arctic. Stark later recovers the Tesseract from the ocean floor but is unable to locate Rogers or the aircraft, presuming him dead.Rogers awakens in a 1940s-style hospital room.

117,118,Captain America: The First Avenger,2011,/wiki/Captain_America:_The_First_Avenger,"In the present day, scientists in the Arctic uncover an old, frozen aircraft. In March 1942, Nazi officer Johann Schmidt and his men steal a mysterious relic called the Tesseract, which possesses untold powers, from the town of Tønsberg in German-occupied Norway.In New York City, Steve Rogers is rejected for World War II military recruitment because of various health and physical problems. While attending an exhibition of future technologies with his friend, Sgt. James ""Bucky"" Barnes, Rogers again attempts to enlist. Overhearing Rogers conversation with Barnes about wanting to help in the war, Dr. Abraham Erskine allows Rogers to enlist. He is recruited into the Strategic Scientific Reserve as part of a ""super-soldier"" experiment under Erskine, Col. Chester Phillips, and British agent Peggy Carter. Phillips is unconvinced by Erskines claims that Rogers is the right person for the procedure but relents after seeing Rogers commit an act of self-sacrificing bravery. The night before the treatment, Erskine reveals to Rogers that Schmidt underwent an imperfect version of the procedure and suffered permanent side-effects.Schmidt and Dr. Arnim Zola harness the energies of the Tesseract, intending to use the power to fuel Zolas inventions, mounting an offensive that will change the world. Schmidt discovers Erskines location and dispatches assassin Heinz Kruger to kill him. Erskine subjects Rogers to the super-soldier treatment, injecting him with a special serum and dosing him with ""vita-rays"". After Rogers emerges from the experiment taller and more muscular, an undercover Kruger kills Erskine and flees. Rogers pursues and captures Kruger, but the assassin avoids interrogation by committing suicide with a cyanide capsule. With Erskine dead and his super-soldier formula lost, U.S. Senator Brandt has Rogers tour the nation in a colorful costume as ""Captain America"" to promote war bonds while scientists study him and attempt to reverse-engineer the formula. In 1943, while on tour in Italy performing for active servicemen, Rogers learns that Barnes unit was MIA in a battle against Schmidts forces. Refusing to believe that Barnes is dead, Rogers has Carter and engineer Howard Stark fly him behind enemy lines to mount a solo rescue attempt. Rogers infiltrates the fortress of Schmidts Nazi division Hydra, freeing Barnes and the other prisoners. Rogers confronts Schmidt, who removes a mask to reveal a red, skull-like visage that earned him the sobriquet ""the Red Skull"". Schmidt escapes and Rogers returns to base with the freed soldiers.Rogers recruits Barnes, Dum Dum Dugan, Gabe Jones, Jim Morita, James Montgomery Falsworth, and Jacques Dernier to attack other known Hydra bases. Stark outfits Rogers with advanced equipment, most notably a circular shield made of vibranium, a rare, nearly indestructible metal. Rogers and his team sabotage various Hydra operations. The team later assaults a train carrying Zola. Rogers and Jones succeed in capturing Zola, but Barnes falls from the train to his assumed death. Using information extracted from Zola, the final Hydra stronghold is located, and Rogers leads an attack to stop Schmidt from using weapons of mass destruction on major American cities. Rogers climbs aboard Schmidts aircraft as it takes off. During the subsequent fight, the Tesseracts container is damaged. Schmidt physically handles the Tesseract, which opens a wormhole into space, sucking him into it. The Tesseract burns through the plane and is lost in the ocean. Seeing no way to land the plane without the risk of detonating its weapons, Rogers crashes it in the Arctic. Stark later recovers the Tesseract from the ocean floor but is unable to locate Rogers or the aircraft, presuming him dead.Rogers awakens in a 1940s-style hospital room. Deducing from an anachronistic radio broadcast that something is wrong, he flees outside and finds himself in present-day Times Square, where S.H.I.E.L.D. director Nick Fury informs him that he has been ""asleep"" for nearly 70 years.

118,119,Captain America: The Winter Soldier,2016,/wiki/Captain_America:_The_Winter_Soldier,"Two years after the Battle of New York, Steve Rogers works in Washington, D.C. for the espionage agency S.H.I.E.L.D. under Director Nick Fury, while adjusting to contemporary society. Rogers and Agent Natasha Romanoff are sent with S.H.I.E.L.D.s counter-terrorism S.T.R.I.K.E. team, led by Agent Rumlow, to free hostages aboard a S.H.I.E.L.D. vessel from Georges Batroc and his mercenaries. Mid-mission, Rogers discovers Romanoff has another agenda: to extract data from the ships computers for Fury. Rogers returns to the Triskelion, S.H.I.E.L.D.s headquarters, to confront Fury and is briefed about Project Insight: three Helicarriers linked to spy satellites, designed to preemptively eliminate threats. Unable to decrypt the data recovered by Romanoff, Fury becomes suspicious about Insight and asks senior S.H.I.E.L.D. official and Secretary of Internal Security Alexander Pierce to delay the project.On his way to rendezvous with Maria Hill, Fury is ambushed by assailants led by a mysterious assassin called the Winter Soldier. Fury escapes to Rogers apartment, and warns Rogers that S.H.I.E.L.D. is compromised. Fury is gunned down by the Winter Soldier, before handing Rogers a flash drive containing data from the ship. Fury is pronounced dead during surgery, and Hill recovers the body. The next day, Pierce summons Rogers to the Triskelion. When Rogers withholds Furys information, Pierce brands him a fugitive. Hunted by S.T.R.I.K.E., Rogers meets with Romanoff. Using data in the flash drive, they discover a secret S.H.I.E.L.D. bunker in New Jersey, where they activate a supercomputer containing the preserved consciousness of Arnim Zola. Zola reveals that ever since S.H.I.E.L.D. was founded after World War II, Hydra has secretly operated within its ranks, sowing global chaos with the objective of making humanity surrender its freedom in exchange for security. The pair narrowly escape death when a S.H.I.E.L.D. missile destroys the bunker, and realize that Pierce is Hydras leader within S.H.I.E.L.D.Rogers and Romanoff enlist the help of former USAF pararescueman Sam Wilson, whom Rogers befriended, and acquire his powered ""Falcon"" wingpack. Deducing that S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Jasper Sitwell is a Hydra mole, they force him to divulge that Zola developed a data-mining algorithm that can identify individuals becoming threats to Hydra. The Insight Helicarriers will sweep the globe, using satellite-guided guns to eliminate these individuals. Rogers, Romanoff, and Wilson are ambushed by the Winter Soldier, who kills Sitwell. During the fight, Rogers recognizes the Winter Soldier as Bucky Barnes, his childhood best friend who supposedly fell to his death on a mission, but was actually captured and experimented upon after WWII. Hill manages to extract the trio to a safehouse where Fury, who had faked his death, is waiting with plans to sabotage the Helicarriers by replacing their controller chips.After the World Security Council members arrive for the Helicarriers launch, Rogers broadcasts Hydras plot to everyone at the Triskelion. Romanoff, disguised as one of the Council members, disarms Pierce. Fury arrives and forces Pierce to unlock S.H.I.E.L.D.s database so that Romanoff can leak classified information, exposing Hydra to the public. Following a struggle, Fury kills Pierce. Meanwhile, Rogers and Wilson storm two Helicarriers and replace the controller chips, but the Winter Soldier destroys Wilsons suit and fights Rogers on the third. Rogers fends him off and replaces the final chip, allowing Hill to take control and have the vessels destroy each other. Rogers refuses to fight the Winter Soldier in an attempt to reach his friend, but as the ship collides with the Triskelion, Rogers is thrown out into the Potomac River. The Winter Soldier rescues the unconscious Rogers before disappearing into the woods. With S.H.I.E.L.D. in disarray, Romanoff appears before a Senate subcommittee and Fury, under the cover of his apparent death, heads to Eastern Europe in pursuit of Hydras remaining cells.

120,121,Captain Phillips,2013,/wiki/Captain_Phillips_(film),"Richard Phillips takes command of MV Maersk Alabama, an unarmed container ship from the Port of Salalah in Oman, with orders to sail through the Guardafui Channel to Mombasa, Kenya. Wary of pirate activity off the coast of the Horn of Africa, he and First Officer Shane Murphy order strict security precautions on the vessel and carry out practice drills. During a drill, the vessel is chased by Somali pirates in two skiffs, and Phillips calls for help. Knowing that the pirates are listening to radio traffic, he pretends to call a warship, requesting immediate air support. One skiff turns around in response, and the other – manned by four heavily armed pirates led by Abduwali Muse – loses engine power trying to steer through Maersk Alabamas wake.The next day, Muses skiff, now fitted with two outboard engines, returns with the same four pirates aboard. Despite the best efforts of Phillips and his crew, the pirates secure their ladder to the Maersk Alabama. As they board, Phillips tells the crew to hide in the engine room and allows himself to be captured. He offers Muse the $30,000 in the ships safe, but Muses  orders are to ransom the ship and crew in exchange for millions of dollars of insurance money from the shipping company. While they search the ship, Murphy sees that the youngest pirate Bilal does not have sandals and tells the crew to line the engine room hallway with broken glass. Chief Engineer Mike Perry cuts power to the ship, plunging the lower decks into darkness. Bilal cuts his feet when they reach the engine room, and Muse continues to search alone. The crew members ambush Muse, holding him at knifepoint, and arrange to release him and the other pirates into a lifeboat. However, Muses right-hand man Nour Najee refuses to board the lifeboat with Muse unless Phillips goes with them. Once all are on the lifeboat, Najee attacks Phillips, forcing him into the vessel before launching the boat with all five of them on board.As the lifeboat heads for Somalia, tensions flare between the pirates as they run low on the plant-based amphetamine khat and lose contact with their mother ship. Najee becomes agitated and tries to convince the others to kill Phillips. They are later intercepted by the U.S. Navy destroyer USS Bainbridge. Bainbridges captain Frank Castellano is ordered to prevent the pirates from reaching the Somali coast by any means necessary. Even when additional ships arrive, Muse asserts that he has come too far and will not surrender. The negotiators are unable to change his mind and a DEVGRU SEAL team parachutes in to intervene, while Phillips makes an unsuccessful attempt to escape from the lifeboat before being quickly recaptured and repeatedly beaten by Najee.While three SEAL marksmen get into positions, Castellano and the SEALs continue to try to find a peaceful solution, eventually taking the lifeboat under tow. Muse agrees to board Bainbridge, where he is told that his clan elders have arrived to negotiate Phillipss ransom. In the lifeboat, Phillips prepares a goodbye letter to his wife in case he is killed, while Najee decides to take full control. Najee spots Phillips writing the letter and beats him further. Phillips retaliates by wrestling Najee until Bilal subdues Phillips by striking him in the back with his AK-47, injuring him. Najee convinces Bilal and Elmi that Phillips must be killed. The pirates tie up and blindfold Phillips, leaving him to say his final goodbyes. As the pirates prepare to shoot Phillips, Bainbridges crew stops the tow, causing Bilal and Najee to lose balance. This gives the marksmen three clear shots and they simultaneously kill all three pirates. Muse is arrested and taken into custody for piracy. Phillips is rescued from the lifeboat and treated. Although in shock and disoriented, he thanks the rescue team for saving his life.",55000000,"[{""id"": 28, ""name"": ""Action""}, {""id"": 18, ""name"": ""Drama""}, {""id"": 53, ""name"": ""Thriller""}]",http://www.captainphillipsmovie.com,109424,"[{""id"": 3799, ""name"": ""ship""}, {""id"": 4245, ""name"": ""hijacking""}, {""id"": 4265, ""name"": ""somalia""}, {""id"": 5420, ""name"": ""fisherman""}, {""id"": 11221, ""name"": ""blood""}, {""id"": 12987, ""name"": ""poverty""}, {""id"": 12988, ""name"": ""pirate""}, {""id"": 13015, ""name"": ""terrorism""}, {""id"": 15248, ""name"": ""commando""}, {""id"": 155238, ""name"": ""hijack""}, {""id"": 158022, ""name"": ""cargo ship""}, {""id"": 167843, ""name"": ""ship captain""}, {""id"": 195737, ""name"": ""ship hijacking""}, {""id"": 195739, ""name"": ""somali""}, {""id"": 195741, ""name"": ""commando unit""}]",en,"The true story of Captain Richard Phillips and the 2009 hijacking by Somali pirates of the US-flagged MV Maersk Alabama, the first American cargo ship to be hijacked in two hundred years.",52.786917,"[{""name"": ""Columbia Pictures"", ""id"": 5}]","[{""iso_3166_1"": ""US"", ""name"": ""United States of America""}]",10/10/2013,95000000,134,"[{""iso_639_1"": ""en"", ""name"": ""English""}, {""iso_639_1"": ""so"", ""name"": ""Somali""}]",Released,Out here survival is everything.,Captain Phillips,7.6,2454,0.131315291,0.07577616,0.5,0.5,0,-0.42422384,0.055539131,0.15992099,1.727272727

Zacharys parents, Alan (Christoph Waltz) and Nancy Cowan (Kate Winslet), visit the home of Michael (John C. Reilly) and Penelope Longstreet (Jodie Foster), Ethans parents. Their meeting is initially intended to be short, but due to various circumstances, the conversation continues to draw out.In fact, Alan and Nancy begin to leave the apartment on two occasions, but are drawn back in to further discussion.At first, the couples are friendly to each other, but their respective comments start to hurt feelings, making everyone argue with one another. Apart from fighting among themselves, the couples blame each other about who is responsible for the fight between their sons. Nancy calls the Longstreets ""superficially fair-minded"" and Penelope and Michael complain about Alans arrogant and dull attitude. Everyone also gets irritated with Alan when he accepts endless business phone calls on his BlackBerry, interrupting the discussion, and showing he has more interest in his business problems than the matter at hand. Michael also receives many phone calls from his ailing mother, to his frustration.Nancy accuses Michael of being a murderer because he, annoyed by the constant noise it made during the night, had earlier turned his daughter Courtneys pet hamster loose in the street. Penelope becomes emotional about the hamster and with everyone arguing with each other. Other issues include a risky drug Alan is working to defend and Michaels mother has been prescribed, and the question of idealism and responsibility that is part of Penelopes current work.Michael offers everyone a glass of fine scotch. Penelope claims she doesnt ""get drunk"" and Nancy drinks way too many and finally stops Alans phone calls by dropping his cellphone in Penelopes flower vase full of tulips and water. Penelope and Nancy both laugh uproariously while Michael and Alan try to blow-dry the BlackBerry.The conversation continues to decay into personal attacks and opinionated statements and, eventually, epithets are uttered (?).

122,123,Carrie,2013,/wiki/Carrie_(2013_film),"Alone in her home, Margaret White, a disturbed religious fanatic, gives birth to a baby girl, intending to kill the infant but changes her mind. Years later, her daughter Carrie, a shy, unassertive girl, nears her graduation from Ewen High School in Maine.While showering after swim class at school, Carrie experiences her first menstrual period, then naively thinks she is bleeding to death. As she runs out of the shower for help, the other girls ridicule her and throw tampons and pads at her. Longtime bully Chris Hargensen records the event on her smartphone and uploads it to YouTube. Miss Desjardin, the gym teacher, comforts Carrie and sends her home with Margaret, who believes menstruation is a sin. Margaret demands that Carrie abstain from showering with the others. When Carrie refuses, Margaret hits her in the forehead with a Bible and locks her in her ""prayer closet."" As Carrie screams to be let out, a crack appears on the door, and the crucifix in the closet begins to bleed. Miss Desjardin informs the girls who teased Carrie that they will endure boot camp-style detention for their behavior. Chris, however, refuses, causing her to be suspended from school and banned from the prom after denying the allegation on the incident and refusing to give up her smartphone, thinking that the explicit video of Carrie is in there. Chris storms out, vowing revenge.Carrie learns that she has telekinesis, the ability to move things with her mind. She researches her abilities, learning to harness them. Sue Snell regrets teasing Carrie in the shower room and attempts to make amends by asking her boyfriend, Tommy Ross, to take Carrie to the prom. Carrie accepts Tommys invitation, and after school, goes into the town and buys red velvet fabric, and makes a dress at home. When she tells her mother, Margaret forbids Carrie to attend. Asking her mother to relent, Carrie manifests her telekinesis. Margaret believes this power comes from the Devil and is proof that Carrie has been corrupted by sin.Chris, her boyfriend Billy Nolan, and his friends plan revenge on Carrie. They kill a pig and drain its blood into a bucket. Margaret tries to prevent Carrie from going to the prom, but Carrie locks her mother in the closet using her telekinetic powers. At the prom, Carrie is nervous and shy, but Tommy kindly puts her at ease. As part of Chris and Billys plan, Chris friend, Tina Blake, slips fake ballots into the voting box, which name Carrie and Tommy prom queen and king. At home, Sue receives a text from Chris taunting her about her revenge on Carrie. Sue drives to the prom, arriving just as Carrie and Tommy are about to be crowned. Sue sees the bucket of pigs blood dangling above Carrie and attempts to warn someone but Miss Desjardin locks her out of the gym, suspecting that Sue is planning to humiliate Carrie.Chris dumps the bucket of pigs blood onto Carrie and Tommy. Nicki plays the Chriss shower video on the projector as it appears on all the large screens above the stage, inciting laughter from some in the audience, until Carrie pushes Miss Desjardin with her powers when attempting to help her. The bucket falls onto Tommys head, killing him. Enraged, Carrie takes her revenge with her telekinesis, killing nearly all of the students and staff, but spares Desjardin. A fire breaks out and, as the school burns to the ground, Carrie walks away, leaving a trail of fire and destruction in her wake. Chris and Billy attempt to flee in Billys car. Chris urges Billy to run Carrie over, but Carrie crashes the car and holds the car with her abilities, killing Billy but not yet Chris. Chris attempts to run Carrie over herself but Carrie locks her inside the car, lifts it, and throws it at a gas station and Chris’s face is stuck through the window, killing her. Before leaving, Carrie tips over an electric power pole on the car, setting it on fire.Carrie arrives home and takes a bath and changes into her night gown afterwards. Margaret approaches her and Carrie tearfully tells her that she was correct that the audience would laugh at her but does not really tell her about the massacre. Carrie and Margaret embrace. Margaret tells Carrie about the night of Carries conception. After having shared a bed platonically with her husband, they yielded to temptation one night and, after praying for strength, Carries father ""took"" Margaret, who enjoyed the experience. After the talk, they hug but Margaret, who has been hiding a knife during that, stabs her in the back with the knife non-fatally and Carries telekinesis pushes each other back leaving Carrie tumbling down the stairs. Margaret walks up to her and tells Carrie that its not Carrie’s fault but Margarets and that the devil keeps on coming back which she has to keep killing it which to do that, she feels she would have to kill Carrie and Margaret attempts to do so and starts attacking Carrie but Carrie ends up killing her with several sharp tools. She becomes hysterical and makes stones rain from the sky to crush the house. When Sue arrives, a furious Carrie lifts her with her powers, but senses something inside Sue. Carrie tells her that baby girl as a result that Sue is pregnant, Sue understands what Carrie means and is shocked by Carries last words. Carrie protects Sue and throws her out of the house to safety as the house collapses and sinks, apparently killing Carrie as well.After giving her testimony in court regarding the prom incident, Sue visits Carrie and Margarets grave vandalized ""CARRIE WHITE BURNS IN HELL"" and places white roses by the headstone. As she leaves, the gravestone begins to break and Carries angry scream is heard.Alternative endingSue goes to Carrie and Margarets tombstone, vandalized ""CARRIE WHITE BURNS IN HELL"", and places white roses next to it. Sue suddenly feels pain from her pregnancy as in the babys coming out. Later on she is soon in the hospital about to give birth. After one last push, there is a moment of silence as she pulls up her shirt to see the baby. Suddenly, a bloodied hand bursts from her vagina and grabs Sue by the arm. Sue screams as her mother comforts her telling her to wake up and that her nightmare is over, revealing that what happened in the hospital and tombstone flowers was a dream. Sue continues to scream as she still sees the hand and a hidden photo of Carrie still soaked in pigs blood holding a bloodied baby. As Sue continues to scream while her mother is still there, we also see Sues baby still inside her stomach and a backup crib in her room for the day it comes out.",30000000,"[{""id"": 18, ""name"": ""Drama""}, {""id"": 27, ""name"": ""Horror""}]",http://www.carrie-movie.com,133805,"[{""id"": 321, ""name"": ""terror""}, {""id"": 818, ""name"": ""based on novel""}, {""id"": 3720, ""name"": ""power""}, {""id"": 5086, ""name"": ""telekinesis""}, {""id"": 6270, ""name"": ""high school""}, {""id"": 9714, ""name"": ""remake""}, {""id"": 9748, ""name"": ""revenge""}, {""id"": 9826, ""name"": ""murder""}, {""id"": 9864, ""name"": ""prank""}, {""id"": 10266, ""name"": ""prom""}, {""id"": 13130, ""name"": ""teenager""}, {""id"": 14601, ""name"": ""explosion""}, {""id"": 14819, ""name"": ""violence""}, {""id"": 14989, ""name"": ""religious""}, {""id"": 33740, ""name"": ""humiliation""}, {""id"": 187056, ""name"": ""woman director""}]",en,"A reimagining of the classic horror tale about Carrie White, a shy girl outcast by her peers and sheltered by her deeply religious mother, who unleashes telekinetic terror on her small town after being pushed too far at her senior prom.",63.848541,"[{""name"": ""Screen Gems"", ""id"": 3287}, {""name"": ""Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM)"", ""id"": 8411}, {""name"": ""Misher Films"", ""id"": 11581}]","[{""iso_3166_1"": ""US"", ""name"": ""United States of America""}]",10/16/2013,82394288,100,"[{""iso_639_1"": ""en"", ""name"": ""English""}]",Released,Know her name.

123,124,Cars,2011,/wiki/Cars_(film),"In a world populated by anthropomorphic talking vehicles, the last race of the Piston Cup championship ends in a three-way tie between retiring veteran Strip ""The King"" Weathers, infamous runner-up Chick Hicks and rookie Lightning McQueen. The tiebreaker race is scheduled for one week later at the Los Angeles International Speedway in California. McQueen is desperate to win the race, since it would not only make him the first rookie to win a championship, but also allow him to leave the unglamorous sponsorship of Rust-Eze, a bumper ointment company, and allow him to take The Kings place as the sponsored car of the lucrative Dinoco team. Eager to start practice in California as soon as possible, he pushes his big rig, Mack to travel all night long. While McQueen is sleeping, Mack drifts off, and is startled by a gang of four reckless street racers, causing McQueen to fall out the back of the trailer and onto the road. McQueen wakes in the middle of traffic and speeds off the highway to find Mack, but instead ends up lost in the run-down desert town of Radiator Springs, where he inadvertently ruins the pavement of its main road by accident.After being arrested, impounded overnight and guarded by a rusty yet friendly tow truck named Mater, McQueen is ordered by the town judge Doc Hudson to leave town immediately. However, the local lawyer Sally Carrera, requests that McQueen should instead be given community service to repave the road to which Doc reluctantly agrees. McQueen tries to repave the road in a single day but it turns out shoddy, forcing him to repave the road again. During this time, he befriends several of the cars and learns that Radiator Springs used to be a popular stopover along the old U.S. Route 66 but with the construction of Interstate 40 bypassing it, the town literally vanished from the map. McQueen also discovers that Doc is the ""Fabulous Hudson Hornet"", a three-time Piston Cup winner whose racing career ended after an accident in 1954 after which he was quickly forgotten by the sport. McQueen finishes repaving the road which has invigorated the cars to improve their town and spends an extra day in Radiator Springs with his new friends, before Mack and the media descend on the town led by a tip to McQueens location. McQueen reluctantly leaves with the media to get to California in time for the race while Sally chastises Doc upon discovering that he had tipped off the media to McQueens whereabouts, not wanting to be discovered by them instead.At the Los Angeles International Speedway, McQueens mind is not fully set on the race due to him missing Sally and his other new friends and he soon falls into last place. He is surprised to discover that Doc, who is decked out in his old racing colors, has taken over as his crew chief along with several other cars from Radiator Springs to help in the pit. Inspired and recalling tricks he learned from Doc and his friends, McQueen quickly emerges to lead the race into the final laps. But at the last minute Hicks (refusing to come behind Weathers again) side swipes Weathers and sends him into a dangerous spin, causing him to crash. Seeing this and recalling Docs fate, McQueen stops just short of the finish line which allows Hicks to win and drives back to push Weathers over the finish line. The crowd and media condemn Hicks victory but are nonetheless impressed with McQueens good sportsmanship. Though offered the Dinoco sponsorship deal, McQueen declines by insisting on staying with Rust-eze as an appreciation of their past support. Back at Radiator Springs, McQueen returns to reunite with Sally and announces that he will be setting up his racing headquarters, thereby putting Radiator Springs back on the map.",120000000,"[{""id"": 16, ""name"": ""Animation""}, {""id"": 12, ""name"": ""Adventure""}, {""id"": 35, ""name"": ""Comedy""}, {""id"": 10751, ""name"": ""Family""}]",http://disney.go.com/disneyvideos/animatedfilms/cars/,920,"[{""id"": 830, ""name"": ""car race""}, {""id"": 1926, ""name"": ""car journey""}, {""id"": 3787, ""name"": ""village and town""}, {""id"": 3796, ""name"": ""auto""}, {""id"": 4944, ""name"": ""route 66""}, {""id"": 4945, ""name"": ""wrecker""}, {""id"": 4946, ""name"": ""porsche""}, {""id"": 4948, ""name"": ""retirement""}, {""id"": 6007, ""name"": ""media""}, {""id"": 6054, ""name"": ""friendship""}, {""id"": 6075, ""name"": ""sport""}, {""id"": 11500, ""name"": ""anthropomorphism""}, {""id"": 12670, ""name"": ""los angeles""}, {""id"": 167043, ""name"": ""road movie""}, {""id"": 179430, ""name"": ""aftercreditsstinger""}, {""id"": 179431, ""name"": ""duringcreditsstinger""}]",en,"Lightning McQueen, a hotshot rookie race car driven to succeed, discovers that life is about the journey, not the finish line, when he finds himself unexpectedly detoured in the sleepy Route 66 town of Radiator Springs.

124,125,Cars 2,2011,/wiki/Cars_2,"Finn McMissile, a British spy, infiltrates the worlds largest untapped oil reserves owned by a group of lemon cars. After being discovered, he flees and fakes his death.Lightning McQueen, now a four-time Piston Cup champion, returns to Radiator Springs. However, Italian formula race car, Francesco Bernoulli, challenges McQueen to the newly created World Grand Prix, led by its creator, Sir Miles Axlerod. McQueen and his best friend Mater — along with Luigi, Guido, Fillmore, and Sarge — depart for Tokyo for the first race of the Grand Prix.Meanwhile, the lemons, who are led by weapons designer Professor Zündapp and an unknown mastermind, are secretly plotting to secure their oil profits by using an electromagnetic pulse emitter disguised as a camera. They plan to use the emitter to trigger and destabilize the use of Allinol, an environmentally friendly fuel that was created by Axlerod and is required for racers to use in the Grand Prix. McMissile and his partner Holley Shiftwell attempt to meet with American spy car Rod ""Torque"" Redline at a World Grand Prix promotional event in Tokyo, to receive information about the mastermind. Redline is captured and killed by Zündapps henchmen, but not before passing his information to Mater, who is then mistaken to be the American contact of Holley and Finn.At the first race, three cars are ignited by the camera. McQueen places second in the race after Bernoulli, due to Mater accidentally giving him bad racing advice shortly after evading Zündapps henchmen with help from Holley and Finn. Mater is soon abducted by Finn and boards his plane, where he helps to identify some of the information he was given. After traveling to Paris to collect more information from Finns old friend Tomber, they travel to Porto Corsa, Italy, where the next race is being held. During the race, Mater infiltrates the criminals meeting, just as the camera is used on a few more cars, causing a multi-car pileup that allows McQueen to finish first. Due to increased fears over Allinols safety, Axlerod lifts the requirement to use it for the final race. However, when McQueen decides to continue using it, the criminals plot to kill McQueen in the next race in London. This spooks Mater, causing him to blow his cover and allow him, Finn, and Holley to be captured.Mater is taken to and tied up inside the clock tower of the Big Ben. Mater learns that the camera did not function on McQueen, but the criminals tell him they planted a bomb in his pits as a backup plan, spurring him to break free and escape. Finn and Holley escape soon after, but realize that the bomb is on Maters air filter. Mater has already arrived at the pits when they tell him this, so he flees down the race course while McQueen chases after him. Finn apprehends Professor Zündapp at the finish line. The other lemons arrive and outnumber Finn, Holley, Mater, and McQueen, but they are soon rescued by the arrival of the other Radiator Springs residents. Mater then uses evidence he has seen to reveal that Axlerod is the mastermind of the plot who placed the bomb on Mater. Mater forces Axlerod to deactivate the bomb, and he and the other lemons are arrested.Mater receives an honorary knighthood from the Queen, while Sarge reveals that he changed McQueens fuel from Allinol to gasoline, explaining why the camera did not work on him.

125,126,Case 39,2010,/wiki/Case_39,"Emily Jenkins (Renée Zellweger) is a social worker living in Oregon, who is assigned to investigate the family of ten-year-old Lillith Sullivan (Jodelle Ferland), as her grades have declined and an emotional rift with her parents has emerged. Emily suspects that the parents have been mistreating Lillith. Emilys fears are confirmed when Lilliths parents try to kill her by gassing her in the oven at home. Emily saves Lillith with the help of Detective Mike Barron (Ian McShane). Lillith is originally sent to a childrens home, but she begs Emily to look after her instead. With the agreement of the board, Emily is assigned to take care of Lillith until a suitable foster family comes along. In the meantime, Lilliths parents, Edward and Margaret (Callum Keith Rennie and Kerry OMalley) are placed in a mental institution.Not too long after Lillith moves in, strange things begin to happen around Emily. Two weeks later, another of Emilys cases, a boy named Diego (Alexander Conti), suddenly murders his parents with a crowbar, and Barron informs Emily that somebody phoned Diego from her house the night before the crime. As she is suspected of involvement in the incident, Lillith undergoes a psychiatric evaluation by Emilys best friend, Douglas J. Ames (Bradley Cooper). During the session, however, Lillith turns the evaluation around, asking Douglas what his fears are and subtly threatening him. That night after receiving a strange phone call, Douglas is panicked by a mass of hornets coming out of his body in hysteria and kills himself in the bathroom.Emily gradually becomes fearful of Lillith, so she heads to the mental asylum for answers from Lilliths parents. They tell her that, far from being truly human, Lillith is actually a Succubus-like demon who feeds on emotion, and that they had tried to kill her in an attempt to save themselves. Lilliths father tells Emily that the only way to kill Lillith is to get her to sleep. Shortly after Emily leaves the asylum, Lilliths mother hallucinates being on fire, and her father is stabbed in the eye after attacking a fellow inmate through whom the voice of Lillith spoke. Barron initially thinks Emily should seek psychiatric help, but is later convinced when he receives a strange phone call in his home from Lillith. He arms himself to help Emily. However, he fatally shoots himself in the head with his shotgun, as Lilith makes him imagine he is being attacked by dogs.After realizing that her closest colleagues have been eliminated, and that the rest of her cases will be next, Emily  serves Lillith tea spiked with sedative. While Lillith is asleep, Emily sets fire to her house, hoping to get rid of her. However, the girl apparently escapes unharmed. A police officer offers to escort Emily and Lillith to a temporary place to sleep. As Emily is following the police cars, she suddenly takes a different route and drives her car at a high speed, hoping to bring fear to Lillith. Instead, Lillith forces Emily to relive her childhood memory of her mother driving fast in a rainstorm. Emily fights through the memory, telling herself that it is not real. The image fades, and Lillith appears scared by the fact that Emily was able to fight through her illusion.Emily drives the car off a pier. As the car sinks, Emily struggles to lock Lillith (now in her demonic true form) in the trunk. Emily then attempts to swim to the surface. The demon grabs Emilys foot to stop her from swimming away but Emily struggles and eventually breaks free, as a trapped Lillith sinks to the bottom.

In his position as an insurance agent, he is sent to represent his company, Brownstar Insurance, at a regional conference in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, as a replacement for his co-worker, Roger Lemke, who died in an auto-erotic asphyxiation accident. Tim idolized Roger, believing that his death was merely an unfortunate accident, and that he embodied all it was to be a moral Christian, the key criterion used to judge the winner of the coveted ""Two Diamonds"" award, which Roger had won three years in a row. Tims boss, Bill, pressures him to win again to ensure they keep the company afloat. At the conference, Lippe meets fellow insurance agents Ronald ""Ronimal"" Wilkes, Dean ""Dean-Z"" Ziegler, and Joan ""O-Fox"" Ostrowski-Fox. He also meets Bree, a sex worker who works the parking lot in front of the hotel. She affectionately calls him ""Butterscotch"" after he offers her candy. Initially wary of the conference-goers, he spends more time with Ron, Dean, and Joan, and develops genuine friendships, including a crush on Joan. All the insurance agents participate in a scavenger hunt. Tim is paired with Joan, and, after they win, they become intoxicated with Dean in the hotel swimming pool. Tim and Joans sexual tension builds to a head and, after making out in the pool, they have sex in Joans hotel room.  They were all seen in the pool by ASMI president Orin Helgesson.The next morning, Tim is guilt-ridden and calls Vanderhei to confess, before desperately asking her to marry him. After explaining she has been sleeping with other people and desires freedom, she suggests to Tim that he take the opportunity to start a new life. Tim returns to Joan, who attempts to comfort him by telling him what Lemke was really like: she was his lover but left him after his sexual appetites became too twisted for her, and he bribed Helgesson for each one of his awards. Tim refuses to believe this and leaves Joans room, accusing her of being a ""prostitute"" sent to destroy his life.He runs into Dean and accidentally lets slip Lemkes bribery. As his friend, Dean swears to not tell anyone. After receiving advice from Dean, Tim goes to Helgesson for his assessment; it does not go well, and under the pressure he ends up also bribing Helgesson for the award, leaving him penniless and ashamed. Tim later comes across Bree and accompanies her to a party, where he gets high and inadvertently starts a fight. Ron, Joan, and Dean show up just in time to rescue him and Bree, who says she is in love with Tim.  The night ends as Bill appears at Tims door to inform him that with the successful acquisition of another Two Diamond award, he has received a generous offer for the company; despite meaning the branchs closure, he has chosen to sell. While Bill formally announces the sale, Tim bursts in, takes over the podium, and reveals that his company has unethically acquired the award every year by bribing Helgesson and confesses to doing so himself. Helgesson flees the room, his reputation in tatters, and a furious Bill confronts Tim, his revelations having cost Bill the sale of his company. Tim responds by announcing his intention to leave the company and start another with his clients from Brownstar, 17 of which have agreed to stay with him. Bill storms off, dumbfounded.As the four friends say their goodbyes and prepare to see each other next year, Joan and Tim are shown happy as friends, and Dean invites Ron and Tim to stay at a wealthy friends cabin in Canada for the summer; both of them surprise Dean by gleefully accepting. The three of them go on to start their own company together called Top Notch, with Joan involved, too.",76135364.24,"[{""id"": 35, ""name"": ""Comedy""}]",http://www.foxsearchlight.com/cedarrapids/,52067,"[{""id"": 612, ""name"": ""hotel""}, {""id"": 1326, ""name"": ""infidelity""}, {""id"": 2864, ""name"": ""one-night stand""}, {""id"": 6054, ""name"": ""friendship""}, {""id"": 8181, ""name"": ""swimming pool""}, {""id"": 15111, ""name"": ""drinking""}, {""id"": 15112, ""name"": ""naive""}, {""id"": 179431, ""name"": ""duringcreditsstinger""}]",en,A naive Midwesterner insurance salesman travels to a big-city convention in an effort to save the jobs of his co-workers.,10.254807,"[{""name"": ""Ad Hominem Enterprises"", ""id"": 2361}]","[{""iso_3166_1"": ""US"", ""name"": ""United States of America""}]",2/11/2011,6861102,87,"[{""iso_639_1"": ""en"", ""name"": ""English""}]",Released,Today is the first day... of the rest of his weekend.,Cedar Rapids,5.9,135,0.687847018,0.244103342,0.5,0.5,0,-0.255896658,0.443743676,0.233213445,0.090117149
129,130,Central Intelligence,2016,/wiki/Central_Intelligence,"In 1996, star athlete Calvin Joyner is being honored at his high school. Halfway through Calvins speech, a group of bullies led by Trevor Olsen throw a naked fat Robbie Weirdicht, who was showering, into the hall where the assembly is taking place, embarrassing him. Only Calvin and his girlfriend, Maggie Johnson, are sympathetic towards Wierdicht.Twenty years later, Calvin is married to Maggie and works as a forensic accountant but is dissatisfied with his career. Maggie suggests they see a therapist to salvage their deteriorating marriage. At work, Calvin receives a friend request on Facebook from a man named Bob Stone, who invites Calvin out to meet.  Calvin goes out to meet Bob Stone who reveals himself to be Robbie Wierdicht.  Calvin is shocked to see that Wierdicht has transformed from a fat to a muscular, confident man. Stone asks Calvin to review a few accounting records. Calvin deciphers the records as multimillion-dollar transactions from an auction, with the final payment set to be made the following day. Stone avoids Calvins questions and spends the night on his couch.The next morning, a group of CIA agents led by Pamela Harris arrive at Calvins house in search of Stone, who escapes. Harris tells Joyner that Stone is a dangerous rogue agent who intends to sell satellite codes to the highest bidder. Soon after, Stone abducts Calvin and explains that he is trying to stop a criminal known as the Black Badger from selling the codes but needs Calvins skills to find the coordinates of the deals location. After an attack by a bounty hunter, Calvin flees and calls Maggie, telling her to meet him at the marriage counselors office. Harris intercepts him and tells him that Stone murdered his partner Phil Stanton and is the Black Badger himself. She warns him to refrain from telling Maggie and gives him a device to alert them to Stones location. Calvin then arrives for marriage counseling, where he finds Stone posing as the counselor.Stone convinces Calvin to help him, and Calvin sets up a meeting with Trevor Olson, who is able to track the offshore account for the auction, so they can get the deals location. At first he apologizes for his misdeed saying he has found God, only to admit he lied and laughs in their faces and bullies Bob again. Harris calls Calvin and threatens to arrest Maggie if he fails to help them detain Stone. Calvin is forced to betray Stone, and the CIA arrests him. As Harris tortures Stone to get him to confess, Calvin decides to help Stone escape. Calvin finds that the deal is happening in Boston and helps Stone steal a plane. At an underground parking garage, where the deal is assumed to be taking place, Stone enters alone, while Calvin sees Harris entering a short while later. He mistakenly assumes that she is the Black Badger and runs after her, but finds Stone meeting with the buyer and claiming to be the Black Badger. Stone shoots Calvin, grazing his neck, to keep him safe.Phil Stanton arrives, revealing that he is alive, and claims he is the real Black Badger. The buyer attempts to retrieve codes from both Stone and Stanton, but the CIA arrives and a shootout begins, while Calvin grabs both codes and runs outside. He encounters Stone and Stanton, who engage in combat. Unable to decide who is the criminal, Calvin randomly shoots Stone, but Stanton confesses that he is the Black Badger and that Stone is innocent. Calvin causes a distraction that allows Stone to rip Stantons throat out, killing him. The two deliver the codes to Harris, who then drops them off at their high school reunion, where Calvin reconciles with Maggie. Bob is announced as the Homecoming King, with Calvin revealing to Maggie that he hacked the voting system to ensure Stones win. Olson attempts to bully Stone a third time, but Stone knocks him out. As Stone delivers his speech, he relives his most embarrassing high-school moment and takes off all his clothes confidently. He walks off stage to unite with his high-school crush Darla McGuckian.Before the ending credits, Maggie is pregnant and Calvin has joined the CIA.

130,131,Chappie,2015,/wiki/Chappie_(film),"A skyrocketing crime rate leads the city of Johannesburg, South Africa to buy a squadron of scouts—state-of-the-art armour-plated attack robots—from weapons manufacturer Tetravaal.  These autonomous androids are developed by British scientist Deon Wilson and largely supplant the overwhelmed human police force. A competing project within the company is the remotely controlled MOOSE, developed by Australian soldier-turned-engineer Vincent Moore. Deon is praised for Tetravaals success but Vincent grows envious when the police are unwilling to give his heavy weapons platform equal attention.At home, Deon creates a prototype artificial intelligence that mimics a human mind to the point of feeling emotions and having opinions, but Tetravaal CEO Michelle Bradley refuses to let him test the A.I. on a police robot. Undeterred, Deon steals a recently damaged robot before it is destroyed and puts it in his van, along with the ""guard key"" needed to update the robots software.On his way home, he is kidnapped by a group of gangsters, Ninja, Yolandi, and Amerika, who threaten to kill him unless he reprograms a police robot to help them steal. Deon installs the new software into the damaged robot, which responds with child-like trepidation upon powering up. Deon and Yolandi calm the robot, teaching it words and naming it ""Chappie"". Despite Deon wanting to stay with the robot, Ninja forces him out of their hideout.Ninjas gang only has a few days to pay a debt of 20 million rand to Hippo, a powerful gangster. Yolandi sees Chappie as a child and wants to mother him, but Ninja grows impatient with his development due to both the impending deadline for the debt and Chappies irreplaceable battery running out, giving him days to live. Ninja tries to train Chappie to be a gangster by leaving him in a dangerous neighborhood to fend for himself. After being wounded by thugs, he is followed by Vincent, who plans to deactivate all Tetravaal scouts except for MOOSE. Vincent successfully extracts the guard key for his own use, but the traumatized Chappie escapes and returns to the hideout. Yolandi scolds Ninja for this mistreatment, but he manages to earn Chappies forgiveness by training him in martial arts and weapon handling. Ninja and Amerika trick Chappie into stealing cars for them, and lie about needing the money to replace his dying body.At Tetravaal, Vincent uses the guard key to upload a virus, thus sabotaging and disabling all scouts including Chappie. Johannesburgs criminals immediately run rampant in the streets, and Deon brings Chappie to the Tetravaal factory to fix him. After being restarted, Chappie notices a helmet used to control MOOSE. At the hideout, he re-engineers it to allow him to transfer his consciousness into a computer, so he can change bodies when his current one dies. Ninjas gang uses Chappie to rob an armored car, an act which is caught on the news, prompting Tetravaal to pursue him. When Chappie learns that Ninjas plan to acquire the body was a lie, he prepares to kill Ninja for betrayal. However, Deon arrives to warn them that Michelle Bradley has ordered that Chappie be destroyed. At that moment, the MOOSE robot (controlled remotely by Vincent) is launched to assassinate Deon and Chappie at the hideout, at the same time that Hippo arrives to collect his debt. Amerika and Hippo are killed in the ensuing battle, while Deon is mortally wounded. When Ninja is about to be killed, Yolandi sacrifices herself to save him and Chappie destroys MOOSE by detonating a bomb.Enraged by Yolandis death, Chappie drives Deon to the factory, storms into an office, and fiercely beats Vincent close to death. He then transfers the dying Deons consciousness into a spare robot through the modified MOOSE helmet. In return, the now-robotic Deon wirelessly transfers Chappies consciousness into one of the nearby disabled scouts. Deon and Chappie go into hiding as the police discontinue their contract with Tetravaal. While burning memorabilia of Yolandi, the grieving Ninja finds a box containing a doll copy of her and a flash drive marked ""Mommys Consciousness Test Backup"" which contains a copy of Yolandis consciousness that Chappie took while testing the device on her.

They stop in Kiev, Ukraine, to visit Chriss brother, Paul (Jonathan Sadowski), before heading on to Moscow, Russia, where Chris intends to propose to Natalie.Paul suggests they go for an ""extreme tour"" of Pripyat, an abandoned town which sits in the shadow of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant. Chris is against going on the tour because of the potential danger and would rather stay on the original plan of going to Moscow. They meet tour guide Yuri (Dimitri Diatchenko) and are joined by a backpacking couple, Norwegian Zoe (Ingrid Bolsø Berdal) and Australian Michael (Nathan Phillips). Yuri drives them through Ukraine, before they arrive at a Chernobyl Exclusion Zone checkpoint, where they are refused entry by the Ukrainian military. He then takes them to an alternate entry he discovered years ago.The group stops at a river where Yuri points out a large, mutated fish apparently able to live on land; while returning to their van several other mutant fish are seen in that river. The group is worried about radiation poisoning, but Yuri assures their safety with a Geiger counter. After spending a few hours exploring, Yuri takes them to the upper floor of an apartment building and shows them the Chernobyl nuclear plant on the near horizon. After hearing noises at the other end of the apartment, it is found to be a bear which runs through the hallway past them, but not harming them.The group prepares to leave Pripyat, and Yuri finds the wires in his van have been chewed through and destroyed. He tries to radio for help, to no avail. As night falls, the group decides on whether to hike to a nearby checkpoint which is 20 km (12 miles) away, or to stay put and wait for help. Suddenly, strange noises come from outside, where Yuri and Chris go out to investigate. Shots are heard and Paul runs out, only to return with Chris whose leg has been severely mauled, and claims that Yuri has been taken. While they decide to stay the whole night in their locked vehicle, suddenly they are attacked by dogs.The next day, Paul, Michael, and Amanda go out to look for Yuri. They follow a trail of blood to an abandoned cafeteria and find Yuris mutilated body. They take his gun and are chased by a creature through the building before returning to the van. Amanda checks her camera and one of the pictures shows a humanoid creature inside one of the apartment buildings. Natalie stays with the wounded Chris while the others begin the hike to the checkpoint.During the hike, Paul, Amanda, Michael, and Zoe find a parking lot, where they find parts for the van. On the way back they are chased by dogs and also attacked by mutant fish in a stream. Night falls as the group returns to the van, only to find it upside down and ripped to shreds. They find Natalies video camera, showing that she and Chris were attacked and captured by humanoid mutants. While searching for the two inside an old building, the group is chased by more mutants.During their escape, a traumatized Natalie is found and rescued, but when the group gets distracted by a mysterious young girl, Natalie is captured again. The rest of the group is swarmed by a horde of mutants and are forced to retreat. While fleeing through an underground passage, Michael is captured. As they continue, they find Chris engagement ring for Natalie, with no sign of Chris. While climbing a ladder, a gang of mutants drags Zoe back down, forcing Amanda and Paul to leave her behind, emerging from the passage right beside the exposed reactor core. Paul recognizes that extremely high radiation levels are causing their skin to blister. They come upon Natalies body before emerging outside, where they are confronted by Ukrainian military personnel. Blinded by radiation damage, Paul stumbles toward the soldiers, who fatally shoot him.Amanda falls unconscious, and later awakens on a gurney.

Some years later, Ellas father remarries Lady Tremaine, the widow of an old acquaintance, who has two daughters of her own, Drisella and Anastasia. Ella welcomes her new stepfamily, despite the stepsisters unpleasant attitudes. When Ellas father goes abroad for business, Lady Tremaine slowly reveals her cruel and jealous nature, as she pushes Ella to give up her bedroom to the stepsisters for the attic. When Ellas father unexpectedly dies during the trip, Lady Tremaine dismisses the household to save money and forces all of the chores on Ella. One morning, when her stepfamily see Ellas face covered in cinders due to her sleeping by the fireplace for warmth, they mock Ella as ""Cinderella"" and forbid her from eating with them.Crushed by their cruelty, Ella rides off into the woods, where she meets Kit, the crown prince, posing as a palace apprentice, along with his hunting party. Though Ella is unaware of Kits true identity, they both take a liking to each other. The two part without Kit learning Ellas name. The King, upon learning he has little time left to live, urges Kit that, for the advantage of the kingdom, he should take a princess for his bride at the upcoming royal ball. Kit persuades his father to also invite every eligible maiden in the kingdom to the ball, hoping to see Ella again.Upon receiving notice of the ball, Ella finds a gown that had once belonged to her late mother and decides to refashion it for the ball. On the night of the ball, Ella tries to join her stepfamily, but Lady Tremaine and her daughters tear her dress to shreds and leave without her. Ella runs into the garden in tears and meets an old beggar woman, who reveals herself to be her Fairy Godmother. To help Ella attend the ball, her Fairy Godmother magically transforms a pumpkin into a golden carriage, her four mice into white horses, two lizards into footmen, and a goose into the coachman. She then transforms Ellas ripped dress into a gorgeous blue gown, complete with a pair of magical glass slippers. As Ella leaves for the ball, the Fairy Godmother warns her the spell will break at the last stroke of midnight. Finally, she casts a spell to keep Ellas stepmother and stepsisters from recognizing her.At the ball, the entire court is entranced by Ella when she appears.

After returning home, Ella hides the remaining glass slipper left behind under the floorboards of her bedroom.The King passes away soon after, but not before giving his son permission to marry Ella. Now King, Kit issues a royal proclamation ordering every maiden in the kingdom to try on the slipper in an effort to find the girl. Ella hurries to retrieve the glass slipper to prove her identity, only to find her stepmother holding it. Having deduced that Ella is the mystery princess, Lady Tremaine tells her stepdaughter about her own tragic past and of the bitter effects it has caused on her life.

138,139,Clash of the Titans,2012,/wiki/Clash_of_the_Titans_(2010_film),"In ancient times, after defeating their predecessors, the Titans, the gods divided the world among themselves. Zeus took the skies, Poseidon took the seas, and Hades was left with the Underworld upon being tricked by Zeus. The gods created the mortals, whose faith and prayers has fueled the gods immortality. As time passed, however, mortals began to question and soon resist their creators, angering the Olympians.A fisherman named Spyros finds a coffin adrift in the sea, discovering a baby, Perseus, and the body of his mother, Danae. Spyros and his wife, Marmara, raise Perseus as their own son, alongside their daughter, Tekla. One day, an adult Perseus and his family watch soldiers from the city of Argos destroying the statue of Zeus. Infuriated at this, the Gods unleash the Furies who attack the soldiers. Hades then appears and destroys the familys fishing vessel, resulting in Perseus family drowning. Only Perseus survives and is found by a group of soldiers.Perseus is brought before King Cepheus and Queen Cassiopeia, who are celebrating their campaign against the gods. Queen Cassiopeia compares her daughter Andromeda to the gods and boasts that she is more beautiful than Aphrodite. The revelry is cut short by the arrival of Hades, who has been given leave by Zeus to punish the mortals for their defiance. Hades threatens to unleash his monster, the Kraken, against Argos, unless Andromeda is offered as a sacrifice. Before leaving, he also reveals that Perseus is a demigod and the son of Zeus. Perseus meets Io, who confirms his origin. According to Io, a king of Argos named Acrisius defied the Gods and laid siege on Olympus. Zeus wanted to teach him a lesson, but did not want to kill the humans, instead, he decided to make an example out of Acrisius and disguised himself as the king, and then had sex with Queen Danae. When Acrisius realized this, he executed his wife and her son, while cursing Zeus. Zeus punished him further by changing him into the deformed creature Calibos, who became obsessed with killing Perseus.Perseus leads the Kings Guard to the Stygian Witches, looking for a way to kill the Kraken. Seeking to help his newly discovered son, Zeus gives Perseus a sword forged on Mount Olympus and a winged horse named Pegasus. Perseus refuses the sword, but the captain of the Kings guard, Draco, keeps the sword for when Perseus needs it. However, Perseus likes Pegasus. Soon after, they are attacked by Calibos, who kills several of the Kings Guard. Draco severs Caliboss hand and forces him to flee. The band gives chase but they are attacked by giant scorpions called Scorpiochs that spring from spilled drops of Caliboss blood. They are saved by a band of Djinn, non-human desert sorcerers led by Sheik Suleiman, who tame the remaining Scorpions. Also wishing for the gods defeat, the Djinn lend their aid to Perseus and his band. As they continue to travel, Io aids and teaches Perseus and they begin to fall in love.The group arrives at the lair of the Stygian Witches and learn that to kill the Kraken, they must obtain and use the head of Medusa, a gorgon who resides in a temple in the Underworld. Any living creature that looks on Medusas eyes will turn into stone. Perseus, Io, Solon, Draco, and their remaining men travel to the entrance into the Underworld. The men enter Medusas temple lair while Io, being a woman and forbidden from entering, remains outside. Medusa kills most of the band, but Perseus finally manages to behead her by using his reflective shield to see her with his back turned. As he leaves the temple, Calibos appears behind Io and fatally stabs her. As Perseus and Calibos fight, Perseus accepts that he is a son of Zeus, picks up the Olympian sword, and stabs Calibos through the chest, which has restored him to his human form. With his last breath, Calibos urges Perseus not to become a god. As Io lies dying, she urges Perseus to leave her and save Andromeda and Argos. Perseus lovingly stays with her until her last breath instead of leaving immediately. Pegasus soon takes Perseus back to the city of Argos as the Kraken is released. The people of Argos seize and bind Andromeda to sacrifice her to the Kraken. Meanwhile, Hades reveals he does not require the faith or worship of mortals as Zeus does, as he has learned to survive on their fear. Hades then subdues the weakened Zeus.Perseus arrives at Argos and exposes Medusas head to the Kraken, which makes eye contact just before it is able to reach Andromeda. The Kraken gradually petrifies and crumbles. Prokopion, the insane leader of the Cult of Hades, attempts to kill Perseus, but Cepheus stops him and is stabbed, before both are killed when the Krakens petrified claw falls on them. Hades appears, intending to kill Perseus, but Perseus, invoking Zeus, throws his sword at Hades, forcing him back to the Underworld. Perseus rescues Andromeda, who will soon be crowned as Queen of Argos. She asks Perseus to stay by her side as the King, but he declines.

139,140,Clash of the Titans,2010,/wiki/Clash_of_the_Titans_(2010_film),"In ancient times, after defeating their predecessors, the Titans, the gods divided the world among themselves. Zeus took the skies, Poseidon took the seas, and Hades was left with the Underworld upon being tricked by Zeus. The gods created the mortals, whose faith and prayers has fueled the gods immortality. As time passed, however, mortals began to question and soon resist their creators, angering the Olympians.A fisherman named Spyros finds a coffin adrift in the sea, discovering a baby, Perseus, and the body of his mother, Danae. Spyros and his wife, Marmara, raise Perseus as their own son, alongside their daughter, Tekla. One day, an adult Perseus and his family watch soldiers from the city of Argos destroying the statue of Zeus. Infuriated at this, the Gods unleash the Furies who attack the soldiers. Hades then appears and destroys the familys fishing vessel, resulting in Perseus family drowning. Only Perseus survives and is found by a group of soldiers.Perseus is brought before King Cepheus and Queen Cassiopeia, who are celebrating their campaign against the gods. Queen Cassiopeia compares her daughter Andromeda to the gods and boasts that she is more beautiful than Aphrodite. The revelry is cut short by the arrival of Hades, who has been given leave by Zeus to punish the mortals for their defiance. Hades threatens to unleash his monster, the Kraken, against Argos, unless Andromeda is offered as a sacrifice. Before leaving, he also reveals that Perseus is a demigod and the son of Zeus. Perseus meets Io, who confirms his origin. According to Io, a king of Argos named Acrisius defied the Gods and laid siege on Olympus. Zeus wanted to teach him a lesson, but did not want to kill the humans, instead, he decided to make an example out of Acrisius and disguised himself as the king, and then had sex with Queen Danae. When Acrisius realized this, he executed his wife and her son, while cursing Zeus. Zeus punished him further by changing him into the deformed creature Calibos, who became obsessed with killing Perseus.Perseus leads the Kings Guard to the Stygian Witches, looking for a way to kill the Kraken. Seeking to help his newly discovered son, Zeus gives Perseus a sword forged on Mount Olympus and a winged horse named Pegasus. Perseus refuses the sword, but the captain of the Kings guard, Draco, keeps the sword for when Perseus needs it. However, Perseus likes Pegasus. Soon after, they are attacked by Calibos, who kills several of the Kings Guard. Draco severs Caliboss hand and forces him to flee.

141,142,Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs,2013,/wiki/Cloudy_with_a_Chance_of_Meatballs_(film),"Flint Lockwood is a wannabe-scientist who lives in Swallow Falls, a tiny island in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean that has sardines as the base of its economy. Flint lives with Tim, his widowed technophobic father, and his pet monkey, Steve. Despite Flints zealous enthusiasm, his inventions, including spray-on shoes, a remote controlled television, hair-un-balding serum, a flying car, a monkey thought translator, and rat birds, all end in failure.Flint then invents a machine that transforms water into food, called the ""Flint Lockwood Diatonic Super Mutating Dynamic Food Replicator"" (FLDSMDFR). Flint turns on the FLDSMDFR in his laboratory, but ends up overloading the houses electrical supply. He then decides to power the machine by hooking it up to a nearby power plant. When he turns the machine back on, it ends up rocketing through town, destroying Sardine Land (a park conceived by the mayor to increase tourism) before ultimately shooting up into the sky. While recovering from his failure, Flint meets Samantha ""Sam"" Sparks, a weather intern whose big break was ruined thanks to his actions. Their conversation is cut short when rainbow colored clouds float over the town and begin to rain cheeseburgers.The town rejoices in their renewed food choices, and Flint creates a communication device to send orders to the machine and order it to create different types of food. Swallow Falls (now renamed Chewandswallow) suddenly becomes a successful ""food tourism"" destination. Everything is going well until the townsfolk start greedily requesting food from Flints machine. Flint notices that the food is beginning to grow larger in size. Although he is concerned that the food is starting to ""over mutate"", the now morbidly obese mayor sees it as profitable for him and the city, and guilts Flint into continuing to make food rain.Citizens and worldly tourists in Chewandswallow are blissful until suddenly a large tornado formed of spaghetti and meatballs threatens the town. Flint rushes to his lab to turn the FLDSMDFR off and attempts to send a ""kill code"" to stop the machine, but the mayor, while trying to stop him by throwing a giant radish at him, accidentally destroys the communication device after ordering a vegas style all-you-can-eat buffet. With Flint unable to control the machine, a massive food storm is created which threatens the world. When Flints father encourages him to fix the mess, Flint gains self-confidence, places the kill code in a USB flash drive, and builds a new flying car to reach and deactivate the FLDSMDFR, with the aid of Sam, her cameraman Manny, Steve and Brent (namesake of the Baby Brent Sardine cannery).As they approach the machine in the sky, they find that it is now at the core of a giant meatball, where clouds go in the top and a food hurricane comes out the bottom. The machine sends living food to attack them. In the chaos, the flash drive with the kill code flies out of the window.Back at Chewandswallow, the citizens and tourists escape while the last leftovers fall. Mt. Leftovers collapses, causing an avalanche of food that destroys the town. Despite the avalanche ravaging Flints Lab, Tim manages to re-send the kill code to Flints cell phone from there. Flint then goes inside the meatball, finds the machine, and connects the phone to a port. To his dismay, Flint discovers that Tim sent him the wrong file by accident, so he is unable to stop the FLDSMDFR. Flint then gets an idea and uses his Spray-On Shoes formula on the machine, causing it to explode. With the machine destroyed, the food storm subsides and everyone is able to return safely to Chewandswallow. Tim finally shows his appreciation for his son and his inventions and Flint and Sam celebrate with a kiss.

143,144,Cloverfield,2016,/wiki/Cloverfield,"The film begins on April 27, 2009, at 6:42 AM, at Beth McIntyres dads apartment, where she and her boyfriend, Rob Hawkins, spent the night. Rob is taping a video with his camcorder. He wakes Beth up and asks her if shes ever been to Coney Island, when Rob says that he planned a date for them at Coney Island.The video then unexpectedly cuts to the evening of May 22, 2009. (When the new video taped on May 22 was recorded, the tape wasnt changed and the entire movie was taped over Rob and Beths Coney Island video. Parts of the video are shown throughout the film.) Rob has a farewell party thrown for him by his brother Jason and Jasons girlfriend Lily Ford, in celebration of Robs new job in Japan. Their friend, Hud Platt, films testimonials for Rob during the party. Beth brings a new man to the party.Beth and Rob argue over her guest and Beth leaves. A supposed earthquake strikes shortly after, causing a brief citywide power outage; the local news reports a capsized oil tanker near Liberty Island. When the party-goers leave the building, the severed head of the Statue of Liberty is hurled into the street in front of them. Hud records an enormous creature several blocks away collapsing the Woolworth Building. Later, during the citys evacuation, the creatures tail destroys the Brooklyn Bridge, killing Jason and several other people. News reports show the Army National Guards 42nd Infantry Division attacking the monster. Smaller ""parasite"" creatures fall off its body and attack nearby pedestrians and soldiers.By May 23, Rob listens to a phone message from Beth, stating that she is trapped in her apartment at the Time Warner Center and unable to move. Going against the crowd, Rob, Hud, Lily, and another party-goer, Marlena Diamond, venture into Midtown Manhattan to rescue Beth. By 3:17 am, they get caught in a battle between the creature and the Army National Guard and run into the subway, soon attacked by several of the parasitic creatures; during the scuffle, Marlena is bitten by one. The four escape the subway and come to a command center and field hospital. Marlena bleeds from her eyes in reaction to the bite. She is dragged into a tent, where she appears to explode. Rob, intending to save Beth, persuades one of the military leaders to let him go. The man then tells Rob when the last evacuation helicopter will depart before the military executes its ""Hammer Down Protocol,"" which will destroy Manhattan in an attempt to kill the monster.The group find Beth who is non-fatally impaled on the side of the chest on an exposed rebar which they remove. They rescue her and the four make their way to the evacuation site at Grand Central Terminal, where they encounter the creature once more. Lily is rushed into a departing Marine Corps helicopter and escapes. Moments later, Rob, Beth, and Hud are taken away in a second helicopter and witness the creature being bombed. The bombing causes the creature to fall, but it lunges at the groups helicopter, causing it to crash into Central Park.Less than an hour later, a voice on the crashed helicopters radio warns that the Hammer Down protocol will begin in fifteen minutes. The three friends regain consciousness and flee; Hud retrieves the camera when the creature suddenly appears and kills him. Rob and Beth grab the camera and take shelter under an arch as sirens blare and the bombing starts. Rob and Beth take turns leaving their last testimony of the days events. The bridge crumbles and the camera gets knocked out of Robs hand and buried beneath some rubble. Rob and Beth proclaim their love for each other just before another bomb goes off, with both screaming as the monster roars.A final scene shows the ending of the video prior to the attack on the camcorder, where Rob and Beth spent the afternoon in Coney Island. In the backdrop, an unknown object crashes into the ocean. Rob points the camera back in their faces, where Beth says, ""I had a good day.""After the credits, an unknown voice is heard saying, ""Help us."" However, when the audio is reversed, it says, ""Its still alive.""",25000000,"[{""id"": 28, ""name"": ""Action""}, {""id"": 53, ""name"": ""Thriller""}, {""id"": 878, ""name"": ""Science Fiction""}]",http://www.cloverfieldmovie.com/,7191,"[{""id"": 720, ""name"": ""helicopter""}, {""id"": 1299, ""name"": ""monster""}, {""id"": 1418, ""name"": ""skyscraper""}, {""id"": 1721, ""name"": ""fight""}, {""id"": 2249, ""name"": ""camcorder""}, {""id"": 4210, ""name"": ""panic""}, {""id"": 4630, ""name"": ""chaos""}, {""id"": 6152, ""name"": ""supernatural""}, {""id"": 6898, ""name"": ""quarantine""}, {""id"": 9713, ""name"": ""friends""}, {""id"": 9951, ""name"": ""alien""}, {""id"": 10084, ""name"": ""rescue""}, {""id"": 10349, ""name"": ""survival""}, {""id"": 10617, ""name"": ""disaster""}, {""id"": 10685, ""name"": ""escape""}, {""id"": 11100, ""name"": ""giant monster""}, {""id"": 161791, ""name"": ""kaiju""}, {""id"": 162365, ""name"": ""military""}, {""id"": 163053, ""name"": ""found footage""}, {""id"": 179430, ""name"": ""aftercreditsstinger""}]",en,"Five young New Yorkers throw their friend a going-away party the night that a monster the size of a skyscraper descends upon the city.

148,149,Concussion,2015,/wiki/Concussion_(2015_film),"Steelers center Mike Webster is found dead in his pickup truck, after years of self-mutilation and homelessness. Before his death, a fellow football player, Justin Strzelczyk, comes to him, and confides that he is starting to lose his memory, that he is saying odd things to his children, and nearly threw his wife against the wall. A disoriented Webster brushes the worries off, and deliriously tells him that the most important thing ""is to finish the game,"" which is what he said during his Hall of Fame speech.Bennet Omalu, a forensic pathologist with the Allegheny County, Pennsylvania coroners office, handles Websters autopsy. He wonders how a man, otherwise healthy, and fairly young, could have degenerated so quickly, and makes it a point to figure out why he died of a heart attack at only fifty. Omalu closely examines microscope slides of Websters brain and discovers that he had severe brain damage. He ultimately determines that Webster died as a result of the long-term effects of repeated blows to the head, a disorder he later calls chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). With the help of former Steelers team doctor Julian Bailes, fellow neurologist Steven T. DeKosky and county coroner Cyril Wecht, Omalu publishes a paper on his findings, which is initially dismissed by the NFL.Over the next few years, Omalu discovers that three other former NFL players, Strzelczyk (died 2004), Terry Long (died 2005), and Andre Waters (died 2006), had symptoms very similar to Websters. He finally persuades newly appointed NFL commissioner Roger Goodell to allow him to present his findings before a committee on player safety. However, the NFL does not take him seriously, and he is barred from the committee meeting, forcing Bailes, a former NFL employee, to give the presentation in his place. However, the meeting is a set up, where the NFL claims that the players head trauma was due to past injuries, having nothing to do with football. As he leaves the meeting, former NFL Players Association executive Dave Duerson angrily confronts Omalu and tells him to ""go back to Africa.""Omalu is subjected to considerable pressure to back down from his efforts, as football is a widely beloved sport in Pittsburgh, having provided jobs and allowed men to go to college. Wecht is subjected to a politically motivated prosecution on corruption charges, and Omalu is forced to leave Pittsburgh soon after, lest he be deported, or sent to prison on petty charges as punishment for tarnishing the NFL. Before leaving he urges the NFL to tell the truth. Omalus wife, Prema, suffers a miscarriage after being stalked. The Omalus are forced to leave their dream home outside Pittsburgh. They move to Lodi, California, where Omalu takes a job with the San Joaquin County coroners office.Three years later, Omalu is vindicated when Duerson commits suicide due to growing cognitive problems. In his suicide note, Duerson admits that Omalu was right. Omalu is allowed to address an NFLPA conference on concussions and CTE. He informs them that he once wished he had never known Mike Webster, but by knowing him, he has the responsibility to inform NFL players of the true risks that they take by playing. He says that he holds no resentment for the NFL and tells them to forgive themselves and be at peace. Amid growing scrutiny from Congress, the NFL is forced to take the concussion issue more seriously, and in 2011, NFL players sue the league for not properly informing them of the risk of CTE. Omalu is offered a job as chief medical examiner for the District of Columbia, but as explained in closing title cards, turns it down, remaining with Prema and their two children in California, where he became a U.S. citizen in February 2015.",35000000,"[{""id"": 18, ""name"": ""Drama""}]",http://www.sonypictures.com/movies/concussion/,321741,"[{""id"": 579, ""name"": ""american football""}, {""id"": 4526, ""name"": ""concussion""}, {""id"": 5565, ""name"": ""biography""}, {""id"": 167882, ""name"": ""professional sports""}, {""id"": 174818, ""name"": ""brain damage""}, {""id"": 197102, ""name"": ""sports injury""}, {""id"": 201189, ""name"": ""nfl""}, {""id"": 208788, ""name"": ""medical drama""}, {""id"": 234946, ""name"": ""human brain""}]",en,"A dramatic thriller based on the incredible true David vs. Goliath story of American immigrant Dr. Bennet Omalu, the brilliant forensic neuropathologist who made the first discovery of CTE, a football-related brain trauma, in a pro player and fought for the truth to be known.

149,150,Contagion,2011,/wiki/Contagion_(film),"Returning from a Hong Kong business trip, Beth Emhoff has a layover in Chicago to rendezvous with a former lover before returning to her family in Minneapolis. She appears to have contracted a cold during her trip. Her six-year-old son from a previous marriage, Clark, also becomes sick and is sent home from school. Beths condition worsens and two days later she collapses with severe seizures. Her husband, Mitch, rushes her to the hospital, but she dies of an unknown cause.Mitch returns home and finds that Clark has also died from a similar infection. Mitch is placed in isolation, but seems to be immune to the disease. He is released and returns home to his teenage daughter Jory, though they are unsure if shes inherited his immunity. She decides to stay with her father regardless. Mitch struggles with learning his wife was unfaithful, and protecting his daughter from infection. Meanwhile, everyone who had contact with Emhoff begins to spread the disease around the world.In Atlanta, representatives of the Department of Homeland Security meet with Dr. Ellis Cheever of the CDC and fear that the disease is a bio weapon terror attack over the Thanksgiving weekend. Dr. Cheever dispatches Dr. Erin Mears, an Epidemic Intelligence Service officer, to Minneapolis to begin investigating. Mears traces the outbreak to Emhoff, but after setting up triage camps in large venues, Dr. Mears becomes infected. Her evacuation is postponed, as airports close ahead of a quarantine. She later dies and is buried in a mass grave. As more and more people become infected with no cure in sight, social order begins to decay, with rampant looting of stores and homes. The U.S. President is moved underground while emergency services suffer absenteeism and no longer respond. Mitch and Jory attempt to escape to Wisconsin, but the borders are closed.At the CDC, Dr. Ally Hextall determines the virus is a mix of genetic material from pig and bat viruses. Work on a cure stalls because scientists cannot discover a cell culture within which to grow the newly named Meningoencephalitis Virus One (MEV-1).UCSF professor Dr. Ian Sussman violates orders from the CDC to destroy his samples, and on Day 12, with over 8 million already infected, identifies a usable MEV-1 cell culture using bat cells. Hextall uses the breakthrough to start work on a vaccine. Other scientists determine the virus is spread by fomites with a basic reproduction number of four, projecting that 1 in 12 (8.3%) of the world will be infected, with a 25-30% mortality rate.Conspiracy theorist Alan Krumwiede posts videos about the virus on his popular blog. In one video, he shows himself sick, and later shows he recovered using a herbal cure derived from forsythia. In a panic, people seeking forsythia overwhelm pharmacies.Krumwiedes claims attract national attention. During a television interview, he reveals that Dr. Cheever had secretly told his fiancé to leave Chicago before the city was quarantined. Cheever is informed the government may charge him for leaking information. Later, it is revealed Krumwiede had faked being infected in an attempt to increase profits for forsythia investors. He is arrested for conspiracy, securities fraud and manslaughter, but is released when his many supporters successfully raise his bail.Using an attenuated virus, Dr. Hextall identifies a possible vaccine. To cut out the lengthy testing process, she inoculates herself with it and visits her father, who is infected. Hextall does not contract MEV-1, and the vaccine is declared a success.The vaccine supply cant meet demand, so the CDC awards vaccinations with a one-year birth date lottery (first responders, doctors, and others exempt). Meanwhile, Mitch and Jory reconcile with the hope of life going back to normal.In the opening days, Dr. Leonora Orantes, a WHO epidemiologist, traveled to Hong Kong to follow the Beth Emhoff lead. She collaborates with Sun Feng and other local epidemiologists to identify Emhoff as patient zero, with security footage showing her in contact with the next three victims at a Macau casino. Before she can leave, Feng kidnaps Orantes, using her as leverage to obtain (anticipated) MEV-1 vaccines for his village. Orantes spends months living with the villagers until the vaccine arrives, and she is released. When her colleague tells her that similar kidnappings were widespread, and the doses were placebos, Orantes rushes back to warn the villagers, exhibiting Stockholm Syndrome.By Day 26, the death toll had reached at least 2.5 million in the U.S. and 26 million worldwide. The discovery, production and initial deliveries of vaccine took until Day 133, with vaccinations to run until nearly Day 500. The final death toll is not seen.Dr. Hextall places samples of MEV-1 in cryogenic storage, alongside samples of H1N1 and SARS.The source of the virus is revealed to viewers. A bulldozer owned by AIMM Alderson, the same company Beth worked for, clears some jungle and disturbs a bat, who takes food from a banana tree. That bat flies over a pig pen, dropping a chunk of banana, which is then eaten by a piglet. A chef from the Macau casino buys the piglet. As he handles the carcass in the kitchen, he does not wash his hands when called to meet a customer – Beth Emhoff. The chef shakes hands with Beth, giving her the mix of bat and pig viruses, making her patient zero.",60000000,"[{""id"": 18, ""name"": ""Drama""}, {""id"": 53, ""name"": ""Thriller""}, {""id"": 878, ""name"": ""Science Fiction""}]",http://contagionmovie.warnerbros.com/,39538,"[{""id"": 83, ""name"": ""saving the world""}, {""id"": 2766, ""name"": ""mutation""}, {""id"": 4884, ""name"": ""infection""}, {""id"": 6564, ""name"": ""terminal illness""}, {""id"": 6898, ""name"": ""quarantine""}, {""id"": 9744, ""name"": ""outbreak""}, {""id"": 13004, ""name"": ""medical""}, {""id"": 14674, ""name"": ""vaccine""}, {""id"": 14675, ""name"": ""lethal virus""}, {""id"": 14760, ""name"": ""scientist""}, {""id"": 17995, ""name"": ""epidemic""}]",en,"As an epidemic of a lethal airborne virus - that kills within days - rapidly grows, the worldwide medical community races to find a cure and control the panic that spreads faster than the virus itself.",38.820858,"[{""name"": ""Double Feature Films"", ""id"": 215}, {""name"": ""Regency Enterprises"", ""id"": 508}, {""name"": ""Warner Bros."", ""id"": 6194}, {""name"": ""Participant Media"", ""id"": 6735}, {""name"": ""Imagenation Abu Dhabi FZ"", ""id"": 6736}]","[{""iso_3166_1"": ""US"", ""name"": ""United States of America""}, {""iso_3166_1"": ""AE"", ""name"": ""United Arab Emirates""}]",9/8/2011,137551594,106,"[{""iso_639_1"": ""en"", ""name"": ""English""}, {""iso_639_1"": ""cn"", ""name"": ""\u5e7f\u5dde\u8bdd / \u5ee3\u5dde\u8a71""}, {""iso_639_1"": ""zh"", ""name"": ""\u666e\u901a\u8bdd""}]",Released,Nothing spreads like fear,Contagion,6.2,1325,0.5,0.241348207,0.166151702,0.5,-0.333848298,0.075196505,0.258651793,0.222565532,2.292526567

Chris decides to raise the money by running contraband, working with his former smuggling partner, Sebastian Abney (Ben Foster), who now owns a legitimate construction company. Promising Kate he will not run drugs, Chris joins a cargo ship, planning to buy $10,000,000 in fake bills in Panama and smuggle them into the U.S. He is joined by Andy, his good friend Danny Raymer (Lukas Haas), and gets help from crew mates. After Briggs breaks into Chris house and intimidates his wife and children, Kate moves into Sebastians house for safety.In Panama, Chris discovers that the only one who can provide high quality fake bills is crime lord Gonzalo (Diego Luna). Leaving Andy in the van with the money for the fake bills, Chris meets with Gonzalo to negotiate. Briggs calls Andy, threatens to kill one of Chris sons and forces him to take the money and buy cocaine. With the money gone, Chris and Danny agree to help Gonzalo rob an armored car in exchange for the fake bills. After a shootout in which Gonzalos group along with numerous police and security officers get killed, they successfully steal a Jackson Pollock painting that resembles a splattered tarp. Chris and Danny barely make it back to the ship with the fake bills and the painting. They drive the van with contraband into a container, which is loaded onto their cargo ship. Chris hits and berates Andy for using the money to buy cocaine, but apologizes when Andy explains the reason.It is revealed that Sebastian is working with Briggs, and he desperately needs money to pay gangster Jim Church (David OHara). Sebastian calls Chris and learns that Chris plans to get rid of the cocaine Andy bought. Sebastian instructs Briggs to threaten Kate. Through Kate, Briggs warns Chris not to dump the cocaine. Chris realizes that Sebastian has betrayed him. Sebastian contacts the cargo ships Captain Camp (J. K. Simmons), with whom he has a partnership. He tells Camp of Chris smuggled contraband, and promises him a share if he secures it. Unable to get Chris to give up the contraband, Camp calls U.S. Customs to inspect the ship in New Orleans. The Customs agents find the container with Chris van, which is empty except for the paint splattered tarp, which they ignore.Once Chris is on shore, Briggs and his thugs demand the drug package. Chris takes Briggs to Camps house, having made a duplicate key while on the ship, and knowingly activates the security system. Chris opens Camps carpet cleaner and retrieves the cocaine from it. While Briggs and his gang sit in Camps living room with the cocaine, Chris sneaks out. Camp awakens to the noise and comes into the living room as the police arrive. Both Briggss group and Camp are arrested for possession of the cocaine.Warned by Chris, Kate leaves Sebastians house. When she goes back to retrieve some personal items, Sebastian gets angry with her and accidentally pushes her against a bathtub. Thinking she is dead, he dumps her (unconscious) body in a yet to be poured foundation at one of his construction sites. Chris goes to Sebastians construction site and manages to locate and save Kate by calling her cellphone. Sebastian is arrested and sent to prison, where he is greeted by a lynch mob.Danny retrieves the fake bills, which were dumped into the Mississippi River by Chris before docking in New Orleans.

Though his ex-wife Pams arrogant second husband Roy (Jason Lee) offers to pay for the wedding, Jimmy is determined to find a way to come up with the money. Meanwhile, Paul is worried that his wife Debbie (Rashida Jones) is cheating on him, so he sets up a hidden camera. While Jimmy is selling a 1952 Andy Pafko baseball card to pay for the wedding, the card shop is robbed by Dave (Seann William Scott), who steals Jimmys card and Pauls favorite gun. They find out that Dave is going to rob a house that night so they stake out the house to retrieve the card and the gun. Jimmy and Paul arrest Dave, but he has already sold the card and the gun for drugs.Jimmy and Paul go to the drug dealer, Poh Boy (Guillermo Díaz), who tells them they may have the card if they retrieve a stolen car.

Gabriela reveals that she is the mistress of a drug lord who was kidnapped and murdered by Poh Boys gang. Jimmy previews the tape from Pauls hidden camera and finds what looks to be Debbie and another man, but he tells Paul there is nothing on it. Paul then sees the tape and is heartbroken when he sees that Jimmy has lied. Gabriela does not want to get Jimmy and Paul hurt, so she flees, leaving them a flashdrive concealed in a crucifix, which contains all the dealers contacts.Jimmy and Paul bail out Dave so he can retrieve the card and the gun from Poh Boy, but he falls out of a tree and dies.

152,153,Country Strong,2010,/wiki/Country_Strong,"Beau sings with Kelly, a recovering alcoholic going through rehab. He is clearly smitten by her, and it is later revealed that the two have been having an affair, even though Kelly is married to James. Kelly is checked out of rehab a month early by James, who wants her to go on a three-city tour to restore her image. She agrees on the condition that Beau becomes her opening act. James has already planned to see Chiles Stanton, a beauty queen with potential to become a rising singer, perform that night in hopes that she will be Kellys opener instead.On the night of Chiles performance, Beau dismisses Chiles as a ""Country Barbie"" and does not want her on the tour. Chiles performance nearly falls apart as she gets stage fright and can not sing; however, Beau steps in and begins to sing ""Friends in Low Places"". The two sing the song together, and it gives Chiles the courage to continue on her own. James is impressed by Beaus performance, and offers the opening act to both of them. He suggests that Beau and Chiles could make quite the duo, but Beau disagrees. Nevertheless, Beau agrees to go on the tour because he cares about Kelly.The first show is a disaster: before going on, Kelly receives an anonymous package containing a bloody baby doll with a note reading ""Baby Killer,"" referring to the baby Kelly miscarried when she fell off the stage in Dallas during her last concert before she went into rehab. At that concert, she was five months pregnant and was found to have a blood alcohol level of 0.19 when she was in the hospital for the injuries related to the fall. Kelly falls apart, starts drinking, and almost refuses to go on. However, she is coerced into going on stage by James. She begins to sing ""Country Strong"" but breaks down on stage. She attempts to try another song, ""A Fighter"", but breaks down again and is led off stage by her husband, ending the show. They tell the media at a press conference that they had to cancel the show due to food poisoning and head off to the next show.Beau ends his relationship with Kelly, and begins to spend more time with Chiles, whose fame has been increasing as the tour progresses. Chiles and Beau form a bond and Beau lets go of his earlier hostilities towards her. She even finishes the chorus to his song ""Give in to Me"". Later, Beau confronts James about Kellys worsening condition. James insists that Kelly may get better, and says that he cant let her go out with a failure. Beau disagrees and subtly admits their affair. Enraged, James punches him in the jaw.Before the next show in Austin, Kelly is unable to go on stage after drinking. Beau and Chiles still do their opening act, where they perform ""Give in to Me"" for the first time together. JJ, Kellys agent, nearly cancels the tour but is dissuaded by Kellys offer of sex; having witnessed this, Beau becomes frustrated with Kelly. That same night, Chiles and Beau have sex, and Beau confesses to Chiles that he likes her. In Dallas, Beau gives Chiles a pair of star-shaped earrings and asks her to move with him to California. Chiles immediately agrees, but then asks for more time to consider the offer.The two perform and Kelly comes out, this time sober and ready, and performs her entire set for the first time. Kelly performs ""Country Strong"", ""Shake That Thing"", and ""Coming Home"". After the concert, James and JJ immediately begin making plans for Kellys future. That night, Kelly commits suicide by overdosing on prescription medication.  She leaves a letter to Beau, echoing his earlier words that ""Love and fame cant live in the same place."" In the letter, she gives him the advice to choose ""love"". Beau takes her advice, and after Kellys funeral, he moves to California.Later on, Beau is singing in a bar in California, when Chiles walk in, wearing the earrings he gave her.

153,154,Courageous,2011,/wiki/Courageous_(film),"When his truck is stolen at a gas station, Nathan Hayes chases it and manages to reclaim the truck but the criminal gets away. Though he is injured, he crawls back to his truck, and sees that his little baby boy in the back is okay. When the police arrive, sheriffs deputies Adam Mitchell and Shane Fuller meet Hayes, discovering he is a new deputy, having recently moved to Albany, Georgia.The personal lives of these officers are observed: Mitchell adores his nine-year-old daughter, Emily, but is distant from his fifteen-year-old son, Dylan, because he doesnt share his sons interest in 5k runs. Hayes never knew his biological father, instead treating a neighbor as his father (even giving him Fathers Day cards annually), but would risk his life to save his three children; however, his teenage daughter Jade (Taylor Hutcherson), resents him because he has a strict policy about dating, and wont let her go out with her love interest Derrick. Fuller is divorced, as were his parents, and has joint custody of his son. David Thomson is young and single. Javier Martinez (Robert Amaya) is an immigrant struggling to provide for his family after being laid off when a construction company went over budget. While job-hunting he walks down an alley asking God what He wants him to do. Mitchell, thinking he is a different Javier recommended to him by a friend, calls him over to help with backyard projects and construction. After paying him for the job, Mitchell recommends him to a new full-time job, where he is hired.One day, Emily is killed by a drunk driver, devastating Mitchell and his family. Following his daughters death, Mitchell reads about fatherhood in the Bible. He decides he must be a better father and crafts a detailed ""Resolution"" to honor God in every aspect of his family. Mitchell, Hayes, Fuller, Thomson, and Martinez join him in his resolution at a formal ceremony conducted by Hayess neighborhood mentor, the man he thinks of as a father. As a result of the resolution, Mitchell and Fuller mend their relationships with their sons, Hayes with his daughter, and he also visits the grave of his biological father whom he had never met and forgives him. Thomson reveals that he fathered a child in college and deserted the mother after she refused to have an abortion. He writes the mother and seeks to mend their relationship and to see his child, after seeing that abandoning kids contributes to crime on the streets, and does not want that burden on her. Martinezs manager offers him a promotion on the condition that he falsify inventory documents. After being given a day to think about it, Martinez refuses, maintaining that it would be wrong. Impressed, his boss promotes him and raises his pay, revealing that the condition had been a test of Javiers integrity, with Javier being the only individual to pass after many others had been tested. Mitchell discovers that Fuller has been stealing drugs from police evidence to resell on the streets for money. Mitchell decides he must honor his Resolution and report the corruption. He sets up a sting leading to Fullers arrest and imprisonment. Fuller explains his motives that he was doing it for his son, feeling that his yearly pay wasnt enough to provide for him. Mitchell visits Fuller in jail where Fuller admits to his mistakes and asks Mitchell to look after his son. During a minor traffic stop, Hayes and Thomson unknowingly confront the armed leader of a gang they have been repeatedly encountering. One of the gang members is Derrick, who stops the gang leader from shooting Hayes with a shotgun. After an intense firefight, Deputy Hayes asks Derrick what hes doing with the gang, and the later responds that he had no one else that cared about him.At a Fathers Day church service, the men present the Resolution and Mitchell urges the fathers in the congregation to be a godly influence on their families. Mitchell runs in a 5K race with both his and Fullers sons, Hayes begins to teach and mentor Derrick in prison, and Thomson meets his daughter for the first time.",1000000,"[{""id"": 18, ""name"": ""Drama""}]",http://www.courageousthemovie.com,72213,"[{""id"": 5905, ""name"": ""father""}, {""id"": 6150, ""name"": ""faith""}]",en,"As law enforcement officers, Adam Mitchell, Nathan Hayes, and their partners are confident and focused.

On the advice of her classmate Madison, she takes nude photos with raunchy expressions of herself to send to Cal and tucks them away in an envelope inside her dresser drawer. Later, Emily calls Cal under the guise of needing help with the houses pilot light, but Cal sees through the ruse since he is secretly gardening at the old house in the night and sees that Emily did not really need any help.

162,163,Dark Shadows,2012,/wiki/Dark_Shadows_(film),"In 1760, the Collins family moves from Liverpool, England to Maine and establishes the fishing town Collinsport, where they build their estate, Collinwood.When he first arrives, the young son Barnabas meets the young Angelique Bouchard, who instantly becomes besotted with him. Angeliques mother, a witch, warns her against socialising with people of noble birth; however, this does not stop Angelique from following the family for many years, hoping to be loved by Barnabas, but to no avail.By 1776, Barnabas (Johnny Depp), now a grown man, falls in love with a young woman named Josette du Pres (Bella Heathcote), scorning Angelique (Eva Green), who works as a maid in his household. Turning to black magic, Angelique curses the Collins family, first by killing Barnabass parents (Ivan Kaye and Susanna Cappellaro) in an assumed accident, then by enchanting Josette to leap to her death from a seaside cliff called Widows Hill. In a fit of grief, Barnabas attempts to leap to his own death but fails, as Angelique curses him to the immortal life of a vampire. When he still rejects her advances, she turns the town against him, and he is buried alive in a coffin.196 years later, in 1972, a young Maggie Evans (also Bella Heathcote), under the assumed identity of ""Victoria Winters"", applies for a job as a governess at Collinwood and meets with the current reclusive matriarch, Elizabeth Collins Stoddard (Michelle Pfeiffer). Her nephew David (Gully McGrath), for whom Victoria will be caring, believes his mother, who drowned in a boating accident, still visits him. Victoria does not divulge that since her young age she, too, can see ghosts.After meeting with David, his live-in psychiatrist Julia Hoffman (Helena Bonham Carter), his father Roger (Jonny Lee Miller), and Elizabeths rebellious daughter Carolyn (Chloë Grace Moretz), Victoria is hired by Elizabeth. That night, Victoria sees the ghost of Josette, who warns that ""hes coming"" before disappearing after falling from a chandelier.Elsewhere, a group of construction workers dig up Barnabass coffin and inadvertently free him. After satiating his bloodthirst of 196 years and shocked by the modern times he finds himself in, Barnabas returns to Collinwood, and hypnotizes the groundskeeper, Willie Loomis (Jackie Earle Haley), as his personal Renfield, and introduces himself to the family as a ""distant relative"". Elizabeth believes him to be a con-man until he reveals hidden riches buried in a secret passage within the house, whereas Elizabeth thought the family to be destitute. After realising who and what Barnabas is, she asks him to keep it a secret to protect the children of his true nature, passing him off as his own descendant, ""Barnabas Collins III"".During his breakfast with his newfound family, Barnabas is instantly smitten with Victoria when he meets her as she resembles Josette. Resolved to honorably win her heart, he seeks out Carolyns advice on courting her. Angelique, now an immortal witch herself and Elizabeths rival, learns of Barnabas resurgence and visits him, informing him that she now has taken over Collinsport as a member of the upstanding community. In retaliation, Barnabas reopens the Collins Cannery family business and uses hypnosis to steal several of the fisherman crews who work for Angelique. As a result, she tries to buy him off. However, even after an episode of supernatural lust between the two, he rejects her offer. Meanwhile, Julia later discovers his identity by hypnotizing him and offers to cure his vampiric condition via blood transfusions.After successfully restoring the family fortune and business, Barnabas decides to hold a ball to reintroduce the family to the townsfolk with Carolyn suggesting that they make it a happening with musician Alice Cooper as the headliner. During the ball, Barnabas catches Roger stealing from guests coats and later finds Victoria gazing out from a balcony. Feeling comfortable around him, Victoria confides to Barnabas that shes actually an escapee from the mental asylum where her parents had her confined since she was a child due to her powers. Meanwhile, Angelique makes a grand appearance in order to see Barnabas. When she catches him and Victoria kissing, she becomes even more embittered.Motivated after Victoria reciprocated his feelings, Barnabas seeks out Julia (wishing even more desperately to be mortal again), only to find out that the latter has been using his blood to make herself immortal. Feeling betrayed, he drains her and dumps her seemingly dead body into the town bay with Willies help. After catching Roger trying to break into the secret passage, Barnabas gives him a choice: to stay and be an exemplary father to David or to leave with enough money to live his thieving life elsewhere. Roger chooses the latter, anguishing David. Barnabass true identity is finally revealed to the rest of the family and Victoria when he saves David from a falling disco ball. Victoria is scared by the revelation and runs away.Upset, Barnabas barges into Angeliques office to demand her to release him from his curse, and while she offers him blood due to her knowing that Julia is no longer around to provide him blood transfusions, she also threatens to send Victoria off Widows Hill, the same way she did to Josette, and offers him an ultimatum: Either become partners and lovers with her or be locked in a coffin again. With Barnabas rejecting the former, she proceeds to do the latter, this time placing him in the Collins Family Mausoleum. Shortly after, he is found and freed by David, alerted by his mothers ghost, and they return towards the mansion. Meanwhile, Angelique destroys the Collins Cannery and implicates Barnabas in the murders of Julia and all the people he had to feed on, turning the townsfolk against the family.At the mansion, Barnabas and Elizabeth see the police, Angelique, and the angry mob approaching as Carolyn withdraws into the mansion. Willing to turn himself in as long as she goes along with him, Barnabas reveals his and Angeliques true natures in front of an angry mob and a fight ensues, pitting Barnabas and Elizabeth against Angelique. During the fight (following the mobs departure upon these revelations), Carolyn reveals to her family that she is a werewolf and joins her family in their battle against Angelique, but a fire later breaks out in the house. Ultimately, the ghost of Davids mother (Josephine Butler) manages to hurl Angelique against the chandelier, which then falls to the ground, mortally wounding her as she starts to shatter. She reaches into her chest and literally offers her heart to Barnabas this time as it shatters as well, resulting in her death. Concerned for Victorias well-being, Barnabas storms off to look for her as David informs him through his mother that shes headed towards Widows Hill. As David asks Elizabeth what they will do now, Elizabeth says that they will do what theyve always done as the Collins family: ""Endure.""After catching up to Victoria at Widows Hill, Barnabas stops her from leaping and refuses to turn her into a vampire to save her from eternal suffering as an immortal, despite her request. Touched, Victoria throws herself from its cliffs anyway, resulting in Barnabas leaping after her and biting her, so that she can survive the fall as a vampire. She awakens, asking him to call her Josette, and the two kiss passionately on the rocky shore.The closing scene is at the bottom of the bay as Julia opens her eyes to her new immortal life.",150000000,"[{""id"": 35, ""name"": ""Comedy""}, {""id"": 14, ""name"": ""Fantasy""}]",http://darkshadowsmovie.warnerbros.com,62213,"[{""id"": 616, ""name"": ""witch""}, {""id"": 2883, ""name"": ""imprisonment""}, {""id"": 3133, ""name"": ""vampire""}, {""id"": 10541, ""name"": ""curse""}, {""id"": 11860, ""name"": ""fish out of water""}, {""id"": 15375, ""name"": ""chains""}, {""id"": 33505, ""name"": ""gothic""}, {""id"": 41410, ""name"": ""madness""}, {""id"": 155733, ""name"": ""old house""}, {""id"": 160269, ""name"": ""lost love""}, {""id"": 160274, ""name"": ""angry mob""}, {""id"": 160279, ""name"": ""18th century""}, {""id"": 162846, ""name"": ""ghost""}, {""id"": 190941, ""name"": ""hidden room""}, {""id"": 193263, ""name"": ""old mansion""}]",en,Vampire Barnabas Collins is inadvertently freed from his tomb and emerges into the very changed world of 1972.

164,165,Date Night,2010,/wiki/Date_Night,"Phil and Claire Foster (Steve Carell and Tina Fey) are a married couple from New Jersey with two children, Ollie and Charlotte, and whose domestic life has become boring and routine. They have not had sex in over a year. Phil is a tax lawyer while Claire is a realtor. They are motivated to reignite their romance after learning that their best friends, Brad and Haley (Mark Ruffalo and Kristen Wiig), are planning to divorce to escape the married-life routine and to have more excitement in their lives.To avoid the routine that had become their weekly ""date night"", Phil decides that he will take Claire to a trendy Manhattan restaurant, but they cannot get a table. Phil steals a reservation from a no-show couple, the Tripplehorns, despite Claires misgivings. While eating they are approached by two men, Collins (Common) and Armstrong (Jimmi Simpson), who question them about a flash drive they believe Phil and Claire stole from mobster boss Joe Miletto (Ray Liotta). Phil and Claire explain that they are not the Tripplehorns, but the men threaten them at gunpoint and dont believe them. Not seeing any other way out, Phil lies and tells them its in a boathouse in Central Park.At the boathouse, Claire pretends to search; while Collins and Armstrongs backs are turned, Phil hits them with a paddle and escapes with Claire on a boat. At a police station, Phil and Claire talk with Detective Arroyo (Taraji P. Henson), but discover Collins and Armstrong are also detectives, presumably on Milettos payroll. Realizing they cannot trust the police, they decide to find the real Tripplehorns. They return to the restaurant and find the cellphone number of the Tripplehorns.Claire remembers a former client, Holbrooke Grant (Mark Wahlberg), a security expert and James Bond-like action hero. He is consistently seen never wearing a shirt. At his apartment, Grant traces the cellphone signal to an apartment owned by Thomas Felton. Collins and Armstrong arrive, but Phil and Claire escape in Grants Audi R8.They arrive at Feltons apartment and break in. They question Felton, nicknamed ""Taste"" (James Franco), and his wife ""Whippit"" (Mila Kunis) about the flash drive and Joe Miletto. It turns out that they went to the restaurant, but left when they spotted Collins. Realizing they are in danger, the couple give the flash drive to Phil and flee. When Phil and Claire get back in the Audi, Armstrong and Collins shoot at them. Phil and Claire crash the Audi head-on into a Ford Crown Victoria taxicab, resulting in their Audi and the Ford being attached at the bumpers. Phil and the cab driver (J. B. Smoove) decide to drive off to get away. Phil climbs into the Ford to navigate while Claire navigates the Audi. Phil checks the flash drive on the drivers Amazon Kindle and finds pictures of district attorney Frank Crenshaw (William Fichtner) with prostitutes. After evading Collins and Armstrong, they are eventually hit and are separated by an SUV. The cab falls into the river; Phil and the driver escape, but without the flash drive.In a subway, Phil determines that Felton obtained the flash drive to blackmail Crenshaw. They return to Grants apartment, and Grant is reluctant to help after becoming exhausted by their incompetence, but Phil begs and he agrees. Phil and Claire go to an illegal strip club that Crenshaw frequents, with Claire under the guise of a new prostitute and Phil as her pimp. After doing a pole dance for Crenshaw, they confront him and tell him they are the Tripplehorns. Collins and Armstrong come in and hold them at gunpoint and take them up to the roof with Crenshaw. Miletto arrives with henchmen and it is revealed that Crenshaw has been paid by Miletto to keep him out of jail. When Phil mentions the photos, an argument escalates between the mobsters and Crenshaw, Collins and Armstrong. Phil asks Claire to count to three (her typical method of calming their children). When she does, a helicopter appears and Arroyo and the SWAT team come onto the roof to arrest Miletto, Crenshaw, and everyone else. It is revealed that Phil was wearing a wire courtesy of Grant, who informed Arroyo of the situation.After being declared heroes, Phil and Claire enjoy breakfast at a diner, where Phil admits he would marry Claire and have their kids all over again if given the chance. When they return home, they engage in enthusiastic kissing on their front lawn before lying on their backs and watching the sky.",55000000,"[{""id"": 35, ""name"": ""Comedy""}]",http://www.datenight-movie.com/,35056,"[{""id"": 248, ""name"": ""date""}, {""id"": 417, ""name"": ""corruption""}, {""id"": 444, ""name"": ""taxi""}, {""id"": 996, ""name"": ""expensive restaurant""}, {""id"": 1157, ""name"": ""wife husband relationship""}, {""id"": 1419, ""name"": ""gun""}, {""id"": 1422, ""name"": ""boat""}, {""id"": 1749, ""name"": ""taxi driver""}, {""id"": 1937, ""name"": ""document""}, {""id"": 1946, ""name"": ""restaurant""}, {""id"": 2405, ""name"": ""roof""}, {""id"": 2587, ""name"": ""married couple""}, {""id"": 6083, ""name"": ""politician""}, {""id"": 6593, ""name"": ""stripper""}, {""id"": 7281, ""name"": ""shooting""}, {""id"": 9727, ""name"": ""thief""}, {""id"": 9844, ""name"": ""car crash""}, {""id"": 10261, ""name"": ""stealing""}, {""id"": 10325, ""name"": ""mistaken identity""}, {""id"": 11734, ""name"": ""police corruption""}, {""id"": 179430, ""name"": ""aftercreditsstinger""}, {""id"": 179431, ""name"": ""duringcreditsstinger""}]",en,"Phil and Claire Foster fear that their mild-mannered relationship may be falling into a stale rut.

165,166,Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,2014,/wiki/Dawn_of_the_Planet_of_the_Apes,"Ten years after the pandemic of the deadly ALZ-113 virus, later called Simian Flu, the worldwide human population was drastically reduced, with only about one in five hundred genetically immune to the virus. Meanwhile, the apes, under the chimpanzee Caesar, all bestowed with genetically enhanced intelligence by the virus, have long established a colony in the Muir Woods near San Francisco.One day, a group of humans led by a man named Malcolm enter the apes territory from San Francisco in search of a hydroelectric dam that would restore power to the city. An encounter by Caesars son Blue Eyes and his friend Ash leads to the latters injury by a man named Carver. Malcolm manages to prevent further escalation while Caesar orders the humans to leave. Prompted by Koba, a scarred bonobo who holds a grudge against humans for his mistreatment as a test subject, Caesar brings his army to the humans community at an unfinished tower as a display of strength. Caesar announces his intent to fight the humans if forced to while demanding the humans to stay in their territory. Malcolm convinces his fellow leader Dreyfus to give him time to take a small team to the forest and reconcile with the apes so they can access the dam. He meets with Caesar, who allows them to work on the generator on the condition that they surrender their guns. As Malcolm, his wife Ellie, and son Alexander work, they bond with the apes. The fragile bonding is greatly helped when Ellie, a nurse, effectively treats Caesars wife Cornelias illness.Meanwhile, Dreyfus arms his community using the Fort Point armory. Koba discovers the armory and confronts Caesar of this, but accuses him of loving humans more than apes. Caesar beats Koba in response but refrains from killing him. Koba later returns to the armory and takes an assault rifle, killing two guards and then Carver as the humans succeed in repairing the generator and restoring power to the city. Koba takes advantage of their celebration to covertly set fire to the apes home. He then shoots Caesar, who falls into the underbrush below, and frames the humans for Caesars apparent death in order to wage war. Koba quickly takes command and leads the apes into San Francisco, where they plunder the armory and mount an assault on the tower. The apes breach the building and imprison the humans as Dreyfus flees underground. When Ash refuses Kobas orders to kill unarmed humans, citing Caesars teachings, Koba throws the ape to his death and has any other ape loyal to Caesar imprisoned.Malcolms family finds Caesar barely alive and transports him to his former house in San Francisco. Caesar reveals that Koba shot him and confesses that apes can be as corrupt and violent as humans. When Malcolm sneaks into the settlement to find medical supplies for Caesar, he encounters Blue Eyes, who spares him before learning that his father is still alive and that it was Koba who shot him, not the humans. After reconciling with Caesar, Blue Eyes returns to the tower and frees the imprisoned humans and apes. Malcolm escorts the apes into the tower, and then finds Dreyfus. He learns that the return of electricity allowed Dreyfus men to make radio contact with survivors at a military base, who are now coming to fight the apes. Caesar confronts Koba at the top of the tower; as they fight, Dreyfus detonates C-4 charges that destabilize the tower in a failed attempt to kill the apes, at the cost of his own life. Koba starts angrily shooting at the apes, but Caesar tackles him off a ledge. While clinging on a metal girder, Koba is disowned as an ape by Caesar and dropped to his death.Malcolm and Caesar acknowledge their friendship, with Malcolm warning of the approaching human military. Caesar responds that the humans will never forgive the apes for their attack and convinces Malcolm to leave with his family. He then stands before a kneeling mass of apes, preparing for war.",170000000,"[{""id"": 878, ""name"": ""Science Fiction""}, {""id"": 28, ""name"": ""Action""}, {""id"": 18, ""name"": ""Drama""}, {""id"": 53, ""name"": ""Thriller""}]",http://www.dawnofapes.com/,119450,"[{""id"": 3077, ""name"": ""leader""}, {""id"": 4090, ""name"": ""colony""}, {""id"": 4458, ""name"": ""post-apocalyptic""}, {""id"": 4565, ""name"": ""dystopia""}, {""id"": 5774, ""name"": ""forest""}, {""id"": 9663, ""name"": ""sequel""}, {""id"": 9720, ""name"": ""woods""}, {""id"": 14759, ""name"": ""ape""}, {""id"": 14760, ""name"": ""scientist""}, {""id"": 15149, ""name"": ""monkey""}, {""id"": 158025, ""name"": ""medical research""}, {""id"": 158130, ""name"": ""animal attack""}, {""id"": 188959, ""name"": ""plague""}, {""id"": 209714, ""name"": ""3d""}]",en,"A group of scientists in San Francisco struggle to stay alive in the aftermath of a plague that is wiping out humanity, while Caesar tries to maintain dominance over his community of intelligent apes.",243.791743,"[{""name"": ""Ingenious Media"", ""id"": 290}, {""name"": ""Chernin Entertainment"", ""id"": 7076}, {""name"": ""TSG Entertainment"", ""id"": 22213}]","[{""iso_3166_1"": ""US"", ""name"": ""United States of America""}]",6/26/2014,710644566,130,"[{""iso_639_1"": ""en"", ""name"": ""English""}]",Released,One last chance for peace.,Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,7.3,4410,0.5,0.203964323,0.212298453,0.5,-0.287701547,-0.00833413,0.296035677,0.197357118,4.180262153
166,167,Daybreakers,2010,/wiki/Daybreakers,"In 2019, a plague has transformed most of the worlds population into vampires. The human population has plummeted and the need for blood becomes desperate. Vampires deprived of blood for long durations degenerate into ""subsiders,"" psychotic bat-like creatures with no memories of who they were and whose only thought is the craving for blood. The few remaining humans are captured and harvested in laboratory farms while scientists research a synthetic blood substitute.Edward Dalton is the head hematologist for the largest supplier of human blood in the US, owned by Charles Bromley. Edward and colleague Christopher Caruso are developing a blood substitute.Driving home from a failed experiment, Dalton accidentally runs another vehicle off the road. Checking on the occupants of the other vehicle, he learns they are humans. With the police approaching, Dalton has them hide in his vehicle. They part ways, but not before their leader, Audrey, learns Edwards name and occupation from the ID badge on his jacket.At home, Edward is surprised by his estranged brother Frankie (Michael Dorman). Frankies gift of a bottle of pure human blood re-ignites a long-standing argument over Edwards sympathies towards humans. The argument is cut short when a subsider invades Edwards house, forcing the brothers to kill it.The next morning, Audrey visits Edwards home and hands him a note with instructions for a meeting. During the meeting, Edward is introduced to Lionel ""Elvis"" Cormac, a human who was once a vampire.  Before he can say how he reverted to human, a military team arrives with Frankie, who had followed Edward and intends to capture both Cormac and Audrey.  Audrey manages to knock Frankie unconscious and the three flee. Once they escape, Cormac explains that he was cured of vampirism when he was ejected from his sun-proof vehicle by a crash.  Exposed to the sun, Elvis burst into flames, but his life was saved when he landed in a river, having been exposed to the sun for a precise length of time to turn him human again. Edward agrees to help Cormac find a way to recreate the cure.That night Edward meets more human survivors, as well as Senator Turner, a vampire who is secretly helping the colony develop a cure. A convoy of humans heading to Audreys group is ambushed and captured. The soldiers  track the position of the vineyard, forcing Turner and the humans to flee. Audrey, Cormac and Edward stay behind so Edward can be cured. Edward is able to recreate the cure Elvis had explained, curing himself of vampirism. They attempt to regroup with Turner and the other humans, only to find they are all dead.One of the captured convoy, Alison, is revealed to be Charles human daughter. Charles has Frankie forcibly turn her into a vampire. She refuses to drink human blood, and turns into a subsider. She is rounded up with others and dragged into sunlight to burn to death. Witnessing Alisons death upsets Frankie, causing him to seek out his brother. Meanwhile the military imposes martial law to control the subsider population and preserve order.Edward, Cormac and Audrey break into Christophers home and ask him to help spread the cure. However, Christopher has finally discovered a viable blood substitute and is not interested in a cure. He summons soldiers who capture Audrey while Cormac and Edward escape. They are found by Frankie, who agrees to help. He attacks Cormac, but drinking his blood turns Frankie human again; revealing that the risky sunlight cure is unnecessary.Edward, trying to save Audrey, turns himself in to Charles, who gloats about his new monopoly of the blood substitute.  Edward taunts Charles into biting him, making him human again like Frankie.Edward leaves Charles at the mercy of soldiers who are on the brink of becoming subsiders.  Frankie arrives and, surrounded by soldiers, draws their attention to himself to allow Edward and Audrey to escape; a feeding frenzy results, as the hungry soldiers consume first Frankies blood and then that of the soldiers cured by it, until at last only (what at first appears to be three) six soldiers are left standing, cured and bewildered.  Christopher, to cover up the cure, shoots the six and is about to shoot Edward and Audrey when Cormac kills him with a crossbow.The three survivors drive off into the sunrise.  In a voice-over, Edward addresses the general population, announcing the cure, but may be too late as multiple subsiders appear before the screen turns black.",20000000,"[{""id"": 14, ""name"": ""Fantasy""}, {""id"": 27, ""name"": ""Horror""}, {""id"": 28, ""name"": ""Action""}, {""id"": 53, ""name"": ""Thriller""}, {""id"": 878, ""name"": ""Science Fiction""}]",http://www.daybreakersmovie.com/,19901,"[{""id"": 293, ""name"": ""female nudity""}, {""id"": 813, ""name"": ""sunrise""}, {""id"": 828, ""name"": ""waitress""}, {""id"": 1706, ""name"": ""experiment""}, {""id"": 2217, ""name"": ""rain""}, {""id"": 2725, ""name"": ""sunlight""}, {""id"": 3133, ""name"": ""vampire""}, {""id"": 4565, ""name"": ""dystopia""}, {""id"": 9767, ""name"": ""beautiful woman""}, {""id"": 9855, ""name"": ""slow motion scene""}, {""id"": 10327, ""name"": ""undead""}, {""id"": 11181, ""name"": ""decapitation""}, {""id"": 14760, ""name"": ""scientist""}, {""id"": 17995, ""name"": ""epidemic""}, {""id"": 233706, ""name"": ""night creatures""}]",en,"In the year 2019, a plague has transformed almost every human into vampires.

He is taken to Ajax and Angel Dust, who inject him with a serum designed to awaken latent mutant genes. They subject Wilson to days of torture to induce stress and trigger any mutation he may have, without success. When Wilson discovers Ajaxs real name is Francis and mocks him for it, Ajax leaves Wilson in a hyperbaric chamber that periodically takes him to the verge of asphyxiation over a weekend.

171,172,Deadpool,2017,/wiki/Deadpool_(film),"Wade Wilson is a dishonorably discharged special forces operative working as a mercenary when he meets Vanessa, a prostitute. They become romantically involved, and a year later she accepts his marriage proposal. Wilson is diagnosed with terminal cancer, and leaves Vanessa without warning so she will not have to watch him die.A mysterious recruiter approaches Wilson, offering an experimental cure for his cancer. He is taken to Ajax and Angel Dust, who inject him with a serum designed to awaken latent mutant genes. They subject Wilson to days of torture to induce stress and trigger any mutation he may have, without success. When Wilson discovers Ajaxs real name is Francis and mocks him for it, Ajax leaves Wilson in a hyperbaric chamber that periodically takes him to the verge of asphyxiation over a weekend. This finally activates a superhuman healing ability that cures the cancer but leaves Wilson severely disfigured with burn-like scars over his entire body. He escapes from the chamber and attacks Ajax but relents when told that his disfigurement can be cured. Ajax subdues Wilson and leaves him for dead in the now-burning laboratory.Wilson survives and seeks out Vanessa. He does not reveal to her he is alive fearing her reaction to his new appearance. After consulting with his best friend Weasel, Wilson decides to hunt down Ajax for the cure. He becomes a masked vigilante, adopting the name ""Deadpool"" (from Weasel picking him in a dead pool), and moves into the home of an elderly blind woman named Al. He questions and murders many of Ajaxs men until one, the recruiter, reveals his whereabouts. Deadpool intercepts Ajax and a convoy of armed men on an expressway. He kills everyone but Ajax, and demands the cure from him but the X-Man Colossus and his trainee Negasonic Teenage Warhead interrupt him. Colossus wants Deadpool to mend his ways and join the X-Men. Taking advantage of this distraction, Ajax escapes. He goes to Weasels bar where he learns of Vanessa.Ajax kidnaps Vanessa and takes her to a decommissioned helicarrier in a scrapyard. Deadpool convinces Colossus and Negasonic to help him. They battle Angel Dust and several soldiers while Deadpool fights his way to Ajax. During the battle, Negasonic accidentally destroys the equipment stabilizing the helicarrier. Deadpool protects Vanessa from the collapsing ship, while Colossus carries Negasonic and Angel Dust to safety. Ajax attacks Deadpool again but is overpowered.

173,174,Death at a Funeral,2010,/wiki/Death_at_a_Funeral_(2010_film),"A funeral service is held for the father of Aaron (Chris Rock) and Ryan (Martin Lawrence). Aaron, the older son, and his wife Michelle (Regina Hall) live at his parents home. Aaron and Michelle have been trying to buy their own home and have children but have been unsuccessful. Aaron envies his brother because Ryan is a successful author, while Aaron has not yet had his novel published, and resents him because Ryan would rather spend money on a first class airline ticket than help him pay for the funeral expenses.Aaron and Ryans cousin Elaine (Zoe Saldana) and her fiancé Oscar (James Marsden) are on their way to pick up Elaines brother Jeff (Columbus Short) before heading to the funeral. To ease Oscars nerves, she gives him a pill from a bottle labeled as Valium. Jeff later reveals to Elaine that it is a powerful hallucinogenic drug he has concocted for a friend. Chaos ensues when Oscar hallucinates that the coffin is moving. He knocks it over, and the body falls out of the coffin.Aaron is approached by an unknown guest, a dwarf named Frank (Peter Dinklage), who reveals himself to be the secret gay lover of his late father. Frank shows Aaron photos as proof and threatens to reveal them to Aaron and Ryans mother Cynthia (Loretta Devine) unless he is paid $30,000. While in shock, Aaron relays the situation to Ryan, who suggests Aaron to pay the money because Ryan claims that he is in debt. When Aaron and Ryan meet with Frank to pay him, Frank starts to deride Aarons ability as a writer and Aaron refuses to pay. Frank turns violent, but Aaron and Ryan subdue him, tying him up to prevent him from leaving. Family friend Norman (Tracy Morgan) enters the room, giving Frank several doses of what he also believes is Valium to try to calm him down. Jeff also enters the room, telling them that it is the same hallucinogen Oscar took earlier.When Jeff and Norman, who are supposed to be watching Frank, get distracted by Uncle Russell (Danny Glover), Frank releases himself from his bonds and is knocked unconscious upon falling over and hitting his head on a table. With Aaron, Ryan, Jeff and Norman believing that Frank is dead, they plan to put him in the coffin. While everyone is outside watching Oscar, who is on the roof naked and threatening to jump off the roof because he has seen Elaines ex-boyfriend Derek (Luke Wilson) kissing her, Aaron and Ryan put Frank in the coffin. Elaine tells Oscar that Derek forcibly kissed her and calms him down by revealing she is pregnant. With everyone back inside, they continue the eulogy. While Aaron awkwardly tries to give his speech, Frank starts banging on the coffin, then suddenly forces it open and emerges. The pictures fall out of Franks pocket, while Cynthia sees the pictures and screams at Frank, attacking him. Aaron yells for everyones attention as he delivers a moving and impromptu eulogy, saying that his father was a good man with flaws like everyone else.Aaron and Ryan say goodbye while Ryan gets a ride to the airport from Martina, whom he had been trying to seduce all day. Aaron and Michelle are finally alone when Aaron asks where Uncle Russell is. Michelle tells him that she gave him what she believes is Valium to calm him down, shocking Aaron. Uncle Russell sits on the roof naked, like Oscar had been, complaining about how ""everything is so green.""",9000000,"[{""id"": 35, ""name"": ""Comedy""}, {""id"": 18, ""name"": ""Drama""}]",http://www.deathatafuneral-themovie.com/,2196,"[{""id"": 380, ""name"": ""brother brother relationship""}, {""id"": 455, ""name"": ""farewell""}, {""id"": 494, ""name"": ""father son relationship""}, {""id"": 965, ""name"": ""age difference""}, {""id"": 970, ""name"": ""parents kids relationship""}, {""id"": 1328, ""name"": ""secret""}, {""id"": 1647, ""name"": ""sadness""}, {""id"": 1909, ""name"": ""coffin""}, {""id"": 3739, ""name"": ""funeral""}, {""id"": 4432, ""name"": ""gathering""}, {""id"": 4902, ""name"": ""surprise""}, {""id"": 5498, ""name"": ""lsd""}, {""id"": 5948, ""name"": ""studies""}, {""id"": 6410, ""name"": ""hallucinogen""}, {""id"": 11483, ""name"": ""drug trip""}, {""id"": 171070, ""name"": ""arrogance""}, {""id"": 189421, ""name"": ""female corpse""}]",en,Chaos ensues when a man tries to expose a dark secret regarding a recently deceased patriarch of a dysfunctional British family.,20.410354,"[{""name"": ""Sidney Kimmel Entertainment"", ""id"": 737}, {""name"": ""Parabolic Pictures"", ""id"": 1012}, {""name"": ""Stable Way Entertainment"", ""id"": 1013}, {""name"": ""Target Media Entertainment"", ""id"": 1014}, {""name"": ""VIP 2 Medienfonds"", ""id"": 3801}, {""name"": ""VIP 1 Medienfonds"", ""id"": 10760}]","[{""iso_3166_1"": ""GB"", ""name"": ""United Kingdom""}]",2/9/2007,46,90,"[{""iso_639_1"": ""en"", ""name"": ""English""}]",Released,From director Frank Oz comes the story of a family that puts the F U in funeral.,Death at a Funeral,6.9,497,0.239256531,0.5,0.5,0.720395565,-0.220395565,0,-0.260743469,0.160379678,5.11E-06

182,183,Detention of the Dead,2012,/wiki/Detention_of_the_Dead,"High school student Eddie (Jacob Zachar) reports to after-school detention at Lincoln High School. Upon arrival,  Eddie sees a few familiar faces: Janet (Christa B. Allen), a cheerleader whom he has a crush on; Brad (Jayson Blair), a jock and high-school football player who bullies Ed and plans to join the ROTC; Jimmy (Max Adler), another football player/jock who also bullies Eddie and is good friends with Brad; Ash (Justin Chon), a happy-go-lucky stoner; and Eddies best friend Willow (Alexa Nikolas), a goth who shares with him a love for zombie movies. During detention, Ash attempts to sell drugs to Mark (Joseph Porter), a quiet student in detention. Ash quickly realizes Mark is unwell and alerts Mrs. Rumblethorp (Michele Messmer). However Mark becomes aggressive, biting Mrs. Rumblethorp and forcing the group to evacuate the detention room.In the school corridors the group discover a wide-scale zombie outbreak with all the other students now undead. They decide to barricade themselves in the school library; believing no one would ever go there. Mrs. Rumblethorp eventually dies and reanimates, causing the group to restrain her as Ash decapitates her with a paper cutter. Some time later, the group decide to search the library for available information on zombies. While searching the book stacks, the librarian attacks and bites Jimmy, before Brad kills the zombie. Eddie and Willow argue that they must kill Jimmy before he becomes a zombie, but Brad remains confident that his friend can survive his bite, quickly revealed to be denial from previously being bitten by Mrs. Rumblethorp on the finger himself (due to stupidly trying to grab her head when they decapitated her). However, Jimmy accepts his fate and jumps out a window where he is eaten by a group of zombies. As the group panic at their situation, Ash convinces the group to smoke weed to calm their nerves. While doing so, the group bond, learning more about each other, challenging their original high-school stereotypes, which they list openly: the nerd (Eddie), the social outcast and goth (Willow), the popular, self-involved cheerleader (Janet), the jock (Brad) and the stoner (Ash). The group are attacked by the zombies and narrowly manage to remain safe within the library. Realizing the barricades will not hold, Brad, Willow and Ash decide to escape through the vents while Eddie and Janet remain in the library. While in the vents, the group discover zombified rats who eat Ash, before the vent breaks, leaving Willow and Brad stranded in the halls of the school. They arm themselves with Ashs severed legs and begin to fight through the hordes of zombies back to the library. Meanwhile, Janet convinces Eddie to take her virginity, but the pair are interrupted by Willow and Brad.Inside the library, Willow is hurt when she realizes Eddies intentions with Janet. Quickly the barricades of the door begin to weaken, before Brad eventually succumbs to his wounds and attacks Janet, who manages to knock him out of a window nearby. Eddie formulates a plan to escape, using a gun he had obtained in order to commit suicide after not getting into Harvard University. The survivors fight through the school corridors and make it to the school gym. While climbing a ladder up to the roof, a zombie bites Janet on the leg, but all three make it onto the roof. Realizing she is going to die, Janet pleads with Willow to shoot her. However the group are shocked to find the zombies can climb ladders, and all the bullets are used to fight back the oncoming zombies. The zombified Brad attacks the group, and Janet sacrifices herself by jumping off the roof with Brad. Eddie and Willow lose hope of survival, shortly before military units descend. The zombies are killed, and Eddie and Willow leave the school. As the pair share their first kiss, a zombified Janet tackles Eddie and the military open fire on her.",500000,"[{""id"": 35, ""name"": ""Comedy""}, {""id"": 27, ""name"": ""Horror""}]",http://www.detentionofthedead.com,139715,"[{""id"": 6270, ""name"": ""high school""}, {""id"": 10183, ""name"": ""independent film""}, {""id"": 12377, ""name"": ""zombie""}, {""id"": 14687, ""name"": ""extreme violence""}]",en,A group of oddball high school students find themselves trapped in detention with their classmates having turned into a horde of Zombies.,2.391847,"[{""name"": ""Gala Film"", ""id"": 4896}]","[{""iso_3166_1"": ""US"", ""name"": ""United States of America""}]",4/27/2012,0,87,"[{""iso_639_1"": ""en"", ""name"": ""English""}]",Released,"When there's no more room in Hell, the dead will go to DETENTION!",Detention of the Dead,4.5,34,0.042681813,0.183674097,0.024323165,0.5,-0.475676835,0.159350932,-0.140992284,0.25867335,0
183,184,Devil,2010,/wiki/Devil_(2010_film),"Ramirez (Jacob Vargas) speaks in a voice-over about stories that his mother told him about the devil sometimes actively seeking out individuals who have sinned while they are still alive on Earth. While taking human form, he traps them in a confined place only to turn them against each other, before killing them one at a time. Ramirez explains that the last victim will die in front of his or her loved one to ""make cynics of us all"". He says that the signs are set in motion with a suicide, as that is when the Devil first makes his presence known. This story is abruptly interrupted by a violent suicide of a man who had fallen from the thirty-fifth floor of a Philadelphia office building. The truck he falls on rolls silently away.Detective Bowden (Chris Messina) is a recovering alcoholic who is assigned to the case of the suicide. He later explains that the reason for his alcoholism was the hit and run death of his wife and son, five years previously, in which the perpetrator was never apprehended. Meanwhile, five strangers board an elevator, which later becomes stuck between floors. When security finds them, they notice that there is CCTV and a radio with which they can call into the elevator, but they have no way of hearing the passengers in return. Bowden takes the investigation regarding the elevator as it is the same building from which the suicide victim jumped.Ramirez is revealed to be one of the security guards and is disturbed by an image of what looks like a screaming face frozen on the video monitor. His boss Lustig (Matt Craven) dismisses the superstitious suspicions and sends repair technician Dwight (Joe Cobden) to investigate the elevators while Bowden tries to ascertain the identities of the individuals. Only four of the five are accounted for: Vince McCormick (Geoffrey Arend), a sleazy mattress salesman; Sarah Caraway (Bojana Novakovic), a pathological liar who plans to leave her rich husband and take his money with her; Ben Larson (Bokeem Woodbine), a temporary security guard with a history of violence; an unnamed older woman who police mistakenly believe is named Jane Kowski (Jenny OHara) who is seen on video to be a thief, and another man who later introduces himself as Tony (Logan Marshall-Green), who does not appear to have signed in at the security desk.The power goes on and off in the elevator, and each time the power is restored, something evil takes place. Dwight falls to his death on top of the elevator, and Lustig is electrocuted trying to restore power. Soon people in the elevator start dying, and the suspicion keeps shifting between all in the elevator. Vince is thrown into a mirror only to have his jugular vein sliced causing him to bleed to death, the old woman is hanged on a lamp cord from the elevator ceiling, Ben winds up on the floor with his neck twisted, and Sarahs throat is slit by a broken piece of the mirror. Finally, the old woman seemingly returns to life, but with coal black, staring eyes; it is revealed that she is the Devil, and that she has come for Tony and Sarah. In order to save Sarah, Tony confesses to having been responsible for a hit-and-run five years ago in which he killed a mother and her son. Detective Bowden hears him apologize over the radio. The Devil, powerless now that Tony has repented for his sin, curses before vanishing, and the elevator comes back online, sparing Tonys life. As the corpses of Sarah, Ben, and Vince are wheeled away, Bowden decides to take Tony into custody, and, while en route, informs him that he is the husband and father of the mother and son Tony killed in that accident. But despite saying hed gone over what hed say, or what he would do if theyd ever cross paths, he forgives Tony.Ramirez, again in a voice-over, says that his mother always reassured him at the end of her stories, ""If the Devil is real, then God must be real too.""",10000000,"[{""id"": 27, ""name"": ""Horror""}, {""id"": 9648, ""name"": ""Mystery""}, {""id"": 53, ""name"": ""Thriller""}]",http://www.thenightchronicles.com/devil/,44040,"[{""id"": 2147, ""name"": ""claustrophobia""}, {""id"": 173316, ""name"": ""trapped in an elevator""}]",en,A group of people trapped in a elevator realizes that the devil is among them.,30.934688,"[{""name"": ""Universal Pictures"", ""id"": 33}, {""name"": ""Media Rights Capital"", ""id"": 2531}, {""name"": ""Night Chronicles"", ""id"": 6006}, {""name"": ""Relativity Media"", ""id"": 7295}]","[{""iso_3166_1"": ""US"", ""name"": ""United States of America""}]",1/13/2010,33583175,80,"[{""iso_639_1"": ""es"", ""name"": ""Espa\u00f1ol""}, {""iso_639_1"": ""en"", ""name"": ""English""}, {""iso_639_1"": ""uk"", ""name"": ""\u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0438\u0439""}]",Released,Bad Things Happen For A Reason,Devil,5.8,816,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.050698996,0.449301004,0,0,0.149767001,3.3583175
185,186,Diary of a Wimpy Kid,2011,/wiki/Diary_of_a_Wimpy_Kid_(film),"Greg Heffley, a small 11 year old who constantly fights with his teenage brother Rodrick and younger brother Manny, is apprehensive about beginning middle school. On his first day, he quickly discovers the ups and downs, such as the missing stall doors in the boys bathroom and the difficulties of obtaining a seat during lunch. During P.E. class, he and his best friend Rowley Jefferson escape from a game of Gladiator and learn about a rotten piece of cheese on the basketball court that makes anyone who touches it an outcast, known as the Cheese Touch. Greg also meets Angie, a girl who isolates herself from the other students to survive. Greg states his intention of becoming the most popular student in school. The next day, Greg signs up for wrestling but suffers back-to-back humiliating losses against Fregley, a weird outcast, and Patty Farrell, Gregs arch-enemy from elementary school. On Halloween, while out with Rowley, they encounter teenagers while trick or treating who spray a fire extinguisher at them. When Greg threatens to call the cops, the teenagers chase them to his Grandmas house, but Greg and Rowley escape.The boys join Safety Patrol in an effort to become popular, and they try out for a contest that offers a student a chance to become the new cartoonist for the school paper. After Greg breaks Rowleys arm during a game the boys played, Rowley becomes extremely popular, and wins the cartoonist contest, making Greg becomes jealous of him. During a Safety Patrol assignment, Greg panics when he encounters a truck identical to the teenagers from Halloween, and hides the kids in a construction zone. Greg is spotted by a neighbor who mistakes him for Rowley. To his own bewilderment, Rowley is suspended from the Patrol, but Greg eventually confesses to Rowley that he was the who was responsible. Upset and feeling betrayed that Greg didnt own up to his actions, Rowley berates Greg for not being a good friend and ends their friendship. Greg is eventually suspended from the Safety Patrol while Rowley is reinstated and makes friends with his classmate Collin, who replaces Greg as his new best friend. Greg decides to pursue popularity without Rowley by joining the schools production of The Wizard of Oz. At tryouts, Gregs soprano voice earns him the role of Dorothy; however, Patty threatens the teacher into casting her instead. Greg signs up as a tree, hoping to throw apples on Patty during the play, but during rehearsal, the trees are told they wont throw apples but sing a song instead. At the performance, Greg refuses to sing as Rodrick is videotaping the performance, and begins throwing apples after Patty throws a huge fit at what Greg has done, ending the play in chaos. Later, Greg and his mother attend a mother-son dance at the school despite his reluctance. At Susan’s encouragement, Greg attempts to reconcile with Rowley but is rejected. Depressed, he can only watch as Rowley and his mother perform a dance routine to Intergalactic, winning over the crowd and shocking Greg. One day at school, Rowley and Greg loudly confront each other. Patty and the other kids force Greg and Rowley to fight; however, neither of them are good at fighting.

On his first day, he quickly discovers the ups and downs, such as the missing stall doors in the boys bathroom and the difficulties of obtaining a seat during lunch. During P.E. class, he and his best friend Rowley Jefferson escape from a game of Gladiator and learn about a rotten piece of cheese on the basketball court that makes anyone who touches it an outcast, known as the Cheese Touch. Greg also meets Angie, a girl who isolates herself from the other students to survive. Greg states his intention of becoming the most popular student in school. The next day, Greg signs up for wrestling but suffers back-to-back humiliating losses against Fregley, a weird outcast, and Patty Farrell, Gregs arch-enemy from elementary school.

During a Safety Patrol assignment, Greg panics when he encounters a truck identical to the teenagers from Halloween, and hides the kids in a construction zone. Greg is spotted by a neighbor who mistakes him for Rowley. To his own bewilderment, Rowley is suspended from the Patrol, but Greg eventually confesses to Rowley that he was the who was responsible. Upset and feeling betrayed that Greg didnt own up to his actions, Rowley berates Greg for not being a good friend and ends their friendship. Greg is eventually suspended from the Safety Patrol while Rowley is reinstated and makes friends with his classmate Collin, who replaces Greg as his new best friend. Greg decides to pursue popularity without Rowley by joining the schools production of The Wizard of Oz. At tryouts, Gregs soprano voice earns him the role of Dorothy; however, Patty threatens the teacher into casting her instead.

188,189,Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules,2011,/wiki/Diary_of_a_Wimpy_Kid:_Rodrick_Rules_(film),"The Heffley family attends a party at a roller rink, where Greg reunites with his best friend Rowley Jefferson, meets a new girl at school named Holly Hills who Greg instantly has a crush on, and reveals he passed on the Cheese Touch. During the party, his older brother Rodrick embarrasses Greg by suggesting that he ask Holly to skate with him and then interfering with Couples Skate by persuading a crowd of violent teenagers to enter the rink, along with replacing ""Always"" by Atlantic Starr with a heavy metal song. This prompts Gregs parents, Frank and Susan (who misunderstand this) to speak to Greg on the rinks public address system and then carry him off the rink. Greg, extremely angry with Rodrick for humiliating him, tries to tackle him, but he misses and in turn, lands in a little girls birthday cake. She and her friends then furiously proceed to beat up Greg as the intro starts. On the morning of the first day of school, as Greg and Rodrick are about to leave, Susan makes an effort to have them bond by doing some things together by using her methods called ""Mom Bucks"", but it makes things worse as Rodrick cheats her system. At school, one of Gregs new teachers immediately dislikes him due to his relation to Rodrick, therefore making the teacher assume that Greg will be as bad. After school, a community talent show is advertised on TV; in which Rowley sees it as an opportunity to perform magic, and Rodrick sees it as a big break for his band, Löded Diper. However, Greg rejects the idea of doing the magic.At church, Greg and Rodrick are grounded after a scuffle, causing Susan to get upset about what others think of her, and her familys reputation being ruined; after which, they are forbidden to go to a family trip to a water park the following weekend, nor inviting people over, and told that they must bond. However, Rodrick defies his parents orders, and throws a party. Though, the party causes Rodrick to be more friendly and open towards Greg.The next morning, Susan calls and says that they will be home early. Rodrick and Greg hastily erase almost all the evidence, but find out that the bathroom door is vandalized with graffiti. They replace it, but Greg finds out that the replacement door doesnt have a lock like the last one. Rodrick convinces Greg to deny everything as their parents and younger brother, Manny arrive. Susan however, later slowly began to discover the difference and questions Greg and Rodrick. Though Rodrick denies this, Greg nearly reveals the truth and convinces Susan to not to punish Rodrick. Convinced that Greg didnt reveal about the party, Rodrick starts bonding with him as a gesture of gratitude.One night, after coming home from a night out, they are finally exposed when Frank comes across photos of the party and the Heffleys reputation is ruined again, and no one will support Susans articles about siblings bonding anymore. As Susan and Frank decide on the boys punishments, Greg tries to apologize to Rodrick, but Rodrick gets mad at him for getting them in trouble. As punishments, Greg and Rodrick both get grounded again, which includes Rodrick not being allowed to participate in the talent show. Completely devastated and heartbroken, Rodrick vows to get even with Greg. The final part of their punishment is they have to stay at their grandfathers retirement home, in which Greg finds out that Holly is visiting her grandmother. Holly tells Greg that she can relate to Greg about siblings giving her a hard time; however, siblings will eventually get over it. Holly also reveals she is more patient and mature than her two sisters.The next day, to humiliate Greg, Rodrick reads and steals Gregs diary — in which Greg has written about his crush on Holly — and attempts to hand it over to Holly. Greg, with only his underwear on, chases after Rodrick and takes the diary back, but he accidentally hides in the womens restroom and a group of angry women in the restroom think he is a ""peeping tom"" and they attempt to catch him, but fail. When Greg returns, Rodrick reveals to him that he taped the whole incident on a VHS tape from the security cameras in the retirement home.At the talent show a few nights later, Rodrick finds out that he has been booted from the band by Bill Walter, a band member who recently joined; Rowley isnt able to perform his magic tricks due to his assistant, Scotty Douglas, having stage fright. Greg, with a change of heart, helps Rowley and Rodrick out by participating in Rowleys magic act in return for allowing Rodrick to perform his band act. In the middle of the performance in the talent show, Rodrick banishes Bill from the band for what he did. Before dropping Greg off at school the next morning, Rodrick gives him the tape from the retirement home in return for making it possible for him to participate in the show, symbolizing that they are not only brothers, but also friends.In a mid-credits scene, Greg and Rowley have just finished posting the video that Frank shot of Rodricks music act with Susan dancing on YouTube, and it goes viral, making Greg and Rowley an internet sensation.

193,194,Django Unchained,2012,/wiki/Django_Unchained,"In 1858 Texas, brothers Ace and Dicky Speck drive a group of shackled black slaves on foot. Among them is Django, sold off and separated from his wife Broomhilda von Shaft, a house slave. The brothers are stopped by Dr. King Schultz, a German dentist-turned-bounty hunter who asks to buy one of the slaves. He questions Django about his knowledge of the Brittle brothers, a trio of outlaws for whom Schultz is carrying a warrant. When the suspicious Ace levels his gun at him, Schultz kills him with a fast draw and then kills Dickys horse, which falls and crushes Dickys leg. Schultz insists on paying Dicky a fair price for Django before leaving Dicky to the newly freed slaves, who kill him and follow the North Star to freedom. As Django can identify the Brittle brothers, Schultz offers him his freedom in exchange for help tracking them down.They track the Brittles to the Tennessee plantation of Spencer ""Big Daddy"" Bennett and kill them. Bennett musters a large gang to raid their camp in the night; Schultz ambushes them with an explosive, killing most of them while Django kills Bennett. Feeling morally obliged to Django, Schultz agrees to help him find and rescue Broomhilda. Schultz trains Django as his apprentice, and the two become partners. Django soon collects his first bounty, keeping the handbill for good luck.In 1859, Django and Schultz travel to Mississippi where they learn the identity of Broomhildas new owner: Calvin J. Candie, the charming but cruel owner of the Candyland plantation, where slaves are forced to fight to the death in brutal wrestling matches called ""Mandingo fights"". Schultz and Django meet Calvin at his gentlemans club in Greenville, and offer $12,000 for one of his best fighters; however, their ulterior motive is to purchase Broomhilda. Intrigued, Calvin invites them to Candyland.The group encounters Calvins slave trackers en route: cornering one of Calvins disfigured Mandingo fighters, DArtagnan, who tried to escape to avoid fighting again. Angered, Calvin has several attack dogs devour DArtagnan alive. After finding Broomhilda and telling her of their plan, Schultz offers to buy her while negotiating the initial deal during dinner. Calvins staunchly loyal house slave, Stephen, becomes suspicious and accurately deduces their plan. He alerts Calvin, who alters the deal at gunpoint so that Broomhilda will be sold for $12,000 instead of the Mandingo fighter. Schultz agrees, and the papers for her freedom are drawn up and signed. Calvin smugly insists that the deal be sealed through a handshake; Schultz, sick of Calvins cruelty, shoots him through the heart with his concealed derringer, killing him. Schultz is killed by Calvins bodyguard, who is then killed with his own revolver by Django. A shootout ensues, and Django kills many of Calvins henchmen. When he runs out of ammunition, Stephen tells Django to surrender or Broomhilda will be killed; he surrenders.The next morning, Stephen tells Django that Calvins sister Lara has taken charge, and that he will be sold to a mine and worked to death. En route, Django proves to his escorts that he is a bounty hunter by showing them his first handbill, tells them that the men on the handbill are back at Candyland, and promises them all but $500 of the reward money if they free him and help him kill the wanted men. The escorts release him and give him a revolver, which he immediately uses to kill them before stealing a horse and returning to Candyland with a bag of dynamite. Django kills Calvins slave trackers, takes Broomhildas freedom papers from Schultzs corpse, and frees his wife from a nearby cabin.When Calvins mourners return from his burial, Django kills Lara and the remaining henchmen, releases the two remaining house slaves, and kneecaps Stephen before igniting the dynamite that he has planted throughout the mansion. Django and Broomhilda watch from a distance as the mansion explodes, killing Stephen, before riding off together.",100000000,"[{""id"": 18, ""name"": ""Drama""}, {""id"": 37, ""name"": ""Western""}]",http://unchainedmovie.com/,68718,"[{""id"": 801, ""name"": ""bounty hunter""}, {""id"": 1701, ""name"": ""hero""}, {""id"": 3136, ""name"": ""plantation""}, {""id"": 3679, ""name"": ""society""}, {""id"": 6054, ""name"": ""friendship""}, {""id"": 9713, ""name"": ""friends""}, {""id"": 9748, ""name"": ""revenge""}, {""id"": 9823, ""name"": ""rivalry""}, {""id"": 10084, ""name"": ""rescue""}, {""id"": 10950, ""name"": ""shootout""}, {""id"": 12425, ""name"": ""racism""}, {""id"": 15017, ""name"": ""danger""}, {""id"": 33780, ""name"": ""dentist""}, {""id"": 160324, ""name"": ""django""}, {""id"": 163129, ""name"": ""dual role""}, {""id"": 179430, ""name"": ""aftercreditsstinger""}, {""id"": 187376, ""name"": ""odd couple""}, {""id"": 188772, ""name"": ""black slave""}, {""id"": 202703, ""name"": ""deadly""}, {""id"": 206687, ""name"": ""chases and races""}, {""id"": 207928, ""name"": ""19th century""}]",en,"With the help of a German bounty hunter, a freed slave sets out to rescue his wife from a brutal Mississippi plantation owner.",82.121691,"[{""name"": ""Columbia Pictures"", ""id"": 5}, {""name"": ""The Weinstein Company"", ""id"": 308}]","[{""iso_3166_1"": ""US"", ""name"": ""United States of America""}]",12/25/2012,425368238,165,"[{""iso_639_1"": ""en"", ""name"": ""English""}, {""iso_639_1"": ""fr"", ""name"": ""Fran\u00e7ais""}, {""iso_639_1"": ""de"", ""name"": ""Deutsch""}]",Released,"Life, liberty and the pursuit of vengeance.",Django Unchained,7.8,10099,0.185483724,0.091476619,0.140689671,0.156587899,-0.015898228,-0.049213052,0.094007105,0.053039461,4.25368238
194,195,Dolphin Tale,2011,/wiki/Dolphin_Tale,"Sawyer Nelson, a lonely 11-year-old boy, has fallen behind in school since being abandoned by his father five years earlier. His only friend is his cousin Kyle, a champion swimmer who hopes to compete in the Olympics. Kyle leaves to spend time in the army.One day on his way to summer school, Sawyer finds a fisherman attempting to help an injured dolphin tangled in a crab trap. The dolphin is taken for treatment to Clearwater Marine Aquarium (CMA), run by Doctor Clay Haskett. Clays daughter Hazel names the dolphin Winter, after two prior dolphins, Summer and Autumn, had been treated successfully and returned to the ocean. Sawyer sneaks in to see Winter, and later starts to visit each day, being harassed by a roof-dwelling pelican named Rufus. Their respective parents are initially hesitant (Clay since Sawyer does not have any experience with marine animals, and Sawyers mother, Lorraine, since Sawyer is skipping summer school without permission), but they realize that the friendship seems to benefit both Winter and Sawyer. Dr. Clay allows the visits to continue, and Lorraine withdraws Sawyer from summer school and lets him volunteer at CMA, and gives him a new wetsuit.However, Winters tail is damaged and must be amputated. Winter learns to swim without a tail by developing a side-to-side motion like a fish, but after an X-ray, Clay notices the unnatural motion is causing unnatural stress on her spine, which if continued will cripple and eventually kill her.News comes that Kyle has been injured in an explosion and is returning home for treatment. Sawyer is excited to see him, but devastated when Kyle, depressed, skips his own welcoming party and stays at the local Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, where Doctor Cameron McCarthy develops prosthetic limbs. Sawyer and his mother visit Kyle there, but Sawyer is affronted when Kyle asks them to leave. Not wanting to upset Sawyer, Kyle takes Sawyer for a walk and explains his situation and that he needs some time. Sawyer then asks Dr. McCarthy if he could make a prosthetic tail for Winter. McCarthy agrees to do so and convinces his prosthetic supplier Hanger Prosthetics and Orthotics to supply the parts at no cost. Dr. McCarthy manufactures a ""homemade"" model tail while waiting for the real one to arrive, but Winter rejects it by banging it against the pool wall. Meanwhile, Kyle gets more depressed when his friend and swimming partner, Donovan Peck, beats Kyles old swimming records. McCarthy persuades Kyle to go home.Then CMA, already in financial peril, is damaged by a hurricane. The board of directors agrees to close up and sell the land to a real estate developer, and find homes for all the animals except Winter; due to her condition she is not wanted, and may have to be put down. Kyle visits CMH and sees that Winter is like him, with a damaged limb. However, inspired by a girl with a prosthetic limb from Atlanta, Georgia, who comes to visit Winter, Sawyer imagines holding a ""Save Winter Day"" to save the facility. Clay is not convinced, but he reconsiders after talking with his father, Reed. Kyle agrees to race Donovan Peck and persuades Bay News 9 to cover the event.The Hanger-supplied tail finally arrives; however, Winter rejects it too. Sawyer then realizes what the real problem is: the plastic base for the tail is irritating her skin. Therefore, McCarthy develops an alternative gel-like sock which he calls ""Winters Gel"" (which is the real name of the Hanger product used to attach prosthetic limbs, developed during research with Winter). Winter accepts this new prosthetic tail.At Save Winter Day, the work with Winter impresses everyone. Sawyers teacher gives him school credit, allowing him to pass summer school. The fisherman who found Winter on the beach comes too. The real estate developer decides to keep CMH open and to support it financially.

196,197,Dolphin Tale 2,2014,/wiki/Dolphin_Tale_2,"Three years after saving Winter, Sawyer, now aged fourteen, gets a chance for a scholarship to the elite SEA Semester program, which involves three months at sea doing marine mammal research, after impressing his cousin Kyles advisor Dr. Miguel Arroyo when champion surfer Bethany Hamilton swims with him and Winter. Sawyer is reluctant to go because he is concerned about leaving Winter.Winter needs attention and shows signs of stress and loneliness, especially after her older companion, Panama, dies. George Hatton, a USDA inspector, insists that Winter must be matched with a new companion within 30 days or be transferred elsewhere. However, Winters behavior has become unpredictable, even dangerous: when Sawyer tries to get her out of the tank to prepare to make her a new prosthetic tail, she becomes aggressive and knocks him into the water. Dr. Clay prohibits Sawyer from swimming with Winter. Winter spends weeks in isolation, and despite people not being allowed to visit her, Sawyer allows Susie, a new volunteer, and her grandfather to see her; Hazel becomes slightly jealous, because she has feelings for him.Prior to these events, CMA rescues a severely sunburned beached dolphin, named Mandy after a little girl who finds her, which Sawyer, Clay, and Hazel hope will become Winters companion. CMA begins to rehabilitate Mandy, contemplating releasing her soon. Clay, Sawyer, and Hazel test her readiness by giving Mandy three live fish, which she catches effortlessly, so they decide they must release her.Sawyer and Hazel break the rules and swim with Winter, who appears to be feeling better. Clay finds them doing so and scolds them, but then states that it does not matter, because George issued an order that Winter be transferred to a marine park in Texas. Meanwhile, Sawyer wins the scholarship to attend the SEA Semester, so his mother Lorraine and friends arrange a party, which cheers him up a little; but he still cannot decide whether to go. Dr. McCarthy shows him an old watch which must be tapped to keep ticking, and so encourages Sawyer to ""shake it up now and then"" and try new things in life.During the party, Clay hears that another female dolphin has been rescued; one so young that she has not yet learned how to hunt and cannot return to the wild. This offers new hope of companionship for Winter, so they name her ""Hope"". In addition, Sawyer and Hazel find and rescue a sea turtle from some fishing line. Rufus becomes obsessed with the sea turtle, named Mavis, following her everywhere, even watching her during a CT Scan at the hospital where Lorraine works. As Mavis is released, Rufus follows her out to sea.George gives Clay an extension to keep Winter from being transferred, and CMA tries to introduce Hope as her new companion. Hope panics and circles the pool at high speed, and staff quickly separate the two dolphins. They realize that Hope had sensed that Winter had no tail and moved differently from other dolphins. Sawyer thinks that a new prosthetic tail might have better results.In her second meeting with Hope, Winter wears the new tail designed by Dr. McCarthy. A huge crowd, including George, is present to watch, and eventually the two dolphins accept each other. Everyone rejoices that Winter can stay at CMA now that she has a companion. With his uncertainty about Winter resolved, Sawyer decides to go to the SEA Semester program, but reassures her that he will be back. Hazel says goodbye to him by releasing helium balloons and holding up a sign, and Sawyer sends her a text message saying, ""Thanks, Hazel. Youre the best!"", causing her to blush as she smiles to herself and Rufus returns to the aquarium.Real-life footage shown at the end includes Mandys actual release, Hopes rescue, a sea turtle named Mavis and her release, Winter wearing the new prosthetic tail, and amputees interacting with Winter.",36000000,"[{""id"": 10751, ""name"": ""Family""}, {""id"": 18, ""name"": ""Drama""}]",http://www.seewinter.com/,227735,"[{""id"": 630, ""name"": ""dolphin""}, {""id"": 2269, ""name"": ""aquarium""}, {""id"": 15058, ""name"": ""swimming""}]",en,The team of people who saved Winter's life reassemble in the wake of her surrogate mother's passing in order to find her a companion so she can remain at the Clearwater Marine Hospital.,6.967857,"[{""name"": ""Alcon Entertainment"", ""id"": 1088}, {""name"": ""Color Force"", ""id"": 5420}, {""name"": ""Boxing Cat Films"", ""id"": 12626}, {""name"": ""St. Petersburg Clearwater Film Commission"", ""id"": 68621}]","[{""iso_3166_1"": ""US"", ""name"": ""United States of America""}]",9/12/2014,52424533,107,"[{""iso_639_1"": ""en"", ""name"": ""English""}]",Released,WINTER's amazing true story... now has HOPE.,Dolphin Tale 2,6.7,96,0.5,0.5,0.24766162,0.147875458,0.099786162,0.25233838,0,0.117374847,1.456237028

203,204,Drive,2011,/wiki/Drive_(2011_film),"An unnamed mechanic, who is a stunt driver and criminal-for-hire getaway car driver, lives in the Echo Park neighborhood of Los Angeles. His getaway driver jobs are all managed by auto shop owner Shannon, who persuades Jewish mobsters Bernie Rose and Nino to invest in a car for the Driver to race. Shannon promises them a large portion of the proceeds if the Driver wins. The Driver meets his neighbor Irene and her young son Benicio, growing closer as he spends more time with them. Their budding relationship is interrupted when Irenes husband, Standard Gabriel, is released from prison.Standard owes protection money from his time in prison and is beaten up by Albanian gangster Cook. The latter demands that Standard rob a pawnshop to pay off the debt. Cook gives Benicio a bullet as a symbol that he and his mother are in danger, which the Driver takes after seeing Benicio fidgeting with it. The Driver, concerned for the safety of Irene and Benicio, offers to act as the getaway driver for Standard in the pawnshop robbery. Cook assigns them Blanche, one of his female associates, to assist them in the robbery.The Driver finds and steals a 2011 Mustang GT for the job. The heist goes awry when the pawnshop owner shoots and kills Standard after Blanche returns to the car with the money in a duffel bag. Pursued by an unrelated mysterious adversary, the Driver and Blanche undergo an intense car chase before escaping with the money. The Driver hides with Blanche in a motel, where he learns from a news report that the pawnshop owner claims that Standard performed the robbery by himself and that no money had been stolen. The Driver slaps and threatens to beat Blanche when he suspects her to be lying about being oblivious to the second car. She admits that the bag contains a million dollars and that she and Cook planned to re-steal the money for themselves by using the car that chased them. Two of Cooks men ambush them in their room and kill Blanche before the Driver kills them both.At the auto shop, Shannon offers to hide the money, but the Driver refuses. He hunts down Cook in a strip club, smashes his fingers with a hammer, threatens to kill him, and forcefeeds him the bullet that was given to Benicio. Cook reveals that Nino was behind the robbery. The Driver decides to return the money, but Nino dismisses the offer and instead sends a hitman to the Drivers apartment building. The Driver discloses his part in Standards job and asks Irene to run away with him and the money, but she slaps him in anger at her husbands death and the Drivers involvement. Entering the elevator with her, the Driver encounters the hitman. He kisses Irene and brutally beats the hitman to death, leaving her stunned and horrified. Surprised that Nino knows his address, the Driver confronts Shannon, who reveals that he had also unwittingly mentioned Irene. The Driver advises Shannon to flee for his safety.At the pizzeria, Nino reveals to Bernie that the pawnshop money belonged to a low-level Philadelphia mobster who was making inroads into their territory. Bernie insults Cook and scolds Nino for stealing from the East Coast Italian Mafia, noting that their lives will be in danger if word of their involvement gets out. Nino, however, is tired of being patronized and insulted by the Italian-American mobsters. Bernie finds the steady flow of money a redeeming quality in dealing with the East Coast mob, but Nino uses that argument to further his point: that they must kill everyone tied to the robbery, including the Driver and Shannon. Bernie promptly murders Cook with cutlery from the pizzeria, showing he accepts Ninos plan.

204,205,Paranormal Activity,2010,/wiki/Paranormal_Activity,"Young couple Katie and Micah move to a new house in San Diego. Katie claims an evil presence has been haunting her since she was a child, so Micah sets up a camera in their bedroom to record any paranormal activity that occurs while they sleep. A famous psychic Dr. Fredrichs, who reveals that Katie is being haunted by a demon that feeds off of negative energy and is intent on tormenting Katie,  advises them not to communicate with the demon and to contact demonologist Dr. Johann Averies if needed. Katie seems interested, but Micah does not take this seriously.The camera manages to capture many strange occurrences, which are minor at first, such as noises, flickering lights, and doors moving on their own. However, Micah taunts and mocks the demon, worsening the situation. During the thirteenth night, the demon angrily screeches and there is a loud thud, causing the entire house to vibrate. Voice recorder tests are conducted by Micah the following morning, which reveal demonic grunting when Micah asks if it would like to use a Ouija board. During the fifteenth night, Katie, in an apparent trance, stands beside the bed and stares at Micah for two hours before going outside. Micah tries to convince Katie to go back inside, but she refuses and appears to remember none of it the next day.Micah brings home a Ouija board, which infuriates Katie. When they leave the house, the camera records an unseen force moving the planchette to form an unknown message on the Ouija board, which then spontaneously catches fire. Katie sees the video and pleads with Micah to contact the demonologist, but again he refuses. During the seventeenth night, Micah sprinkles baby powder in the hallway and outside the bedroom door. The couple are awakened by creaks, and find non-human footprints leading to the attic, where Micah finds a burnt photograph of a young Katie (same picture from the second film). Katie finally calls the demonologist, Dr. Averies, but he is out of the country.The events of the seventeenth night have psychologically terrified the couple, which in turn has strengthened the demon. Over the next few nights, the paranormal activity is excessive and intense. They eventually call Dr. Fredrichs back to the house, but he is overwhelmed by the demonic energy upon entering. He apologetically leaves despite their pleas, stating that his presence only makes the demon angrier. The bleak reality causes the couple to lose all hope, which makes the demon strong enough to be able to pull Katie out of the bedroom and bite her, causing her to become fully possessed. Micah discovers the bite mark and—deciding events are too out of control to remain in the house—he packs to head to a motel. Just as they are set to leave, the possessed Katie insists they will be okay now.The following night, Katie gets out of bed and stares at Micah for two hours before going downstairs. After a moment of silence, Katie screams for Micah; he abruptly rushes to help her. Afterward, Micah exclaims in pain, Katie stops screaming, and then heavy footsteps are heard coming upstairs. Suddenly, Micahs body is violently hurled at the camera, which is knocked off the tripod, revealing a demonic Katie standing in the doorway. She slowly walks into the room, stained with blood, and crawls to Micahs body, then looks up at the camera with a grin. As she lunges toward the camera, her face takes on a demonic appearance just as the scene cuts to black.

204,205,Drive Angry,2011,/wiki/Drive_Angry,"John Milton (Nicolas Cage) is an undead criminal who has escaped Hell and stolen Satans gun, labeled the Godkiller, to kill Jonah King (Billy Burke), a cult leader who tricked Miltons daughter into joining his followers in the wake of Miltons death ten years prior, only to kill her and her husband and steal their daughter (Miltons granddaughter) to be sacrificed in a Satanist ritual. King believes that if he kills the baby, he will unleash Hell over Earth.After interrogating and murdering some of Kings followers, Milton discovers that the ritual will take place in Stillwater, an abandoned prison in Louisiana. He heads there, but stops by a diner, where he meets Piper (Amber Heard), a waitress. Miltons car is damaged in the pursuit, so he sabotages Pipers car, a 1969 blue Dodge Charger R/T 440 and follows her to fix it in exchange for a ride on the way to Stillwater to find King.Entering her room, Piper walks in on her boyfriend, Frank (Todd Farmer), having sex with another woman. Piper beats the woman and assaults Frank, getting knocked to the ground. Milton, in a phone booth nearby, hears the commotion and comes to Pipers aid, kicking Frank in the face as he is about to continue assaulting Piper, and punching Frank repeatedly. Milton steals his car, taking Piper along with him driving to Stillwater. Meanwhile, a supernatural operative of Satan, The Accountant (William Fichtner), arrives on Earth with the mission to bring Milton back to Hell and take the gun back. After interrogating Frank, he discovers that Milton and Piper are heading to Louisiana, and murders Frank with a bat before tricking a pair of state troopers into helping him by impersonating an FBI agent.At a shady hotel, Milton is attacked by King and his men, who heard about his return, but he kills most of them. The Accountant appears with the police and chases after Milton and Piper, who are chasing after Kings van. Milton uses the Godkiller to shoot the Accountant out of the road. They then follow King to a church, only to find it filled with Kings followers. They are ambushed and captured. Piper is kidnapped and Milton is shot in the eye and left for dead, but he awakens and kills Kings men before pursuing the RV once again. Inside, Piper breaks free and fights King before jumping out of the RV and onto Miltons car. King then disables the car by repeatedly shooting its engine.Milton and Piper then meet Miltons friend Webster (David Morse), who provides them a new car, a 1971 red Chevrolet Chevelle SS. Piper discovers that Milton is undead and had to abandon his daughter to protect her from his former companions, which is why she was so easily manipulated by King. Webster reveals that Milton died 10 years prior in a shootout, and that Webster personally carried his coffin. She also discovers that the Godkiller was stolen by Milton from Satan and has the power to completely destroy ones soul, preventing it from going to either Heaven or Hell. After arming himself, Milton tells Piper that he cannot guarantee her safety and that she should leave, but she assures him that she has never had a worthy cause to fight for until now, and that she is with him regardless of the consequences. Milton tells Webster to stay behind, not wishing him to die. With the help of the Accountant, they evade the troops of Sheriff Cap (Tom Atkins) and finally arrive at Stillwater. The Accountant captures Piper and forces Milton to give up the Godkiller before he can engage King, but he allows Milton to go into battle against King and his followers to save his granddaughter, noting that Satan is more of a well-educated, calm warden of a very large prison, rather than the face of evil, and that he actually despises the sacrifices of innocent lives in his name.While Milton slaughters Kings men before they can sacrifice the child, Piper escapes The Accountants clutches with the Godkiller. King eventually gets the upper hand on Milton and savagely beats him. Piper fires the Godkiller at King, but misses and hits one of his few surviving men instead. She is knocked out by the guns recoil. King orders one of his female servants to murder the child. However, the woman, who had been caring for the baby ever since King stole her, finds herself unable to carry out the deed, making King angry. The Accountant attracts Kings attention, allowing Milton to grab the Godkiller and shoot King, destroying his soul. The Accountant retrieves the baby and allows Milton to say goodbye to her. Milton gives her to Piper, who promises to care for and protect her. Webster arrives and looks on as Milton ""dies"". After both Piper and Webster have left, Milton is revealed to still not be fully dead and with the Accountant. Following this, Milton makes good on his earlier promise to Webster, and nonchalantly drinks a beer out of what is left of Kings skull. He agrees to go back to Hell, but warns that if he is punished too severely for his actions, he will escape again. The Accountant claims that he looks forward to it, insinuating that chasing Milton is the most fun he has ever had, before he wiggles his keys and manifests a black 1957 Chevrolet Bel Air. He throws the keys to Milton, who drives off into the gates of Hell.",50000000,"[{""id"": 14, ""name"": ""Fantasy""}, {""id"": 53, ""name"": ""Thriller""}, {""id"": 28, ""name"": ""Action""}, {""id"": 80, ""name"": ""Crime""}]",http://www.driveangry3d.com/,47327,"[{""id"": 4479, ""name"": ""bone""}, {""id"": 41019, ""name"": ""car explosion""}, {""id"": 159631, ""name"": ""premarital sex""}, {""id"": 163055, ""name"": ""satanic cult""}, {""id"": 172345, ""name"": ""driver's license""}, {""id"": 172353, ""name"": ""finger gun""}, {""id"": 172354, ""name"": ""backhand slap""}, {""id"": 172357, ""name"": ""car jump""}, {""id"": 172364, ""name"": ""man punching a woman""}, {""id"": 172365, ""name"": ""magic trick""}]",en,"Milton is a hardened felon who has broken out of Hell, intent on finding the vicious cult who brutally murdered his daughter and kidnapped her baby.

208,209,Dylan Dog: Dead of Night,2011,/wiki/Dylan_Dog:_Dead_of_Night,"In New Orleans, Dylan Dog, an ace detective whose specialty is paranormal cases, narrates how he helped people with their cases until his wife, Cassandra, was killed by vampires. Since then he has been doing regular cases with his ""partner"", Marcus Deckler.One night, when teenager Elizabeth Ryan calls her father, without getting an answer, she goes to her fathers room and finds him dead on the floor. She is then surprised, and almost attacked, by a strange, hairy, creature. The next day, Dylan is informed, by Marcus, that Elizabeth asked for (and later hires) him. When Dylan interrogates her, she explains that he is the only one that can help her and shows to him a card (that is his old detective card) that says ""No pulse?, No problem"". Dylan sees it, stands up and goes out, stating that he doesnt ""do that"" any more, followed by Marcus.That night Marcus is attacked and killed by an unknown creature (who Dylan thinks is the same creature that killed Elizabeths father). Dylan decides to officially help Elizabeth with her case. He retrieves an old forensics kit from under the floorboards of his office and rides to Elizabeths house. After finding a hair sample in the tree outside her fathers study, he tells Elizabeth that the creature that killed her father is a female, eighteen- to nineteen-year-old werewolf, who is a member of the Cysnos werewolf clan. Dylan visits the Cysnos leader, Gabriel - an old friend of his - and realizes that Gabriels 19-year-old daughter Mara might be his main suspect, an idea that makes Gabriel very angry. After he is told off by Gabriel, Dylan is attacked by Gabriels older son Wolfgang who is then knocked unconscious by Dylan (who was using a silver gauntlet).Dylan then finds Mara dead in a warehouse and is briefly attacked by an unknown vampire. He then goes to Elizabeth in order to determine what connections may exist between those involved. She shows him a book of artifacts her father imported and indicates that one of the items pictured is now missing after having been smuggled into the country. The same vampire from earlier attacks Dylan and Elizabeth at her home along with two others demanding ""The Heart."" Dylan fends them off long enough for them to make an escape and continue the investigation.Dylan then goes to the morgue (which is run by zombies) to see Marcuss wound and discovers that Marcus has been turned into a zombie (and he also has a missing arm). Marcus initially doesnt believe Dylan, but finally accepts his condition after Dylan shoots him to prove it. Dylan then takes both Marcus and Elizabeth to ""the body shop"", which is a black market for body parts. While Marcus looks for a new arm, Dylan talks with the owner and is informed that the vampires, led by Vargas, are after an artifact known as ""The heart"". Dylan then goes to the Corpus House, a nightclub owned by Vargas. He talks to Vargas, an arrogant young vampire who denies being involved with the murders and tells Dylan to go while he still lets him to do so.Dylan then visits his old vampire friend, Borelli. Borelli tells Dylan that the artifact known as ""The heart"" is called ""The heart of Belial"", a cross-like relic that holds the blood of Belial, an ancient monster who cannot be killed unless his/her master is destroyed. After he finds the heart in the tomb of vampire elder known as Sclavi, Dylan is ambushed by Vargas men. After he awakens, Vargas traps him and Marcus inside the crypt, and takes the Heart. Before sealing the pair up, Vargas reveals that he was the one who killed Cassandra years ago, thus provoking Dylan to kill the vampire elders and leave Vargas in charge. After Marcus digs himself out and releases Dylan, the duo goes after Vargas who has taken Elizabeth to the Corpus House. Vargas reveals to Elizabeth that he intends to turn her into a vampire and inject the blood of Belial into her. Dylan enters the Corpus House and finds that both Vargas and Elizabeth are gone.On his way to find Elizabeth and Vargas, Dylan realizes that Elizabeth is the real enemy and wants to turn Vargas into Belial as a revenge for her fathers murder. She tells him that the reason is not revenge, instead she explains that her family - an organization of monster hunters - are the ""good guys"" and that the ""monsters"" (vampires, werewolves, zombies, etc.) must be destroyed. Dylan says that she is wrong and that she is the monster. She injects the blood into Vargass body and escapes, but before she can do so she is attacked by Marcus who is knocked down by her. Dylan fights off Belial (who is slowly taking over Vargass body) when Elizabeth tries to stop Belial from killing Dylan, claiming he should do as she says because she is its master. Belial states the anyone who stops him, including his master, is his enemy. After knocking her away, Belial continues after Dylan while Elizabeth escapes while Wolfgang (who was called by Dylan before the battle) and his werewolf allies attack Elizabeth. They manage to subdue and kill Elizabeth, and at the same time Belial dies in front of Dylan leaving Vargass unconscious body. Dylan gives the heart to Wolfgang, the only one that Dylan can trust to protect it, and goes with Marcus.Finally, Dylan decides to revive his paranormal detective agency.

211,212,Easy A,2010,/wiki/Easy_A,"The story is narrated by Olive Penderghast, a 17-year-old girl living in Ojai, California, speaking into her webcam.Olive lies to her best friend Rhiannon Abernathy about going on a date in order to get out of camping with Rhiannons hippie parents. Instead, she hangs around the house all weekend listening to Natasha Bedingfields ""Pocketful of Sunshine"", which is played by a musical greeting card from her grandmother. The following Monday, pressed by Rhiannon, Olive lies about losing her virginity to a college guy. Marianne Bryant, a girl with a devout Christian faith whom Olive considers to be prissy, overhears her telling the lie and soon it spreads like wildfire. The schools church group run by Marianne decides Olive will be their next project. Olive confides the truth to her friend Brandon, and he understands because others bully him because of his homosexuality. He later asks Olive to pretend to sleep with him so that he will be accepted by everyone as a ""straight stud"".Olive agrees to help him and they pretend to have sex at a party. After a fight with Rhiannon over her new identity as a ""dirty skank"", Olive decides to counteract the harassment by embracing her new image as the school tramp. She begins to wear more provocative clothing and, inspired by The Scarlet Letter (which her literature class is currently studying), stitches a red ""A"" onto everything. Boys who usually have had no luck with girls in the past now beg Olive to increase their popularity by saying they have had sex with her, in exchange for gift cards to various stores. This in turn increases her reputation. Things get worse when Micah, Mariannes boyfriend  who has had to repeat several grades, contracts chlamydia from sleeping with Mrs. Griffith, the school guidance counsellor, and blames it all on Olive. As Mr. Griffith is her favorite teacher, Olive agrees to the lie to spare his marriage.Mariannes friends from the church youth group, which now includes Rhiannon, begin harassing Olive in order to get her to leave school. After an ill-fated date with Anson, a boy who wants to pay her to actually sleep with him and not just pretend she did, Olive reconnects with Todd, her old love interest, who is also the schools mascot. Todd tells her that he does not believe the rumors because he remembers when she lied for him when he was not ready for his first kiss years ago.Olive now has a change of heart and begins to ask everyone she lied for to help her out by telling the truth, but Brandon and Micah have abruptly left town, and with their newfound popularity, no one else wants to tell. When Mrs. Griffith also refuses to tell the truth, Olive threatens to expose her affair, but Mrs. Griffith says no one would believe her.  Out of spite, Olive then immediately tells Mr. Griffith, who believes her and separates from his wife.After a friendly talk with her open-minded mother Rosemary, Olive comes up with a plan to finally get everything out in the open. She does a song-and-dance number at a school pep rally to get peoples attention to watch her via webcast—the film. The various boys whose reputations Olive helped improve are watching; Olive texts Rhiannon, apologizing for lying to her.

216,217,Edge of Tomorrow,2014,/wiki/Edge_of_Tomorrow_(film),"In 2015, an alien race called Mimics arrive in Germany to storm and conquer continental Europe. In 2020, the United Defense Force (UDF) achieves one solid victory over the Mimics at Verdun. In Britain, General Brigham of the UDF commands Major William Cage to cover a massive assault on France. Cage, who has no combat experience, objects and threatens to put the blame on Brigham should the invasion result in failure. Brigham has Cage arrested for disobeying orders and orders him sent to Heathrow Airport, now a military base. Cage wakes up to find Brigham has falsified records to make it appear he is only a private and has assigned him to the misfit J squad under the command of Master Sergeant Farell.The invasion of France is a colossal failure for the UDF. During the battle, Cage uses a Claymore mine to kill an unusually large blue Mimic but dies when the aliens blood dissolves him. Cage is jolted awake and finds himself back at Heathrow experiencing the events of the previous morning over again. Cage attempts to warn Farell that the invasion will fail but is not believed. He repeats the loop of dying on the beach and waking at Heathrow over and over again, becoming more skilled in combat each time. During one time loop Cage unsuccessfully attempts to save the life of Sergeant Rita Vrataski, who realises that Cage can loop time. She orders him to locate her the next time he wakes up.Cage reawakens and locates Vrataski, who takes him to Dr. Carter. Carter is an expert in Mimic biology and explains that Mimics are a superorganism in which the ""Omega"" controls the cerebrum, while the ""Alphas"" behave as the ganglia in which the Omega controls ordinary Mimics. If an Alpha is terminated, the Omega resets the day and rearranges its tactics until the battle is won. Cage inadvertently ""hijacked"" their ability to reset time through his exposure to an Alphas blood. Vrataski had this ability at Verdun, using it to win the battle before losing its power when she was wounded in battle and received a blood transfusion. She tells Cage to locate and kill the Omega in order to end the alien invasion and save the human race.Over many more loops Vrataski trains Cage to excel in combat. After one frustrating lesson Cage visits London and discovers that the Mimics will attack there after defeating the UDF in France. Cage also begins having visions of the dam in Germany that the Omega is hiding in. Cage and Vrataski spend many loops figuring out how to escape the invasion and reach the dam. Cage comes to know Vrataski and falls in love with her, but Vrataski is only interested in the mission. Upon reaching a point where she is killed whatever they do, Cage decides to fly to the dam on his own. Inside the dam, instead of finding the Omega, he is ambushed by an Alpha and Mimic who attempt to strip him of his ability to reset time. Cage preserves the ability by deliberately drowning himself.Cage and Vrataski infiltrate the MoD to obtain a prototype device built by Carter that can locate the Omega. Cage compels General Brigham to give him the device, and during the ensuing car chase discovers that the Omega is under the Louvre Pyramid in Paris. Cage is captured and seriously injured; he wakes up in a hospital to find he has been given a blood transfusion and has lost the ability to loop time.Vrataski frees Cage and they recruit J squad to help destroy the Omega before the invasion begins. They fly to Paris, where the other soldiers sacrifice themselves so that Cage and Vrataski can get into the Louvre. Just before luring away an Alpha standing between them and the submerged Omega, Vrataski kisses Cage to thank him for getting her as far as he did. The Alpha kills Vrataski and mortally wounds Cage, but he manages to drop a belt of grenades that kill the Omega.The dying Cage floats down through the water, into the Omegas blood. He awakens en route to his first meeting with Brigham, who is announcing on TV that Mimic activity has ceased following a mysterious energy surge in Paris. Cage, still a major, goes to Heathrow and finds Vrataski. She greets him as icily as she did in previous loops, causing Cage to chuckle.",178000000,"[{""id"": 28, ""name"": ""Action""}, {""id"": 878, ""name"": ""Science Fiction""}]",http://www.edgeoftomorrowmovie.com/,137113,"[{""id"": 563, ""name"": ""deja vu""}, {""id"": 1521, ""name"": ""time warp""}, {""id"": 2062, ""name"": ""restart""}, {""id"": 4565, ""name"": ""dystopia""}, {""id"": 6091, ""name"": ""war""}, {""id"": 9951, ""name"": ""alien""}, {""id"": 11109, ""name"": ""military officer""}, {""id"": 13065, ""name"": ""soldier""}, {""id"": 14909, ""name"": ""alien invasion""}, {""id"": 204318, ""name"": ""exoskeleton""}]",en,"Major Bill Cage is an officer who has never seen a day of combat when he is unceremoniously demoted and dropped into combat.

225,226,Escape from Planet Earth,2013,/wiki/Escape_from_Planet_Earth,"Scorch Supernova (Brendan Fraser) is a heroic alien on a mission to rescue captured babies from the Gnarlachs. He rescues them just in time before the Gnarlachs wake up. Scorch returns to Planet Baab where he is known as a famous hero and works at BASA with his older brother Gary (Rob Corddry). Garys son Kip (Jonathan Morgan Heit) is a big fan of his uncle Scorch. Soon, Gary receives a message from Lena Thackleman (Jessica Alba), the head of BASA, that Scorch will be sent to the ""Dark Planet"" (the Baabians name for Earth) due to a SOS call. Scorch decides to go to the Dark Planet, as he already made a press conference and contacted his sponsors. However, Gary opposes as Scorch is not serious and no alien has ever returned from the Dark Planet. After further arguing, Gary finally says that he wont be helping Scorch and quits BASA before Scorch himself fires him. Gary then goes home to his wife Kira (Sarah Jessica Parker) and Kip only to find out that Scorch has already gone to the Dark Planet, while Kip is watching it on live TV in excitement.Scorch arrives on Earth and lands in the desert and finds a 7-Eleven convenience store but mistakes an airdancer for a dying being. Scorch is then tranquilized and captured by Shanker Saunderson (William Shatner), the malevolent general of the US Army, and is taken to ""Area 51"" where aliens from other planets are held. Knowing that this has happened, Kip wants to go rescue Scorch but Gary discourages him. Kip is angry and goes to his room. Gary goes to Kips room to apologize only to find him going to try and save Scorch. He rushes to BASA with Kira wearing his rocket boots. They arrive to find Kip is about to take off in a ship.Gary manages to cancel the launch sequence at the last minute, but re-activates the sequence so he himself can rescue Scorch. As soon as he arrives, his ship immediately activates a self-destruct sequence, but Gary manages to escape. He arrives at the same store that Scorch arrived at earlier. Gary enters the store, but is spotted by its two owners Hawk (Steve Zahn) and Hammer (Chris Parnell). Although both feared Gary, the two men realize that Gary isnt hostile and offer him a Slurpee giving Gary a brain freeze. Afterwards, Shankers men break into the store, tranquilzes Hawk and Hammer, and capture Gary, taking him to Area 51.Gary is taken to Shankers office where he is quickly removed after Shanker receives an incoming call from Lena whos revealed to be an ally of Shankers as she has sent him a powerful source known as ""blubonium"". Gary is placed in a cell hall with other alien geniuses including Doc (Craig Robinson), Io (Jane Lynch), and Thurman (George Lopez) who tell Gary that various human technology has been invented by them for Shanker to rip off and sell to all of Earth so he will release them from Area 51. With these technologies, Shanker had made deals with companies like Apple Inc., Facebook, Google, and Pixar. Gary reunites with Scorch, but is again annoyed by his conceited behavior. After a food fight in the cafeteria, the aliens make their way to ""the peace shield."" Meanwhile, Lena captures Kira, who stayed at BASA and tried contacting Gary on his rescue mission. Lena then reveals her plan to give a lifetime supply of blubonium to Shanker.After Shanker reveals the blubonium, Gary unintentionally provokes Scorch into stealing it after stating its dangerous power. While being chased, Scorch destroys the blubonium, causing Shanker to freeze him and orders Gary to fix the blubonium and reveals that hes going to destroy all alien planets in the universe with a laser ray using the blubonium. Shanker thinks that all aliens are hostile just because a trio of grey aliens spaceship (accidentally) killed his father (Michael Dobson) in 1947. Gary fixes the ray with help from his new friends, but Shanker goes back on his promise and freezes him instead. The other aliens discover Shankers true intentions when he tries to destroy Baab with the laser ray and mutiny, knocking out Shankers henchmen. It is revealed that Gary did not put the machine together completely and it malfunctions, destroying itself before it can destroy Baab. With Gary and Scorch released from their icy prisons by the machine alongside the other frozen aliens, the brothers, Doc, Thurman, and Io escape Area 51. With help from Hawk and Hammer, Gary and company locate Scorchs spaceship in a trailer park.Meanwhile, back on Baab, Kip frees his mother Kira, who stops and subdues Lena after the latter took off with the blubonium shipment. US Air Force jets chase Garys saucer, but Kip guides him through and manages to evade and destroy the jets. However, Shanker, wearing Scorchs robotic suit, uses a tractor beam to stop the ship in midair. Gary and Scorch jump out and manage to get the suit off Shanker which causes them all to fall to their doom. While freefalling, Scorch and Gary reconcile before they and an unconscious Shanker are rescued by the grey aliens. After Gary knocks out Shanker, the grey aliens take the latter away to deal with him.Scorch, Gary, Doc, Thurman and Io return to Planet Baab where Gary is reunited with his family. Scorch is greeted as a hero, but gives the credit to his brother which the citizens of Baab celebrate. Scorch then embarks on his toughest mission yet: marrying his girlfriend, Gabby Babblebrook (Sofía Vergara).

226,227,Escape Plan,2013,/wiki/Escape_Plan_(film),"Ray Breslin is a former prosecutor who co-owns Breslin-Clark, a Los Angeles–based security firm specializing in testing the reliability of maximum security prisons. He spends his life getting into prisons to study their designs and the guards habits to find and exploit their weaknesses, thus enabling him to escape without a hitch or a victim. His goal is to ensure that criminals sent to prison stay inside by eliminating the weakness of every prison; Breslins wife and child were murdered by an escaped convict he had successfully prosecuted.Breslin and his business partner Lester Clark are offered a multimillion-dollar deal by CIA lawyer Jessica Mayer to test a top-secret, off-grid prison housing disappeared persons and see if it is escape-proof. However, this time around, he and his colleagues are not allowed to know where the prison is, as this helps minimize the risk of outside help when escaping. Breslin goes against all his own rules and agrees to the deal, allowing himself to be captured in New Orleans, Louisiana, under the guise of a Spanish terrorist named ""Anthony Portos."" However, the plan goes awry when his captors remove a tracking microchip from his arm and drug him on the way to the prison, which stops his colleagues from knowing where he has been taken.Breslin wakes up in a complex of glass cells with no outside windows to indicate the prisons location. He discovers that he has been played when he realizes the warden is not the one he is supposed to meet. He meets fellow inmate Emil Rottmayer, who works for a man named Victor Mannheim who is portrayed as a modern-day Robin Hood. The duo stage a fight for Breslin to study the solitary confinement cell, which uses high-powered halogen lights to disorient and dehydrate prisoners. Seeing that the cell floors have rivets that are made of steel instead of moisture-resistant aluminium, Breslin has Rottmayer acquire a metal plate from Warden Hobbess office floor, before the two of them and Muslim inmate Javed are once again thrown into confinement. Using the metal plate, Breslin focuses the reflection from the lights to heat the steel around the rivets, shearing the rivets when the steel expands, and pops open the floor panel to reveal a passageway below. He discovers that the prison is inside a super freighter cargo ship in the middle of the ocean, making a simple escape impossible. Breslin and Rottmayer continue to study the complex by learning the guards daily routines. However, Hobbes reveals to Breslin that he is aware of his identity, and with chief security officer Drake watching him, he wants to ensure that Breslin spends the rest of his life in prison. Breslin offers Hobbes information on Mannheim from Rottmayer in exchange for being released; Hobbes agrees.Breslin feeds Hobbes false information about Mannheim. Meanwhile, Breslins colleagues Abigail Ross and Hush grow suspicious of Clark when Breslins paycheck for the job is frozen. They discover from hacked documents that the prison, codenamed ""The Tomb,"" is owned by a for-profit organization linked to a privately owned security provider. Meanwhile, Clark is in contact with Hobbes about keeping Breslin imprisoned. Rottmayer has Javed convince Hobbes that he is double crossing them, and as payment he only wants to be allowed up on deck to do his nightly prayer. While on deck, Javed uses a makeshift sextant to determine the ships latitude. Using the latitude and weather, Breslin and Rottmayer deduce that they are in the Atlantic Ocean near Morocco. Breslin visits the infirmary of Dr. Kyrie and convinces him to help him and Rottmayer escape by sending an email to Mannheim. Breslin then transmits a false tap code message from his cell, giving Hobbes the impression that a riot will occur in cell block C. With the majority of the security stationed at cell block C, Javed instigates a riot at cell block A, giving him, Breslin, and Rottmayer time to run toward the deck while a lockdown is initiated. Breslin kills Drake, but Javed is shot dead by Hobbes and his men during their escape. Breslin goes to the engine room to shut down the electrical systems, giving Rottmayer time to open the deck hatch before the backup generators come online while a helicopter sent by Mannheim engages in a gunfight with the ships crew. Rottmayer boards the helicopter while Breslin is flushed to the bottom of the ship by the automated water system when Hobbes has the main electrical system rebooted. The helicopter picks up Breslin, but when Hobbes starts shooting at them, Breslin kills the warden by shooting and blowing up a group of oil barrels.They land on a beach in Morocco, where Rottmayer reveals that he is actually Mannheim, Mayer is his daughter, ""Portos"" was a codeword used to alert Mannheim that Breslin was an ally, and Hobbes was originally unaware that Breslins cover story was fake. Later, Ross informs Breslin that they discovered Clark was offered a $5 million annual salary to become CEO of the security company, should Breslins imprisonment prove that the ship is escape-proof.

227,228,Everest,2015,/wiki/Everest_(2015_film),"In May 1996, several commercial expeditions at base camp of Mount Everest prepare for a climb to the summit. Rob Hall, who popularized commercial Everest missions, leads Adventure Consultants; Scott Fischer is chief guide for Robs rival, Mountain Madness. Robs clients include Beck Weathers, an experienced climber; Doug Hansen, a former mailman pursuing his dream; climbing veteran Yasuko Namba, who hopes to complete her final Seven Summits ascent; and Outside magazine journalist Jon Krakauer. Helen Wilton manages Robs base camp.A month earlier in New Zealand, Rob says goodbye to his pregnant wife Jan and promises that he will be home for the birth. At the base camp Rob receives a fax from her, informing him that their baby, not yet born, is a girl. He wants to name her Sarah, but Jan disagrees.Worried about climber crowding, Rob persuades Scott to cooperate to reduce delays. On the summit attempt, Robs group departs Camp IV before dawn, planning to complete the ascent and turn around by 2:00 P.M., the latest safe time for return before nightfall. The group is delayed over an hour after discovering that guide ropes are not installed on upper reaches of the climb. Beck has eyesight problems and stops. Rob tells him to return if his condition does not improve in a half-hour. Scott hurries back down to camp to help another climber, but plans to re-ascend. Rob warns him about overexertion.Rob reaches the summit on time and is joined by other climbers including Yasuko, who jubilantly plants her Japanese flag in the snow. Descending, Rob encounters Doug struggling just above the Hillary Step and orders him to turn back. Doug insists on continuing, saying that he wont get the chance again. Rob reluctantly agrees and they reach the summit two hours later, well past safe return time. At the summit, Doug is exhausted and increasingly suffering from altitude sickness. Also at the top is Scott, exhausted and increasingly ill from high-altitude pulmonary edema.As Rob helps Doug descend, a blizzard strikes the mountain and Dougs oxygen tank is empty, causing him to suffer hypoxia. No extra bottles are stored on the route where Rob asked and he radios Helen to send someone up with oxygen. Doug, left alone briefly by Rob, semi-consciously detaches himself from the guide rope and walks unsteadily along the narrow path. He silently topples to his death a moment later.Scotts condition worsens. He tells his fellow climbers to continue descending without him. He lies down and later dies. Returning climbers reach Beck, whose vision is still impaired, but they all become lost as the blizzard obliterates the trail. Three climbers go for help, leaving Beck and Yasuko behind.Guide Andy Harold Harris reaches Rob with spare oxygen, but it is frozen shut. They huddle in place in the storm. While Rob sleeps, Andy begins to have hallucinations. He strips off his outer clothing and slides off the mountainside to his death. In the morning, Rob radios Helen that Doug and Andy are gone, and that his hands and feet are frozen. Helen calls Jan, hoping Rob will respond to her voice. Jan tells Rob that he must start moving. Rob tells her that he is cold but comfortable, and asks her to name their baby Sarah. He dies soon after.Returning climbers tell the camp that Beck and Yasuko are stranded. The weather, however, makes rescue impossible. Helen calls Becks wife, Peach, and informs her of the situation. In the morning, Beck miraculously awakens, witnesses Yasukos corpse, and stumbles back to camp alone, severely frostbitten, and in desperate need of medical help. Peach calls the American Embassy and organizes a helicopter rescue. Nepal Army pilot Lt. Col. Madan Khatri Chhetri successfully flies a harrowing high altitude mission to evacuate Beck. Meanwhile, one of Scotts guides, Anatoli, finds his body, and moves it off the trail.Returning home, Helen has an emotional reunion with Jan, who later gives birth and names her daughter Sarah.

228,229,Everything Must Go,2011,/wiki/Everything_Must_Go_(film),"Salesman Nick Halsey (Will Ferrell) is fired from his job of 16 years following an unspecified incident in Denver related to his alcoholism. He sits in the parking garage after leaving the office, drinking from a flask. He then takes the Swiss Army Knife he was given as a farewell gift and stabs it into his supervisors car tires, only to leave the knife (which has his name on it) and run away when he is unable to pull it back out from the tire. He immediately drives to a convenience store and buys a large amount of beer. When he returns home, he finds his wife is gone, the locks have been changed, and his belongings have been strewn all over his front lawn. His wife has left him a letter telling him that she is leaving him, also over the Denver incident, and to not contact her.Nick spends the night on the lawn. In the morning, he leaves to buy beer and food, returning to find his company car being taken back. In addition, his credit cards no longer work, he has been blocked from the joint checking account he has with his wife, and his phone service is terminated. When the police ask him to vacate the premises, Nick gets them to contact his AA sponsor, Detective Frank Garcia (Michael Peña), who provides him with a permit for a yard sale, allowing him three more days before he must move on. Nick gets a neighborhood boy, Kenny (Christopher Jordan Wallace), to help him sell his possessions, assuring Kenny he will pay him for the help, and also that he will teach him to play baseball. The first days sale is unsuccessful as Nick is unwilling to let items go.Nick meets his new neighbor, a pregnant young woman named Samantha (Rebecca Hall), and invites her to his backyard. There, he tells her that he had been sober for six months until attending a conference in Denver, during which he had gotten blackout drunk with a female coworker; he awoke with no memory of the night before, and soon learned that she had lodged a complaint against him, setting the stage for his firing.Nick then finds a yearbook with a friendly message from an old classmate, Delilah (Laura Dern), whom he tracks down and visits. The reunion is awkward, but Delilah nevertheless gives Nick a hug and tells him that he is a good person deep down.Now completely broke, Nick has to go without alcohol and soon experiences withdrawal. Samantha gives him a Valium and tells him that he needs help. He replies that she is no better than him because she puts up with her husbands drinking and frequent absences. Samantha storms off, angry and hurt.The next morning Nick awakes to find Kenny has arranged his belongings on the lawn and has put price tags on them. Most of the things are sold by that evening. Nick apologizes to Samantha, who admits that he was right and that she had told her husband to come home or get a divorce. She, Nick and Kenny then go out to dinner. In the restaurant restroom, Nick encounters his former supervisor, who explains that the incident in Denver probably did not happen. They fired the female employee he got drunk with because it was discovered she has a history of suing fellow employees for sexual harassment, and that Nick probably would have gotten his job back if only he hadnt slashed the supervisors tires. Nick expresses little reaction to this news, but when the supervisor leaves a glass of beer in the restroom, Nick takes it back to him without drinking a drop.After dinner, Nick meets with Frank, and answers Franks phone while he steps out of his office. The caller is Nicks wife, Catherine, telling Frank she is waiting at his house. Nick confronts Frank, who admits Catherine has been staying with him ever since she left Nick. The two men have a fight, and Frank says Catherine deserves better than Nick. It is also divulged that Nick and his wife were both recovering alcoholics. Later, while Frank drives Nick home, he observes that, because Catherine got sober and Nick didnt, their marriage had little chance of succeeding, and proceeds to list the ways Nick failed her as a husband. He then hands Nick a packet of divorce papers for him to sign, along with some spending money and keys to the house. Nick tells Frank to drop him off on the nearest curb; before he gets out of the car, he asks Frank to tell his wife hes sorry. He walks home the rest of the way, at one point stopping to look into the convenience store where he regularly bought beer, but moves on.The next day, he settles up with Kenny – including repaying him for what he skimmed from Kennys profits for beer money – and receives an appreciative hug from Samantha, whose husband has come home. She hands him the Polaroid photo she took of him a few days prior, with the message from her fortune cookie taped to the bottom, which says ""Everything is not yet lost.""",5000000,"[{""id"": 35, ""name"": ""Comedy""}, {""id"": 18, ""name"": ""Drama""}, {""id"": 10749, ""name"": ""Romance""}]",http://www.everythingmustgo-themovie.com,45658,"[{""id"": 567, ""name"": ""alcohol""}, {""id"": 1859, ""name"": ""arizona""}, {""id"": 4552, ""name"": ""beer""}, {""id"": 9639, ""name"": ""playboy""}, {""id"": 10183, ""name"": ""independent film""}, {""id"": 10332, ""name"": ""salesman""}, {""id"": 10721, ""name"": ""pregnant""}, {""id"": 11739, ""name"": ""repo man""}]",en,"When an alcoholic relapses, causing him to lose his wife and his job, he holds a yard sale on his front lawn in an attempt to start over.

229,230,Evil Dead,2013,/wiki/Evil_Dead_(2013_film),"David and his girlfriend Natalie arrive at a cabin in the woods, where the pair meet up with his younger sister Mia and his friends Eric and Olivia. The group plans to stay in the cabin while Mia overcomes her addiction to heroin. The group discover the cellar, littered with rotting animal corpses, a shotgun, and a book called the Naturom Demonto.Eric, despite written warnings, reads aloud an incantation and awakens a malevolent force. Mia begins seeing a bloody girl in the woods, and begs the group to leave because she is scared. They refuse, believing that she is simply experiencing the effects of withdrawal. Mia steals the car keys and drives away from the cabin. As Mia drives her way out, she then sees a demon girl on the road, startling her, causing her to pull over and crash into a swamp. Emerging from the mud water, the demon chases Mia through the woods. Mia stumbles into a circular opening to a thorn bush and becomes entangled by possessed vines. As Mia struggles to detangle, she then sees an Abomination version of herself. A thorny vine comes out of its mouth and rapes Mia, crawling its way up Mia’s leg into her vagina, successfully infecting her with the possession. David and Olivia find Mia and take her back to the cabin.Later, David finds his murdered dog along with a bloodied hammer, and goes to confront Mia, who is in the shower. In the bathroom, he sees her scalding herself in a heated shower. David tries to drive her to a hospital, but heavy rains flood the only road back. Meanwhile, Eric becomes more and more convinced that the book is the cause of all that.That night, the possessed Mia comes into the living room with a shotgun and shoots David in the arm as a strong wind blows through the cabin, Mia warns the others that they are all going to die tonight, after which she passes out. David instructs Olivia to get the gun away from Mia, but before she can, Mia wakes up and overpowers her, then projectile vomits blood all over her face. Olivia manages to shove Mia off, sending her tumbling down into the cellar where she is locked in by Eric. Olivia goes to the bathroom to wash the blood off her face and get a sedative for Mia, but is terrified when she sees her own disfigured reflection in the mirror. Olivia tries to rush back to the others, but becomes frozen and possessed before she could get out of the room. Hearing a door slam, Eric goes to the room and finds her cutting into her cheek with a mirror shard behind the shower curtain. Olivia attacks and stabs Eric in the chest, who grabs a broken piece of the sink and bludgeons her to death. In the shed, David nurses Erics wounds, and Eric confides that he believes that when he read the book, it released ""something evil"". Meanwhile, Mia lures Natalie into the cellar, where she bites her hand. Natalie tries to attack Mia with a box cutter, but Mia takes it from her and uses the blade to split her own tongue in half, before planting a bloodied kiss on Natalies mouth. David opens the trapdoor, interrupting the assault and allowing Natalie to escape. After the demon tells him that Mia no longer exists, he chains it up and locks the cellar door.Eric explains to David that, according to the Naturom Demonto, the Taker of Souls must claim five souls in order to unleash the Abomination. In the kitchen, while cleaning the bite wound, Natalie becomes convinced that her arm is infected and amputates it with an electric knife. David does his best to patch up her wounded arm, while Eric continues to explain that Mia must be ""purified"" either by live burial, bodily dismemberment, or burning. As they debate, the possessed Natalie attacks the pair with a nail gun, but David manages to shoot off her remaining arm with the shotgun, Natalie turns back to normal, but collapses into Davids arms and bleeds to death.Eric convinces David to kill Mia and David plans to burn down the cabin with Mia in it. However, as Mia starts singing a song from their childhood, he has a change of mind and decides to bury her instead. He digs a grave, then enters the cellar to subdue Mia, who attempts to drown him. Eric intervenes and clubs Mia with a hammer, but not before being fatally stabbed and succumbing to his wounds. David proceeds to sedate and bury Mia, unearthing and defibrillating her afterwards, which causes the demon to be exorcized and heals her. The siblings reconcile. As David enters the cabin to retrieve the car keys, a possessed Erics corpse stabs him in the neck with barb wire cutters. Mia, who escaped her buried hole but is now back to normal from being healed, comes in and sees David with the wound in his neck. Mia tries to help him. David tells Mia to go without him, which she refuses. Mia is then distracted by the possessed corpse of Eric when seeing it, allowing David to lock Mia outside himself and shoots a gasoline can inside, destroying Erics body and killing himself.Mia tearfully watches the cabin burn down and picks up an empty amulet.  A drop of blood falls on it, blood rains from the sky, and the Abomination arises, since five souls have been claimed. The Abomination attacks Mia. Mia tries to flee in a car but the Abomination bursts through the window, stopping her. Mia rushes into the cabin which stopped burning due to the rain and grabs a chainsaw to fight back, setting chainsaw oil in it to turn it on. Mia’s hand gets stuck under an open car window. Mia tears off her hand free and grabs the chainsaw. Mia then halves the Abomination with a chainsaw. Its corpse sinks into the ground and the blood-rain stops. Mia escapes into the woods and wanders off into the distance.

230,231,Exodus: Gods and Kings,2014,/wiki/Exodus:_Gods_and_Kings,"In 1300 BC, Moses, a general and accepted member of the Egyptian royal family, prepares to attack an encamped Hittite army with Prince Ramesses at Kadesh. A High Priestess divines a prophecy from animal intestines, which she relates to Ramesses father, Seti I. She tells the two men of the prophecy, in which ""a leader"" (either Moses or Ramesses) will be ""saved"" and the savior ""will someday lead."" During the battle, Moses saves Ramesses life, leaving both men troubled. Later, Moses is sent to the city of Pithom to meet with the Viceroy Hegep, who oversees the Hebrew slaves. Upon his arrival, he encounters the slave Joshua and saves him from a vicious lashing. Moses is appalled by the horrific conditions the slaves must toil in. Afterward, Moses meets Nun, who informs him of his true lineage; he is the child of Hebrew parents who was sent by his sister Miriam to be raised by Pharaohs daughter. Moses is stunned at the revelation and leaves angrily. However, two Hebrews overhear Nuns story and report their discovery to Hegep.Seti dies soon after, and Ramesses becomes the new Pharaoh (Ramesses II). Hegep reveals Moses true lineage to Ramesses, but Ramesses is unconvinced. At the urging of Queen Tuya, he interrogates the servant Miriam, who denies being Moses sister. When Ramesses threatens to cut off her arm, Moses says ""yes"", he is a Hebrew. Although Tuya wants Moses killed, Ramesses, still unwilling to believe the story, exiles him instead. Before leaving Egypt, Moses meets with his adopted mother and Miriam, who refer to him by his birth name of Moshe. Following a journey into the desert, Moses comes to Midian where he meets Zipporah and her father, Jethro. Moses becomes a shepherd, marries Zipporah and has a son, Gershom.Years later, Moses is injured in a rockslide. He encounters a burning bush and a boy, a manifestation of God of Abraham.  While recovering, Moses reveals his past to Zipporah and reveals what God has asked him to do. This drives a wedge between the couple, but Moses leaves anyway. In Egypt, Moses reunites with Nun and Joshua, as well as meeting his brother Aaron for the first time. Moses confronts Ramesses, demanding the Hebrews be released from servitude. Ramesses refuses to listen, insisting that freeing them is economically impossible. Upon Moses threatening Ramesses life, Ramesses orders Moses death, as well as killing random Hebrew families until Moses is found. Using his military skills, Moses trains the slaves and leads them in an insurgency, prompting Ramesses to retaliate harshly. Gods manifestation appears to Moses and explains that ten plagues will affect Egypt. The first nine plagues deal massive damage to Egypt and its people, but Ramesses does not back down, even oppressing his people further to maintain his position. Moses is horrified to learn from God that the tenth plague will be the death of all firstborn children but follows through with the plan. The Hebrews protect themselves by covering their doors with lambs blood as instructed by Moses, while all of Egypts firstborn children die, including Ramesses infant son. Ramesses, devastated, surrenders, allowing the Hebrews to leave.During the exodus from Egypt, the Hebrews follow Moses original path through the desert towards the Red Sea. Still grieving for his son, Ramesses assembles his army and gives chase, intending to destroy the Hebrews. After making their way through a dangerous mountain pass, Moses and the Hebrews arrive at the edge of the sea, uncertain about what to do. In despair, Moses flings his sword into the sea, which recedes, clearing a path to the opposite side. Ramesses and his army continue the pursuit, but Moses stays behind to confront them. The Red Sea reverts to its normal state, drowning the majority of the Egyptians (crossing the Red Sea). Moses survives and rejoins the Hebrews. Ramesses also survives, but is distraught and stunned over the destruction of his army and empire, and with no way to return to Egypt. Moses leads the Hebrews back to Midian, where he reunites with Zipporah and Gershom. At Mount Sinai, Moses transcribes the Ten Commandments. Years later, an elderly Moses riding with the Ark of the Covenant sees Gods manifestation walking with the Hebrews through the desert.",140000000,"[{""id"": 12, ""name"": ""Adventure""}, {""id"": 18, ""name"": ""Drama""}, {""id"": 28, ""name"": ""Action""}]",http://www.exodusgodsandkings.com/,147441,"[{""id"": 488, ""name"": ""moses""}, {""id"": 3036, ""name"": ""bible""}, {""id"": 157894, ""name"": ""ancient egypt""}, {""id"": 209714, ""name"": ""3d""}, {""id"": 211105, ""name"": ""ramses""}]",en,"The defiant leader Moses rises up against the Egyptian Pharaoh Ramses, setting 400,000 slaves on a monumental journey of escape from Egypt and its terrifying cycle of deadly plagues.",101.599427,"[{""name"": ""Scott Free Productions"", ""id"": 1645}, {""name"": ""Chernin Entertainment"", ""id"": 7076}, {""name"": ""Babieka"", ""id"": 20656}, {""name"": ""Volcano Films"", ""id"": 52184}]","[{""iso_3166_1"": ""ES"", ""name"": ""Spain""}, {""iso_3166_1"": ""GB"", ""name"": ""United Kingdom""}, {""iso_3166_1"": ""US"", ""name"": ""United States of America""}]",12/3/2014,268031828,150,"[{""iso_639_1"": ""en"", ""name"": ""English""}]",Released,"Once brothers, now enemies.",Exodus: Gods and Kings,5.6,1921,0.5,0.023265213,0.5,0.759561658,-0.259561658,-0.476734787,0.476734787,0.404343744,1.914513057

She is an intelligence officer involved in a number of sensitive and sometimes dangerous covert operations overseas.Her husband, Joseph C. Wilson, is a diplomat who most recently has served as the U.S. ambassador to Gabon. Due to his earlier diplomatic background in Niger, Wilson is approached by Plames CIA colleagues to travel there and glean information as to whether yellowcake uranium is being procured by Iraq for use in the construction of nuclear weapons. Wilson determines to his own satisfaction that it is not.After military action is taken by George W. Bush, who justifies it in a 2003 State of the Union address by alluding to the uraniums use in building weapons of mass destruction, Wilson submits an op-ed piece to The New York Times, claiming these reports to be categorically untrue.Plames status as a CIA operative is subsequently revealed in the media, the leak possibly coming from White House officials, including the Vice Presidents chief of staff and national security adviser, Scooter Libby, in part to discredit her husbands allegation that the Bush administration had manipulated intelligence to justify the invasion of Iraq.

241,242,Final Destination 5,2011,/wiki/Final_Destination_5,"In April 2000, Sam Lawton is on his way to a company retreat with his colleagues. While their bus crosses the North Bay Bridge, Sam has a premonition that the bridge will collapse, killing everyone except his ex-girlfriend Molly Harper, whom he manages to get across the bridge safely. In a panic, he persuades several people to leave the bridge before it collapses, including Molly, his friends Nathan Sears and Peter Friedkin, Peters girlfriend Candice Hooper, his boss Dennis Lapman, and his co-workers Olivia Castle and Isaac Palmer. FBI agent Jim Block doesnt believe that Sam is responsible for the bridge collapse, but promises to keep an eye on him. At the memorial service, coroner William Bludworth mysteriously tells the survivors that ""Death doesnt like to be cheated"" and warns them to be careful. However, they ignore his warning and leave, believing this to be nonsense.Later, Candice goes to the gym to practice with Peter, but a chain reaction causes her to fly off the uneven bars, and she snaps her spine, leaving Peter devastated. The next day, Isaac is killed at a Chinese spa when his head is crushed by a falling Buddha statue during an acupuncture session. Bludworth, who has been present for both deaths, tells the remaining survivors that if they wish to cheat Death, they must kill someone who was never meant to die on the bridge and thereby claim their remaining lifespan. On the same day, Olivia goes to an eye surgery clinic to treat her myopic vision. While the doctor is away looking for files, the laser malfunctions, searing her eye and hand. She manages to free herself just as Sam and Molly arrive to save her, but trips and falls out of the window onto a car below. Later, Sam learns that the survivors are dying in the order they were meant to die on the bridge, and realize that Nathan is next.Meanwhile, Nathan, who has returned to the factory, accidentally kills his co-worker, Roy Carson, during an argument by pushing him in front of a lifting hook, which impales him through the chin. As Nathan informs the remaining survivors about this, they realize he claimed Roys remaining lifespan by killing him, and therefore must be safe. When Dennis arrives to question Nathan about the incident, a wrench launched by a belt sander hits him in the face, killing him.That evening, after working at a restaurant, Sam asks his supervisor to reserve the restaurant for a date with Molly. Peter, who has become unstable after Candices death, interrupts the date and tells them that he will kill Molly to take her lifespan. After Peter draws a gun, Sam and Molly both escape to the kitchen. Agent Block overhears the gunshots from outside. When he enters the restaurant, he is shot dead by Peter. Believing that he is safe from Death, Peter decides to kill both Molly and Sam to remove any witnesses. The two men fight and Peter knocks Sam unconscious. Just as Peter is about to stab Molly with a kitchen knife, Sam awakens and stabs him in the back with a large skewer, leading Sam to believe he has claimed Blocks life.Two weeks later, Sam and Molly board a plane to Paris. As they take their seats, a fight breaks out between two passengers, Alex Browning and Carter Horton, revealing the plane he and Molly are on is Flight 180.

Florence suffers from long-term syphilis, contracted from her first husband.Florence decides to resume singing lessons. She hires pianist Cosmé McMoon, who is shocked by her singing, but Bayfield and vocal coach Carlo Edwards, the assistant conductor at the Metropolitan Opera, pretend she is wonderful. Bayfield warns McMoon of dire consequences if he criticizes her.Bayfield arranges a small recital, handpicking the attendees. Loyal Verdi Club members watch respectfully, but others barely contain their laughter. Encouraged by her good reviews, she arranges to make a recording at Melotone as a Christmas gift for members of the Verdi Club. Florence gives McMoon a copy and recalls that Bayfield was an unsuccessful actor and that she hid negative reviews from him. She also informs McMoon of her history as a piano player and teacher, having once played for the President as a child. McMoon realizes that Florence is not as musically inept as he had thought.Florence and McMoon write and perform original songs together. One song is broadcast on the radio, to the horror of Bayfield and Kathleen, though many listeners find it comedic and enjoy it. Florence informs Bayfield that she has booked Carnegie Hall for a performance and will give away a thousand tickets to soldiers. Bayfield fails to dissuade her. He gets into a fight with a group of men laughing at Florence and McMoons song at a bar. Kathleen, resenting the lack of attention, leaves him.McMoon confides to Bayfield that he fears that the recital will humiliate him and ruin his career. Bayfield replies that he gave up his acting career to support his wife and urges McMoon do the same for his friend. McMoon agrees, excited to at least play at Carnegie Hall.The concert is packed and attended by celebrities such as Cole Porter and Tallulah Bankhead. When Florence begins singing, the soldiers laugh and jeer. Her supporters and friends, however, scold them and cheer for her to keep singing. She continues her performance. However, New York Post columnist Earl Wilson tells Bayfield he will write a damning review, and refuses his bribes.Bayfield, with McMoons help, buys every copy of the New York Post in the neighborhood and throws them away. Florence hears about the review, retrieves a copy of the review from a trash can, and is so upset she collapses and becomes severely ill. As she is dying in bed, Florence imagines herself singing beautiful opera, and takes a bow with McMoon and Bayfield to a standing ovation.

When the deception fails, Nicky advises them never to lose focus when faced with unexpected situations. Jess finds him in another nightclub a few days later and convinces Nicky to become her mentor. Nicky tells her about how his father, a con man named Bucky Spurgeon, was forced to shoot his grandfather when a con went wrong, a maneuver he calls ""the Toledo Panic Button"".Jess follows Nick to New Orleans, where she is introduced to Nickys crew as well, including the obese and profane Farhad (Adrian Martinez). She picks a few pockets as a test, and soon Nicky and Jess develop a romantic relationship, upsetting Nicky, who was taught by his father to never become emotionally involved with anyone in their line of business. At the 17th Associated Football Franchise of America Championship Game at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome, Nicky gets into a round of increasingly extravagant bets with gambler Liyuan Tse (B.D. Wong), eventually losing all of the money the crew has earned.To win it back, Nicky asks Tse to pick any player on or off the field and says that Jess will guess the number picked.  A distraught Jess scans the field and notices Farhad wearing jersey number 55 and realizes it is another con. They take Tse for millions of dollars.  Nicky explains to Jess how Tse had been programmed to pick 55 since he arrived, with subtle, subconscious prompts throughout his day.  Afterwards, Nicky, wary of his growing emotional involvement, leaves Jess by the side of the road with her cut.  He instructs the driver to take her to the airport.  Jess cries as her limo drives off, leaving Nicky to climb into another waiting car.Three years later, Nicky is in Buenos Aires, working for billionaire motorsport team owner Rafael Garriga (Rodrigo Santoro). Garriga needs to beat a team headed by Australian businessman McEwen (Robert Taylor) to win the championship. Nicky will pretend to be a disgruntled technician on Garrigas team willing to sell Garrigas custom fuel use algorithm EXR. Instead he will sell McEwen a bogus version which will slow their car down during the race. At a pre-race party, Nicky runs into Jess, who is now Garrigas girlfriend. After faking heavy drinking upon seeing Jess, Nicky has a convincing fight with Garriga in public and after being thrown out, is recruited by McEwen to provide the component.Nicky begins pursuing Jess again, and they eventually rekindle their relationship. The head of Garrigas security entourage, Owens (Gerald McRaney), is suspicious and narrowly misses catching the two together. Nicky delivers the component to McEwen for three million euros but also sells it to the other teams for similar amounts.Nicky and Jess attempt to return to the United States together. However, they are caught by Garrigas men and taken to Garrigas garage. Jess is bound and gagged whilst Nicky is given a beating. Nicky has actually sold the real EXR to all of the various teams.  Garriga is convinced that Jess had something to do with Nicky gaining access to EXR and begins to suffocate Jess by holding her nose.  In order to save Jess, Nicky explains that he gained access to EXR through tricking Jess into believing he still had feelings for her.

Additionally, the characters of Alice Adrose, who represents white, and Gilda, who does not represent a color, were made specifically for the film.The film opens with the nine main characters reciting a poem of their inner thoughts (""Dark Phrases""). Kelly arrives at Tangies brownstone to see Crystal about the safety of her children. At that time, Juanita arrives to leave her lover, Frank, a potted plant and telling him that she is breaking off their affair (""No Assistance""). Kelly attempts to speak with Crystals children on how they ended up in the hospital, but is unsuccessful when Crystals alcoholic boyfriend, Beau Willie, kicks her out. Crystals nosy neighbor and apartment manager, Gilda, informs Kelly of Crystals situation (""A Night with Beau Willie Brown"") and reveals she was the one who called her. Meanwhile, Alice, Tangies mother, shows up to beseech Tangie for money, but gets rebuffed instead.Alice goes out to raise money, and encounters Yasmine, who gives her a little money. Yasmine is boasting to the girls in her dance class about Bill, a man she met on the subway, and agrees to a date, despite her initial hesitance. One of Yasmines dance students, Nyla, is talking with the girls about her graduation night and losing her virginity (""Graduation Nite""), and later begins to vomit. Juanita is waiting in Jos office at Robe Rouge, a fictional magazine company. Crystal shows up for work, having been running late and informs Jo that her 9 oclock appointment has arrived, despite it already being 10 oclock. Juanita is then allowed in to interest Jo in giving some money to a non-profit organization that specializes in womens health care, but is rudely rebuffed.Kelly is with Donald, her partner, at the gynecologist, who informs Kelly that she cannot have children due to scarring in her fallopian tubes caused by an untreated STD. So, Kelly runs off without an explanation. Juanita is at the hospital giving advice on safe sex to women when Frank comes along to ask for forgiveness, but Juanita refuses to give in to his advances. Tangie, who works as a bartender, finds a married man on business and offers to show him a ""good time.""

Nyla shows up to ask Tangie for money, explaining that she needs it for college, but Tangie is not fooled. She then deduces that Nyla is pregnant, but Nyla denies this. Tangie relishes in the fact that Nyla isnt so perfect after all and that Alice will hate her the way she hates Tangie. She then tells her about the time she got pregnant and reveals where to find a back-alley abortionist.Jo waits impatiently for Carl to return home and its then revealed that Carl was the man Donald had arrested earlier. The couple then get into an argument about Carl investing into a failed company with Jos money, which Carl did because he felt emasculated as a man, who is not providing and forfeiting his right to do anything in favor of submitting to Jos will. Donald returns to his and Kellys apartment where Kelly then reveals how she got her STD. She explains that long before she was married, she and two of her friends had been seeing the same man and all contracted a disease from him (""Pyramid""). Despite this, Donald reveals that he still loves Kelly regardless of her condition. Juanita drives home to see Frank waiting for her on the stoop. He seduces her into letting him stay at her apartment.The next day, Jo receives flowers from Carl and calls him to thank him. He reveals that he got tickets to the opera, which he hates, as an apology for last nights argument. During this conversation, he is clearly looking at other men desiringly. Yasmine also receives flowers, from Bill, and is visited by Tangie, who came by to pay the three hundred dollars for Nylas college fees. She rudely informs Yasmine that Bill only wants to ""fuck her,"" then offers to pay for Nylas fees, but Yasmine reveals that the dance class is free.Tangie realizes that Nyla went to see the abortionist, Rose (Macy Gray), who is terrifying, and probably drunk. Nylas mind completely goes blank during the abortion as Rose tells her of a story about her life in Harlem (""I Used to Live in the World""). Yasmine excitedly invites Bill into her home for dinner. After some light flirting and some drinking, Bill removes his clothing and savagely rapes her.

After she refuses, Beau Willie becomes violent and dangles the children over the fifth-story window, giving Crystal an ultimatum.

Nyla is being interrogated by Renee and Kelly, and gives them and Alice a vivid detail of her abortion (""Abortion Cycle #1"").

Jo and Carl embrace as she sobs into his shoulder. Alice and Nyla return to their apartment where Alice tells her to pray for forgiveness. As Nyla prays, Alice attempts to exorcise her with ashes and hot oil, hurting Nyla. Nyla freaks out, fights off Alice and then runs away to Yasmines apartment, hoping to find some comfort. However, Yasmine is too traumatized from her rape to answer the door, so Nyla leaves.Kelly is waiting outside the brownstone as Crystal comes out with a pail and a brush to wash away the blood of her children. Kelly walks up to her and Crystal asks if shes awake, to which Kelly, who is speechless, nods her head. Crystal comments that she does not feel awake and thinks that this is what death must feel like. Nyla passes by and Kelly takes her into Crystals apartment to wash her up. Hearing Tangie bring in yet another suitor to her apartment, Nyla confronts her. Tangie kicks her suitor out after he asks her to invite Nyla for a threesome. Tangie and Nyla hash out their problems, before Tangie reveals that her life is complicated and shes still learning from her mistakes (""No More Love Poems #4""). Afterwards, Tangie and Nyla reconcile.Yasmine is practicing an interpretive dance (""Sechita"") as Kelly discovers that Crystal has swallowed an entire bottle of pills. Crystal is taken to the hospital as Yasmine is visited by Donald, who has informed her that Bill has been murdered after attempting to rape another woman. She goes into the morgue to look at his body one last time, before slapping him and then leaving. Juanita informs Kelly, Nyla, Tangie and Gilda that the doctors pumped Crystals stomach and can see visitors as soon as she stabilizes.That night, Kelly is unable to sleep, feeling guilty for not taking Crystals children away sooner because she had to see the doctor about her infertility. Donald reassures her that one thing has nothing to do with the other. Juanita comes home with a birthday cake for Frank, only to find that he is not home and his clothes are gone. Juanita vents her frustration to her womens health class (""Somebody Almost Walked Off Wid Alla My Stuff"") as Crystal is released from the hospital and goes into therapy.

Juanita finally breaks things off with Frank for good (""No More Love Poems #1""). Gilda comes by Crystals apartment to see if shes eaten, which she hasnt. Crystal is still wondering how Beau Willie could do such a thing, but Gilda tells her that she also needs to take responsibility for not leaving Beau Willie sooner, and tells her that she needs to get out of the apartment.Jo confronts Carl on his homosexuality, which he angrily denies at first but Jo tells him that she was not oblivious to the way Carl looks at other men. After venting his frustrations over Jos controlling nature, he then admits that he has been sleeping with other men and tells her that hes sorry. Jo, however, tells him that she is not accepting his apology, having heard him apologize many times before (""Sorry""). Jo then reveals that she is HIV-positive from Carls exploits and tells Carl to leave when she gets back home.At Nylas going away party, all the women gather to celebrate. Alice arrives under Tangies invitation to give Nyla a few presents and tells Nyla shes proud of her. She then leaves to let Nyla and Tangie enjoy their night together.

256,257,Frankenweenie,2012,/wiki/Frankenweenie_(2012_film),"Young scientist Victor Frankenstein lives with his parents, Edward  and Susan Frankenstein, and his beloved Bull Terrier dog, Sparky, in the quiet town of New Holland. Victors intelligence is recognized by his classmates at school, his somber next-door neighbor, Elsa Van Helsing, mischievous Edgar ""E"" Gore, obese and gullible Bob, overconfident Toshiaki, creepy Nassor, and an eccentric girl nicknamed Weird Girl, but communicates little with them due to his relationship with his dog. Concerned with his sons isolation, Victors father encourages him to take up baseball and make achievements outside of science. Victor hits a home run at his first game, but Sparky, pursuing the ball, is struck by a car and killed.Inspired by his science teacher Mr. Rzykruskis demonstration of the effect of electricity on dead frogs, a depressed Victor hires himself as a mad scientist, digs up Sparkys corpse, brings him to his makeshift laboratory in the attic and successfully reanimates him with lightning. Seeing Weird Girls living cat, Mr. Whiskers, the undead Sparky escapes from the attic and explores the neighborhood. He is recognized by Edgar, who blackmails Victor into teaching him how to raise the dead. The two reanimate a dead goldfish, which turns invisible due to an error with the experiment. Edgar brags about the undead fish to Toshiaki and Bob, which, in panic of losing the upcoming science fair, inspires them to make a rocket out of soda bottles, which causes Bob to break his arm and Mr. Rzykruski to be blamed and fired due to his accused influencing and reviling the townsfolk for questioning his methods when he steps up for self-defense. So, the gym teacher replaces Mr. Rzykruski.Eventually, Edgars fish disappears when he tries to show it to a skeptical Nassor (who was told by Toshiaki), and when Edgar is confronted by Toshiaki, Nassor and Bob on the baseball field at school, he accidentally reveals Victors actions, inspiring them to try reanimation themselves. Victors parents discover Sparky in the attic and are frightened, causing the dog to flee. Victor and his parents search for Sparky while the classmates invade the lab, discovering Victors reanimation formula. The classmates separately perform their experiments, which go awry and turn the dead animals into monsters — Mr. Whiskers holds a dead bat while it is electrocuted, resulting in him fusing with it and becoming a monstrous bat-cat hybrid with wings and fangs. Edgar turns a dead rat he found in the garbage into a wererat, Nassor successfully revives his mummified hamster Colossus and Toshiakis turtle Shelley is covered in Miracle Gro and turns into a kaiju-like monster. Bobs Sea-Monkeys grow into amphibious humanoids. The monsters break loose into the town fair where they wreak havoc.After finding Sparky at the towns pet cemetery, Victor sees the monsters heading to the fair and goes with his classmates to help deal with them — the Sea-Monkeys explode after eating salt-covered popcorn (due to them being freshwater), and Colossus is stepped on by Shelley, while the rat and Shelley are returned to their original, deceased forms after both being electrocuted. During the chaos, Persephone, Elsas pet poodle, is grabbed by Mr. Whiskers and carried to the town windmill with Elsa and Victor chasing after. The townsfolk blame Sparky for Elsas disappearance and chase him to the windmill, which Mayor Burgermeister accidentally ignites with his torch. Victor and Sparky enter the burning windmill and rescue Elsa and Persephone, but Victor is trapped inside. Sparky rescues Victor, only to be dragged back inside by Mr. Whiskers. A final confrontation ensues, and just as Mr. Whiskers has Sparky cornered, a flaming piece of wood breaks off and impales Mr. Whiskers to death. The windmill then collapses on Sparky, presumably killing him again. To reward him for his bravery and saving Victor, the townsfolk gather to revive Sparky with their car batteries, reanimating him once more.

Reese wants to become a higher level agent with more responsibilities.  As the result of a shortage of agents in France, he is assigned as a partner to secret agent Charlie Wax (John Travolta).Reeses first test is to have Wax released from airport detention by the French Customs when Wax does not want to surrender the cans of his favorite energy drink.  Despite the apparent triviality of an energy drink that Wax could probably purchase in Paris, Wax continues to verbally abuse French Customs until Reese places a Diplomatic Mail sticker on Waxs luggage containing the energy drink, which makes them immune from customs and quarantine requirements.Once in the car, Wax apologizes for his behavior while opening the tins and revealing the concealed pieces of his personal SIG Sauer P226 X-Five Lightweight, which he refers to as ""Mrs. Jones"".  Wax explains that he has been sent to Paris to investigate a drug ring at least indirectly responsible for the death of a woman who happens to be the niece of the Secretary of Defense.During the investigation, Wax reveals that there was no overdose—their goal is to trace the money back to a circle of Pakistani terrorists.  Evidence leads them to the terrorists, resulting in an armed confrontation in which most of the terrorists are killed. Wax and Reese learn that the terrorists plan to infiltrate the U.S. embassy with explosives hidden beneath their burkas. As they collect evidence, they find photographs of Agent Reese pinned to a wall.Ultimately, Reese learns that the terrorists are targeting a summit meeting. Wax discovers that Reeses fiancée Caroline (Kasia Smutniak) is a ""sleeper"" agent who was assigned to infiltrate them. When confronted, Caroline shoots Reese in the shoulder and escapes through a window. A Volvo picks her up on the street below.Caroline attempts to detonate an explosive vest while the last remaining terrorist in the Volvo threatens a US motorcade traveling to the summit by speeding towards them, wired with explosives. Wax destroys the vehicle with an AT4 rocket launcher just in time. Reese finds Caroline at the summit and attempts to dissuade her from carrying out her mission by professing his love. She attempts to detonate her vest anyway and Reese is ultimately forced to kill her. As the U.S. official from the motorcade arrives at the summit, she berates Reese for inconveniencing her, and Wax reminds Reese of the often ungrateful and ignorant people they protect.As Wax leaves Paris, Reese escorts him to his plane.  Wax offers a full-time partnership. The two play a game of chess on the tarmac, placing their handguns on a utility cart, Reese revealing that he is now carrying a Desert Eagle pistol, and Wax welcomes him to the club as his partner.",52000000,"[{""id"": 28, ""name"": ""Action""}, {""id"": 80, ""name"": ""Crime""}, {""id"": 53, ""name"": ""Thriller""}]",http://www.frompariswithlovefilm.com/,26389,"[{""id"": 90, ""name"": ""paris""}, {""id"": 591, ""name"": ""cia""}, {""id"": 1568, ""name"": ""undercover""}, {""id"": 1653, ""name"": ""explosive""}, {""id"": 1667, ""name"": ""pimp""}, {""id"": 1704, ""name"": ""ambassador""}, {""id"": 2095, ""name"": ""anti hero""}, {""id"": 4087, ""name"": ""revelation""}, {""id"": 4653, ""name"": ""french""}, {""id"": 6083, ""name"": ""politician""}, {""id"": 6112, ""name"": ""firearm""}, {""id"": 9758, ""name"": ""deception""}, {""id"": 9844, ""name"": ""car crash""}, {""id"": 10726, ""name"": ""gang""}]",en,"James Reese has a good job as an ambassador's aid in France, but his real passion is a side gig, working in a minor role in the CIA.

They are eager to take one last run down the mountain before they go home; however, the ski resort decides to close early because a storm is moving in.The friends convince the ski lift attendant to let them on one last time. Before the group gets all the way to the top, the attendant is called into the bosss office and is replaced by a co-worker. As he leaves, he tells the co-worker that there are only three skiers left. Another set of three skiers comes down the mountain. When he sees them, he shuts down the ski lift, stranding the three friends in their ski lift chair far above the ground.They take it as a joke, but the ski resorts lights are then turned off, leaving the three friends in fear and shock. Parker knows the ski slopes have closed for the week. Dan feels he has no choice but to jump from the ski lift chair and get help, as they will not survive up there in the bitter cold until Friday.After discussing the danger, Dan decides to jump off the lift. Upon hitting the ground, he suffers a compound fracture on both of his legs. Soon, his screams and the scent of blood attracts a pack of wolves. Joe, now fearing for Dans safety, decides to try to get to the ground by traversing the suspension cable between the lifts and steel support tower. However, as wolves close in on Dan, he returns to the chair and holds Parker as Dan is brutally torn apart by the wolves.In the morning, Parker awakes with her hand frozen on the bar, which she grabbed during her sleep. She is also suffering severe frostbite. Joe discusses his previous life experiences with her, before attempting to traverse the ski lift cable, and onto a support pole on the other side. By doing this, he also causes the chair Parker is sitting in to dangerously loosen from the cable. After scaring off a pair of wolves by using a ski pole, he slides down the mountain on Parkers snowboard, planning to return with help. The wolves give chase after him. Joe never returns and Parker spends the night alone on the loose cable.The next day, Parker begins to climb out of the lift, but the screw comes loose and causes the lift to fall. Blocked by a cable, the lift is hanging a few meters above the ground. Parker jumps and then the lift lands on her ankle. Injured, she begins to slide and crawl down the mountain.

An attack by wolves leads to Kristoffs sleigh being destroyed. On foot, they meet Olaf, a cheerful snowman brought to life unknowingly by Elsa, who offers to lead them to her. When Annas horse returns to Arendelle, Hans sets out to find Anna and Elsa, accompanied by the Dukes minions, who have secret orders to kill Elsa.Reaching the ice palace, Anna meets Elsa, but when she reveals what has become of Arendelle, Elsa becomes upset, saying that she cannot undo it, and accidentally freezes Annas heart.

267,268,Frozen,2013,/wiki/Frozen_(2013_film),"Princess Elsa of Arendelle possesses magic that allows her to control and create ice and snow, often using it to play with her younger sister, Anna. After Elsa accidentally injures Anna with her magic, their parents, the King and Queen, take both siblings to a colony of trolls led by Grand Pabbie. He heals Anna, but alters her memories to remove traces of Elsas magic, warning Elsa that she must learn to control her powers. The King and Queen isolate both sisters within the castle. Elsa shuts Anna out, causing a rift between them. Unable to learn to control her power, Elsa can only suppress her power, causing her to  become more insecure. When the sisters are teenagers, their parents die at sea during a storm.When Elsa turns twenty-one, she is to be crowned queen of Arendelle. She is terrified that the kingdoms citizens might find out about her powers and fear her. The castle gates open to the public and visiting dignitaries for the first time in years. Among them is the scheming Duke of Weselton and the dashing Prince Hans of the Southern Isles, the latter of whom Anna falls in love with at first sight. Elsas coronation happens without a hitch, but she still remains distant from Anna. When Hans proposes to Anna, Elsa objects, accidentally unleashing her powers before the court; the Duke brands her a monster. Elsa flees to the North Mountain, where she builds a palace of ice in which to live a hermit life.

The movie begins with the actual footage of Oscar Grant and his friends being detained by the BART Police at the Fruitvale BART station in Oakland on January 1, 2009, at 2:15 a.m. right before the shooting.The film shows Grant and his girlfriend Sophina arguing about Grants recent infidelity. It later shows Grant unsuccessfully attempting to get his job back at the grocery store. He briefly considers selling some marijuana but in the end, decides to dump the stash. Grant later attends a birthday party for his mother, Wanda, and agrees to take the BART train to see fireworks and other New Years festivities in San Francisco since she is worried about him driving.On the return train, Katie, a customer at the grocery store where Grant used to work, recognizes Grant and calls out his name. This causes a former inmate (during Grants days in jail) to notice Grant and a fight breaks out. The BART police respond to the scene. Grant is among the passengers the BART police attempt to arrest. While being restrained by officers Caruso and Ingram, he is shot in the back by Ingram. He is rushed to the hospital, where he dies in surgery.Title cards at the end describe the aftermath: Grants killing sparked a series of protests and riots across the city and that the incident was recorded by several witnesses, either by cell phone or video camera. The BART Police officers involved were fired and ""Ingram"" (the officers names were changed) was later tried and found guilty of involuntary manslaughter, claiming he mistook his gun for his Taser, and served an 11-month sentence.

Brian begins to accustom himself to life as a father, while Dom tries to help Letty Ortiz regain her memory. Meanwhile, Owens older brother, Deckard Shaw, breaks into the secure hospital that the comatose Owen is being held in and swears vengeance against Dom and his team, before breaking into Luke Hobbs Diplomatic Security Service (DSS) office to extract profiles of Doms crew. After revealing his identity, Shaw engages Hobbs in a fight, and escapes when he detonates a bomb that severely injures Hobbs. Dom later learns from his sister Mia that she is pregnant again and convinces her to tell Brian. However, a bomb, disguised in a package sent from Tokyo, explodes and destroys the Toretto house just seconds after Han, a member of Doms team, is killed by Shaw in Tokyo. Dom later visits Hobbs in a hospital, where he learns that Shaw is a rogue special forces assassin seeking to avenge his brother. Dom then travels to Tokyo to claim Hans body, and meets and races Sean Boswell, a friend of Hans who gives him personal items found at Hans crash site.Back at Hans funeral in Los Angeles, Dom notices a car observing them, and after a chase, confronts its driver, who is revealed to be Shaw. Both prepare to fight, but Shaw flees when a covert ops team arrives and opens fire, led by Mr. Nobody. Nobody says that he will assist Dom in stopping Shaw if he helps him obtain Gods Eye, a computer program that uses digital devices to track down a person, and save its creator, a hacker named Ramsey, from a mercenary named Mose Jakande. Dom, Brian, Letty, Roman Pearce, and Tej Parker then airdrop their cars over the Caucasus Mountains in Azerbaijan, ambush Jakandes convoy, and rescue Ramsey.

272,273,Paranormal Activity,2010,/wiki/Paranormal_Activity,"Young couple Katie and Micah move to a new house in San Diego. Katie claims an evil presence has been haunting her since she was a child, so Micah sets up a camera in their bedroom to record any paranormal activity that occurs while they sleep. A famous psychic Dr. Fredrichs, who reveals that Katie is being haunted by a demon that feeds off of negative energy and is intent on tormenting Katie,  advises them not to communicate with the demon and to contact demonologist Dr. Johann Averies if needed. Katie seems interested, but Micah does not take this seriously.The camera manages to capture many strange occurrences, which are minor at first, such as noises, flickering lights, and doors moving on their own. However, Micah taunts and mocks the demon, worsening the situation. During the thirteenth night, the demon angrily screeches and there is a loud thud, causing the entire house to vibrate. Voice recorder tests are conducted by Micah the following morning, which reveal demonic grunting when Micah asks if it would like to use a Ouija board. During the fifteenth night, Katie, in an apparent trance, stands beside the bed and stares at Micah for two hours before going outside. Micah tries to convince Katie to go back inside, but she refuses and appears to remember none of it the next day.Micah brings home a Ouija board, which infuriates Katie. When they leave the house, the camera records an unseen force moving the planchette to form an unknown message on the Ouija board, which then spontaneously catches fire. Katie sees the video and pleads with Micah to contact the demonologist, but again he refuses. During the seventeenth night, Micah sprinkles baby powder in the hallway and outside the bedroom door. The couple are awakened by creaks, and find non-human footprints leading to the attic, where Micah finds a burnt photograph of a young Katie (same picture from the second film). Katie finally calls the demonologist, Dr. Averies, but he is out of the country.The events of the seventeenth night have psychologically terrified the couple, which in turn has strengthened the demon. Over the next few nights, the paranormal activity is excessive and intense. They eventually call Dr. Fredrichs back to the house, but he is overwhelmed by the demonic energy upon entering. He apologetically leaves despite their pleas, stating that his presence only makes the demon angrier. The bleak reality causes the couple to lose all hope, which makes the demon strong enough to be able to pull Katie out of the bedroom and bite her, causing her to become fully possessed. Micah discovers the bite mark and—deciding events are too out of control to remain in the house—he packs to head to a motel. Just as they are set to leave, the possessed Katie insists they will be okay now.The following night, Katie gets out of bed and stares at Micah for two hours before going downstairs. After a moment of silence, Katie screams for Micah; he abruptly rushes to help her. Afterward, Micah exclaims in pain, Katie stops screaming, and then heavy footsteps are heard coming upstairs. Suddenly, Micahs body is violently hurled at the camera, which is knocked off the tripod, revealing a demonic Katie standing in the doorway. She slowly walks into the room, stained with blood, and crawls to Micahs body, then looks up at the camera with a grin. As she lunges toward the camera, her face takes on a demonic appearance just as the scene cuts to black.

He is given the task of turning the forest of Rocky Springs into a residential development by Lyman Enterprises CEO Neal Lyman (Ken Jeong). This all transpires much to the objections of Dans son, Tyler (Matt Prokop) and wife Tammy (Brooke Shields) who are unhappy in Rocky Springs, missing their lives in Chicago. Unfortunately for Dan, the animals who are led by the raccoon refuse to sit back and watch their forest being destroyed. They manage to turn the tables on him by disturbing his progress, interrupting his meetings, and humiliating him. Upon receiving some research from his love interest Amber (Skyler Samuels), Tyler tells his father that Rocky Springs is a forest reserve where he warns his father that ""many have tried to conquer it but they all fail."" Following an attack by a bear that traps him in a tipped over portable toilet, Dan signs orders to have a drill sergeant (Billy Bush) capture and cage all the animals.Meanwhile, Tammy is forced to plan an ""eco-friendly"" fair with a senile teacher Mrs. Martin (Alice Drummond) at the high school which is sponsored by Lymans company, unaware of Lymans plans to cut down the forest to build houses and a shopping mall ""with a forest theme"". Dan, figuring this out, decides to set the animals free. Once released the raccoon and his friends immediately wreak havoc on the eco fair, causing the guests and entertainers to flee while Mrs. Martin talks to an owl. Lyman accidentally tranquilizes the sponsor for the construction, Mr. Gupta (Gerry Bednob), after he attempted to break their deal. He flees into a worm tunnel with the animals in close pursuit. The animals began attacking him, as a bear drives a golf cart, pulling the tunnel away into a bush. After some convincing from Amber and Tammy, Tyler finally tells his father that he loves him. Three months later, the forest is reclaimed as a nature preserve with Dan working as a park ranger. The poster promoting the forest preservation also states that anyone who violates the rules will be fined $1,000,000.00.During the credits, the humans and animals dance to the Transcenders version of ""Insane in the Brain.""",35000000,"[{""id"": 35, ""name"": ""Comedy""}]",http://www.furryvengeance-movie.com/,35169,"[{""id"": 10468, ""name"": ""bear""}, {""id"": 18165, ""name"": ""animal""}, {""id"": 179430, ""name"": ""aftercreditsstinger""}, {""id"": 179431, ""name"": ""duringcreditsstinger""}, {""id"": 179867, ""name"": ""real estate""}, {""id"": 184952, ""name"": ""land developer""}, {""id"": 234341, ""name"": ""real estate developer""}]",en,"When real estate developer Dan Sanders finalizes plans to level a swath of pristine Oregon forest to make way for a soulless housing subdivision, a band of woodland creatures rises up to throw a monkey wrench into the greedy scheme.

274,275,G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra,2013,/wiki/G.I._Joe:_The_Rise_of_Cobra,"In the near future, weapons master James McCullen (Christopher Eccleston) has created a nanotech-based weapon – nanomites designed to devour metal and other materials, capable of destroying anything from tanks to cities. The nanobots can only be stopped by activating the kill switch. His company M.A.R.S. sells four warheads to NATO, and NATO troops led by American soldiers Duke (Channing Tatum) and Ripcord (Marlon Wayans) are asked to deliver the warheads. Their convoy is ambushed by the Baroness (Sienna Miller), whom Duke recognizes to be his ex-fiancee Ana Lewis. Duke and Ripcord are rescued by Scarlett (Rachel Nichols), Snake Eyes (Ray Park), Breaker (Saïd Taghmaoui), and Heavy Duty (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje). They take the warheads to The Pit, G.I. Joes command center in Egypt, and upon arriving, rendezvous with the head of the G.I. Joe Team, General Hawk (Dennis Quaid). Hawk takes command of the warheads and excuses Duke and Ripcord, only to be convinced to let them join his group, after Duke reveals that he knows the Baroness.McCullen is revealed to be using the same nanotechnology to build an army of soldiers with the aid of the Doctor (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), planning on using the warheads to cause worldwide panic and bring about a new world order. Using a tracking device, McCullen locates the G.I. Joe base and sends Storm Shadow (Byung-hun Lee) and the Baroness to retrieve the warheads, with assistance from Zartan (Arnold Vosloo).After a fight, Storm Shadow and the Baroness retrieve the warheads and take them to Baron DeCobray, the Baronesss husband, for him to weaponize. Making their way to Paris, the Joes pursue the Baroness and Storm Shadow, but are unsuccessful in stopping them from launching one of the missiles. The missile hits the Eiffel Tower and releases the nanomites in it, destroying the tower and some of the surrounding area before Duke manages to hit the kill switch. However, in so doing, he is captured and taken to McCullens base under the Arctic.The Joes locate the secret base and fly there, as McCullen loads three missiles with nanowarheads, which are aimed for Beijing, Moscow, and Washington, DC, the worlds three most important cities. He intends to do this to strike fear into the hearts of every man, woman, and child on the planet, after which they will turn to the person with the most power in the world, the President of the United States. After Snake Eyes takes out one missile, Ripcord destroys the remaining two by using a stolen M.A.R.S. prototype Night Raven jet, while Scarlett, Breaker, and Snake Eyes infiltrate the base. Snake Eyes duels and prevails over Storm Shadow. Duke learns that the Doctor is Rex Lewis, Anas brother, believed to have been killed by a mistimed airstrike during a mission led by Duke (also the origin of the alienation between Duke and Ana). Rex had encountered Doctor Mindbender (Kevin J. OConnor) in the bunker and was seduced by the nanomite technology, taking too long to retrieve the data and getting caught in the bombing, which disfigured him. After freeing Duke, the Baroness is subdued, as the Doctor reveals he has implanted her with nanomites, which has put her under his control for the past four years. Attempting to kill Duke, McCullen ends up being burned, so the Doctor and he flee to an escape vessel. Duke and the Baroness pursue him while the Joes fall back; when the Doctor activates the bases self-destruct sequence, which involves blowing the ice cap to create blocks of ice which then nearly crush the Joes.The Doctor assumes the identity of the Commander, having healed McCullens burned face with nanomites, encasing it in silver and naming him ""Destro"", which places McCullen under the Commanders control. They are captured by G.I. Joe soon after. On the supercarrier USS Flagg, the Baroness is placed in protective custody until they can remove the nanomites from her body. Meanwhile, Zartan, having had his physical appearance altered by nanomites, infiltrates the White House during the missile crisis and assumes the identity of the President of the United States of America (Jonathan Pryce), thus completing a part of McCullens plan to rule the world.",175000000,"[{""id"": 12, ""name"": ""Adventure""}, {""id"": 28, ""name"": ""Action""}, {""id"": 53, ""name"": ""Thriller""}, {""id"": 878, ""name"": ""Science Fiction""}]",http://www.gijoemovie.com/,14869,"[{""id"": 949, ""name"": ""terrorist""}, {""id"": 1328, ""name"": ""secret""}, {""id"": 1562, ""name"": ""hostage""}, {""id"": 1576, ""name"": ""technology""}, {""id"": 3467, ""name"": ""warhead""}, {""id"": 6086, ""name"": ""government""}, {""id"": 8570, ""name"": ""president""}, {""id"": 9748, ""name"": ""revenge""}, {""id"": 9826, ""name"": ""murder""}, {""id"": 10563, ""name"": ""attack""}, {""id"": 14601, ""name"": ""explosion""}, {""id"": 14760, ""name"": ""scientist""}, {""id"": 155551, ""name"": ""lasers""}, {""id"": 156075, ""name"": ""evil""}, {""id"": 191574, ""name"": ""cobra""}]",en,"From the Egyptian desert to deep below the polar ice caps, the elite G.I.

The police have not been able to stop Cohens ruthless rise, as Cohen has eliminated witnesses and bribed both the court and the police, controlling both the illegal and legal sides of L.A.Determined to put a stop to Cohen, Chief Bill Parker, the head of the Los Angeles Police Department, creates a secret police unit with the sole mission of stopping Cohen and bringing him to justice. Sgt. John OMara, a respected L.A police officer and Parkers old friend, is placed in charge of recruiting additional officers. With the help of his wife, Connie, he recruits Sgt. Jerry Wooters and detectives Coleman Harris, Conway Keeler, Navidad Ramirez, and Max Kennard. Calling themselves the ""Gangster Squad"", the unit begins the task of destroying Cohens criminal operations.The units plans go well, and the unit strikes several successful blows at the heart of Cohens criminal organization and manages to shut down a very lucrative wire gambling business. Cohen believes someone has betrayed him and strikes out at those around him, including his girlfriend Grace Faraday. Wooters has also been romancing Faraday and tries to help her escape from Cohen. Cohen discovers that the police unit bugged his house, and is able to lure the police unit into a trap in Los Angeles Chinatown while Keeler is killed at the units operation. Faraday later witnesses Cohen murder Wooters friend, Jack Whalen, who had been helping her escape. With Faraday willing to testify against Cohen, OMara, along with the remaining members of his unit, blackmails a crooked judge to sign an arrest warrant for Cohen, then goes to the Park Plaza Hotel to arrest him.Cohen and his men engage in a gun battle with the police unit, with Wooters being wounded in the process. Cohen and his bodyguard Karl Lennox escape, but OMara pursues them, which results in their vehicle crashing into a fountain. Kennard gets fatally wounded from a gunshot, but he manages to kill Lennox with Navidads help before he can shoot OMara.

He then receives a phone call from a mysterious man known only as The Voice (Jon Voight), who reveals himself as the kidnapper of Magnas wife. The man tells Magna that he must follow a set of instructions precisely in order to be reunited with his wife. The Voice orders Magna to steal a specially customized Shelby Mustang from a parking garage. The Voice warns Magna that if he does not follow the instructions or is caught, Leanne will die.Magna sees two police officers chasing him and speeds off. Being a skilled driver, he is able to evade them with ease, eventually setting a trap to cause one to crash into the other. Despite more police cars joining the pursuit, Magna is able to out maneuver them. Magna is again contacted by The Voice, who directs him towards his next task. He tells Magna to speed up and take some perilous turns, eventually being forced to crash through a park, ice rink, and shopping center, nearly killing numerous civilians in the process. The Voice calls to congratulate him and tells him to keep moving. Magna is ordered to crash into a water truck and run through a red lighted intersection, causing accidents in his wake. Magna is then ordered to park in a construction zone and await further instructions. While Magna is waiting, a young woman, who is armed with a gun, known only as The Kid (Selena Gomez) attempts to steal Magnas car, but Magna overpowers her and takes her gun, and then takes her with him on The Voices orders. The Voice then orders Magna to kill The Kid. Magna refuses, and The Voice says that keeping her alive was the right choice, as he will need her help. As Magna and The Kid drive off, with more police in pursuit, she reveals that the Mustang is, in fact, her car, and that she was told, by a police officer, it was stolen. Magna realizes that their meeting was orchestrated by The Voice.After the Voice assigns Magna another destructive task, The Kid reveals herself as a skilled computer hacker and the daughter of the C.E.O of a large bank.

The Kid points out that there is no actual money at her fathers bank; it is an investment firm which holds all of its assets on computers.

Now fleeing from the police and The Voices men, Magna calls The Voice and offers to release the hard drives in exchange for his wife. The Voice accepts and directs him to an airplane hangar.

278,279,Ghost Rider,2012,/wiki/Ghost_Rider_(2007_film),"Over one hundred years ago, the devil  Mephistopheles sent his bounty hunter of the damned, the Ghost Rider, to retrieve a document known as the Contract of San Venganza, a list of a thousand corrupt souls. Seeing that the contract would give Mephistopheles the power to unleash hell on Earth, the rider refuses to give him the contract.In 1986, Mephistopheles reaches out to 17-year-old stunt motorcycle rider Johnny Blaze, offering to cure his fathers cancer in exchange for Blazes soul, an offer he was examining when the paper cuts his finger, a drop of his blood landing on the dotted line. Unwittingly, the deal is sealed. The next morning, Blaze awakes to discover that his fathers cancer is cured, but he is killed that same day in a motorcycle stunt in which he falls into the ring of fire through which he jumps. Blaze accuses Mephistopheles of causing his fathers death, but Mephistopheles considers their contract to be fulfilled and promises to one day see him again.21 years later, Blaze has become a famous stunt motorcycle rider known for surviving numerous deadly crashes. Blaze meets his lifelong sweetheart Roxanne Simpson, now a news reporter, whom he abandoned after his fathers death. He convinces her to attend a dinner date. Meanwhile, Blackheart, the demonic son of Mephistopheles, comes to Earth, along with three fallen angels who bonded with the elements air, earth, and water. They seek to find the Contract of San Venganza. In response, Mephistopheles makes Blaze the new Ghost Rider and offers to return his soul if he defeats Blackheart, though he is also told he has no choice since he signed a contract with him. Blaze is driven straight to the station on his first ride, where he transforms into the Ghost Rider and kills the earth demon, Gressil. He also saves a young girl from a mugger and incinerates him with the Penance Stare (a power which allows the Ghost Riders to make any evil mortal experience all the pain they caused on their victims, burning away their very soul). The next day, he meets a man called the Caretaker, who seems to know all about the history of the Ghost Rider. He tells him everything which happened was not a dream and that it will happen again, especially at night when he is near an evil soul.When he arrives home, Blaze finds Simpson and reveals himself as the devils bounty hunter. Unconvinced, she walks away in disbelief. After a brief imprisonment for the murders which Blackheart committed, where when the inmates try to beat him up, Blaze transforms into the Ghost Rider and knocks them all out when he does, escapes the jail. The air demon, Abigor, attacks Blaze while Simpson and police watch, and is killed when Blaze traps him in a fiery tornado. The cops open fire on Blaze, but he forces them back with a wall of fire to warn them to stay out of his way, before returning to the Caretaker, who tells him of his predecessor, Carter Slade, a Texas Ranger who hid the Contract of San Venganza. Blaze returns home to find that Blackheart has killed his friend Mack and has taken Roxanne captive, threatening to kill her if Blaze does not deliver the contract. Blaze tries to use the Penance Stare on Blackheart, but it does not work as Blackheart has no soul to burn.Blaze returns to the caretaker, who reveals himself as Carter Slade, and obtains the contract. Slade tells Blaze that he is more powerful and unpredictable than his predecessors since he sold his soul for love as opposed to other Riders who sold their own for greed. Slade leads Blaze to San Venganza, then gives Blaze a lever-action shotgun and the advice Stick to the shadows before riding away.Crossing the river into San Venganza Blaze is ambushed by the water demon Wallow, whom he quickly boils to death. Blaze trades the contract to Blackheart for Simpson. He quickly transforms into Ghost Rider in an effort to subdue Blackheart, but dawn arrives and he is rendered powerless. Blackheart uses the contract to absorb the thousand souls into his body, renaming himself ""Legion"". He attempts to kill Blaze, taunting that the Earth would be his to rule, but is distracted when Simpson uses Blazes discarded shotgun to separate them. Staying in shadow, Blaze finds he can still become the Ghost Rider, and after trying to kill Blackheart with the shotgun infused with his power, he seizes him and uses the Penance Stare on him, burning all the corrupt souls within Blackheart, just as he had hoped for, and is left with his eyes reduced to glowing cinders.Mephistopheles appears and offers to return Blaze his soul, offering to take back the curse of the Ghost Rider. Determined not to make another deal, Blaze declines, saying that he will use his power against him, and against all harm that comes to the innocent.

279,280,Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance,2012,/wiki/Ghost_Rider:_Spirit_of_Vengeance,"In Romania, a French priest named Moreau warns the monks of a monastery about an impending attack by the devils forces to obtain a boy named Danny. The monastery falls under attack; Moreau tries to help the boy and his mother Nadya escape, but the distrusting mother shoots at Moreau and flees with her son. Moreau manages to distract the men chasing Danny and Nadya, but nearly dies in the process and loses them. He believes that only the Ghost Rider is capable of protecting the boy. He finds the Rider and seeks his help.Eight years have passed since Johnny Blaze became the Ghost Rider – a vengeful, fiery spirit who feeds on the evil of his victims and consumes the souls of sinners. No matter how big or small the infraction — anything from genocide to a white lie — the Rider does not differentiate. This drives Blaze into hiding, fighting the evil spirit within him. Moreau finds him and convinces him to save the boy in exchange for his priesthoods ability to restore Johnnys soul and remove the Ghost Riders curse. Meanwhile, pursuers force Nadya and Danny from the road and bring them to their leader: her former boyfriend Ray Carrigan. Carrigan has Danny tied up and is about to execute Nadya when the Ghost Rider appears; the Ghost Rider kills several of Carrigans men and then moves in on Danny. Nadya distracts the Ghost Rider, who then is shot with grenades into submission.Johnny awakens in a hospital. On the way out, he convinces Nadya not to trust him, but to accept his help to find Danny. Carrigan tells Roarke about the Rider, and Roarke speaks an incantation to Danny via phone, which effectively puts up a ""firewall"" preventing the Rider from sensing Dannys whereabouts. He warns Carrigan it will not shield him from being sensed and gives him instructions to deliver Danny. Nadya later tells Blaze that as she lay dying, she made a deal with Roarke: her life in return for him impregnating her with Danny, making Danny a direct vessel for Roarke and the potential for him to have unlimited power on the surface world. Roarke lacks this power so far from Hell. Danny nearly escapes, but breaks his ankle and is recaptured. That night, Nadya and Johnny interrogate a known contact of Carrigans. Johnny takes off ahead of Nadya to deal with Carrigan. Nadya saves Danny as the Rider converts a mining machine (a Bagger 288) into a massive fiery machine, destroying their hideout complex and mortally wounding Carrigan. When Ghost Rider catches up to Nadya and starts to use his Penance Stare on her, Danny is able to stop the Rider with a word, exercising his hidden power.Moreau catches up with the group as they ride off. Roarke is not done with Carrigan; using his power, he turns Carrigan into a demon called Blackout capable of instantly decaying anything he touches while shrouded in darkness. Johnny and Nadya bring Danny to Moreaus monastery with warm reception. Moreau explains that the Ghost Rider is the twisted incarnation of the Spirit of Justice, Zarathos, after being captured and tortured to madness while in Hell. Moreau tells Johnny that he can exorcise the spirit from him if Johnny tells a secret that only he knows of. Johnny confesses that his deal with Roarke was really a selfish one: his stepfather had accepted his cancer and was ready to die; Johnny was the one who did not want him to go. With this confession, Moreau exorcises Johnny of the spirit and Johnny becomes human again. The head monk Methodius proclaims that Danny will never be safe from the influence of evil and says he must die, taking Johnny, Moreau, and Nadya captive in order to execute the boy. Carrigan intervenes, killing the monks and taking Danny captive again to deliver to Roarke. The others follow, with Johnny not wanting to desert Danny after having promised to protect him. With the ritual to transfer Roarkes spirit and power into Danny underway, the three infiltrate the compound to save him. Carrigan kills Moreau, but Danny (who Roarke states has the same powers as he does) gives Johnny back the power of the Ghost Rider. Roarke manages to escape with Danny and the Ghost Rider and Nadya give pursuit. After a vehicular struggle, Ghost Rider manages to defeat Carrigan and causes the SUV carrying Roarke and Danny to crash. The Ghost Rider sends Roarke back into Hell while Danny, who had died in the accident, is returned to his mother. Channeling the blue flame of Zarathos, Johnny manages to revive Danny and assures him of his safety.As the film closes, the angelic blue flaming Ghost Rider rides off on his motorcycle, saying: ""My name is Johnny Blaze.

280,281,Ghostbusters,2016,/wiki/Ghostbusters_(2016_film),"Physicists Abby Yates and Erin Gilbert are authors of a research book which posits the existence of paranormal phenomena, such as ghosts. While Abby continued to study the paranormal at a technical college with eccentric engineer Jillian Holtzmann, Erin, now a professor at Columbia University, disowned the work, fearing it will impact her tenure. When Abby republishes the book, Erin convinces her to agree to remove the book from publication in exchange by helping Abby and Jillian in a paranormal investigation. They witness a malevolent ghost, restoring Erins belief in the paranormal, but video footage of the investigation is posted online, and Erin is fired by the university. She joins Abby and Jillian to set up new offices above a Chinese restaurant, calling themselves ""Conductors of the Metaphysical Examination"". They build equipment to study and capture ghosts, and hire the dimwitted but handsome Kevin Beckman as a receptionist.MTA staffer Patty Tolan witnesses a ghost in a subway line and contacts the group. They document the ghost and successfully test Jillians proton containment laser, but their findings are again dismissed. They continue to develop their technology and advertise their services with the name pundits have labeled them, ""Ghostbusters"". Patty joins the team, providing historical knowledge of New York City and a repurposed hearse, ""Ecto-1"".Unbeknownst to the Ghostbusters, the ghosts are being summoned by devices built by Rowan North, an occultist attempting to bring about the apocalypse. When Rowan plants another device at a live music venue, the Ghostbusters are called in and capture the ghost in front of the audience. When supernatural debunker Dr. Martin Heiss challenges the Ghostbusters, the incensed Erin releases the ghost as proof; it throws Heiss out a window and escapes. The Ghostbusters are brought to Mayor Bradley and his secretary Jennifer Lynch, who reveal that the city and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) are aware of New Yorks ghost problem. While privately supporting the teams work, the mayors office and the DHS publicly denounce them as fraudsters.The Ghostbusters realize that Rowan is planting his devices along ley lines, which intersect at the Mercado Hotel in Times Square, a site with a history of paranormal activity, and discover Rowan building a portal to the ghost dimension in the hotel basement. To avoid capture, Rowan commits suicide by electrocuting himself, after which Jillian deactivates the portal.  Erin discovers a copy of her and Abbys book among Rowans possessions and realizes that he killed himself so he could become a ghost and command a spirit army.  Rowan returns as a powerful ghost, possessing Abby and then Kevin. As Kevin, he opens the portal and releases hundreds of ghosts. The police and DHS are subdued, but the Ghostbusters fight through the army of ghosts to reach the portal.Rowan takes the form of the ghost in the Ghostbusters logo, grows to enormous height, and attacks the city. The team devises a plan to use Ecto-1s nuclear reactor to close the portal and return the ghosts to their own dimension. The plan succeeds, but Rowan drags Abby into the portal with him; Erin leaps into the portal and rescues her as Rowan is obliterated. The mayors office agrees to secretly fund the Ghostbusters research while continuing to publicly denounce them as frauds. With new funding, the Ghostbusters move to a better facility, a disused fire house. New York lights up with thanks and tributes to the Ghostbusters.

281,282,Going the Distance,2010,/wiki/Going_the_Distance_(2010_film),"Erin Langford (Drew Barrymore) is a 31-year-old woman who is having trouble pacing her life. She is still in grad school and she recently got a job as a summer intern at a newspaper in New York. While out with a friend at a bar, she meets Garrett (Justin Long), who interrupts her game of Centipede. The two then drink together and end up at his place, where they smoke from a bong and have sex while Garretts roommate Dan (Charlie Day) ""DJs their hook up"". The next morning, Erin is anxious to leave but Garrett asks her to have breakfast with him and she agrees. She then tells him that she is only in New York for six weeks and is not looking for a relationship. He agrees to keep things casual.Erin and Garrett start having a fling, but they soon develop feelings for each other, and Erin tries to convince her boss to find her a permanent position. Before the end of her internship, she writes a well-received article, and her boss asks her to contact him in January regarding possible job openings. Meanwhile, Garrett, who works at a record label, is given an assignment to manage a band he does not like, and is starting to dislike his job.They both continue with their fling, but when the six weeks are up they find it difficult to let go. After Garrett drives Erin to the airport they say goodbye, but just as Erin is about to leave Garrett runs after her and tells her that he is crazy about her and wants to have a long-distance relationship with her. She agrees.Over the next couple of months Erin and Garrett spend all their free time texting and calling one another trying to work out times when one of them can fly in. Garrett surprises Erin by showing up on Thanksgiving and they have a very emotional reunion. When they go to Erins sister Corrines house (where Erin is currently staying), they start to have passionate sex on the dining table while, unbeknownst to them, Erins brother-in-law, Phil, is having dinner. Corrine eventually walks in and there is an awkward moment. The next day, Erin and Garrett are out to see The Boxer Rebellion, and they agree that the band is good. Garrett gets jealous when he sees that Erin is friends with Damon, a handsome bartender who works with her. Garrett eventually has to leave and goes back to New York.In January, Erin calls her summer internship boss and asks him about the possibility of a job. Her boss tells her they are not hiring—that in fact they have just laid off 100 employees. Not finding comfort in a phone conversation with Garrett, she goes and gets drunk with Damon and almost kisses him, but ends up going home. Later, her professor mentions that he recommended her for a position at the San Francisco Chronicle and she goes for an interview. Meanwhile, Garrett tries to have phone sex with Erin, but it does not go well.A month later as Erin is packing to go to New York she gets a call from the Chronicle letting her know that she is hired. She goes to New York and tells Garrett, and the two have a fight. The next day they make up and he asks her to make the decision whether or not to accept the job. A week later he calls her and tells her he wants her to move to New York so that they can live together and start fresh. She agrees and he goes to San Francisco to sort things out. However, after a conversation with Corrine, Garrett realizes that he cannot be the reason that Erin turns down the job and the two part ways after an emotional conversation and a long hug in the airport.Six months later Erin is doing well with her career, having written her first front page story, and Garrett has not been with any woman since Erin. He quits his job and starts managing The Boxer Rebellion, the first band he and Erin saw together. He sends Erin tickets to their show and she goes, not knowing that he is the manager. She runs into him there and he tells her he has moved to Los Angeles. Since that is only a few hours away from San Francisco, they have another chance at a relationship. Late that night they go back to Corrines house, and interrupt Corrine and Phil dry humping on the dining-room table (like Garrett and Erin earlier in the film). The film ends with Erins niece, Maya, descending from upstairs during the awkward moment, and they all scream ""Maya! Statue!"" (a running joke where Corrine always yells ""Maya!

282,283,Gone Girl,2014,/wiki/Gone_Girl_(film),"The day of their fifth wedding anniversary, writing teacher Nick Dunne returns home to find his wife Amy is missing. Her disappearance receives heavy press coverage because Amy was the inspiration for her parents popular Amazing Amy childrens books. Detective Rhonda Boney does a walkthrough of their house and finds poorly concealed evidence of a struggle. The police conduct a forensic analysis and uncover the remnants of cleaned blood stains, leading to the conclusion that Amy was murdered. Suspicions arise that Nick is responsible, and his apathetic behavior is interpreted by the media as characteristic of a sociopath.Flashbacks reveal that Nick and Amys marriage had disintegrated; both lost their jobs in the recession and moved from New York City to Nicks hometown of North Carthage, Missouri. Nick became lazy and distant, and began cheating on Amy with one of his students.  Boney unearths evidence of financial troubles and domestic disputes, and a witness states that Amy wanted to purchase a gun. She also finds a medical report indicating that Amy is pregnant, of which Nick denies knowledge, and a diary supposedly written by Amy highlighting her growing isolation, ominously ending with the fear that Nick will kill her.Amy is revealed to be alive and well, having changed her appearance and gone into hiding in a distant campground in the Ozarks. Upon learning that Nick was cheating on her, she resolved to punish him by framing him for her murder. Amy plans the framing in great detail: she befriends a pregnant neighbor to steal her urine for the pregnancy test, drains her own blood to leave traces of evidence of murder and fabricates a diary describing her fear of Nick. She also has Nick increase her life insurance so it looks like he murdered her for the money. By using the clues in a ""treasure hunt"" game she and Nick play on their anniversary, she ensures he visits places where she has planted the corroborating evidence of Nicks guilt for the police to discover. She anticipates Nick will be convicted and executed for her murder, and contemplates committing suicide after his conviction.Nick hires Tanner Bolt, a lawyer who specializes in defending men accused of killing or raping their wives. Nick meets Amys ex-boyfriend Tommy OHara, who says Amy falsely accused him of rape, and gradually deduces Amys plan. He also approaches another ex-boyfriend, the wealthy Desi Collings, against whom Amy previously filed a restraining order, but Desi refuses to share any details. When Amys neighbors at the campground rob her of her remaining money, she calls Desi and convinces him that she ran away from Nick because he was abusing her. He agrees to hide her in his lake house, which is equipped with surveillance cameras.Nick convinces his twin sister, Margo, of his innocence. After Nicks mistress reveals their affair at a press conference, Nick appears on a talk show to profess his innocence and apologize for his failures as a husband in the hope of luring Amy. His performance rekindles Amys feelings for him, even as Boney arrests him for Amys murder. Amy inflicts injuries on herself and uses Desis surveillance cameras to her advantage, making it appear that Desi kidnapped and raped her. She seduces Desi and kills him during sex by slitting his throat. Covered in Desis blood, she returns home and names him as her captor and rapist, clearing Nick of suspicion.When Boney questions Amy about the holes in her story, Amy accuses her of incompetence. The FBI sides with Amy, forcing Boney to back down. Amy tells Nick the truth, saying that the man she watched pleading for her return on TV is the man she wants him to become again. Nick shares this with Boney, Bolt, and Margo, but they have no way to prove Amys guilt.Nick intends to leave Amy and expose her lies, but Amy reveals she is pregnant, having artificially inseminated herself with Nicks sperm stored at a fertility clinic. Nick doubts the child is his and says he will take a paternity test. He then reacts violently to Amys insistence that they remain married, but feels responsible for the child.

Dr. Ryan Stone is aboard on her first space mission as a mission specialist, her job being to perform a set of hardware upgrades on the Hubble. During a spacewalk, Mission Control in Houston warns Explorers crew about a Russian missile strike on a defunct satellite, which has inadvertently caused a chain reaction forming a rapidly-expanding cloud of space debris, ordering the crew to return to Earth immediately.

286,287,Green Lantern,2011,/wiki/Green_Lantern_(film),"Billions of years ago, beings called the Guardians of the Universe used the green essence of willpower to create an intergalactic police force called the Green Lantern Corps. They divided the universe into 3600 sectors, with one Green Lantern per sector. One such Green Lantern, Abin Sur of Sector 2814, defeated the malevolent being Parallax and imprisoned him in the Lost Sector on the desolate planet Ryut. In the present day, Parallax escapes from his prison after becoming strengthened by an encounter with crash survivors who had accidentally fallen into the dugout where Parallax was imprisoned on the  abandoned planet. Parallax feeds on their fear to gain strength before pursuing and nearly killing Abin Sur, who escapes and crash-lands on Earth where he commands his power ring to find a worthy successor.Hal Jordan, a cocky test pilot working at Ferris Aircraft, is chosen by the ring and transported to the crash site, where the dying Abin Sur appoints him a Green Lantern, telling him to take the lantern and speak the oath. Jordan says the oath and is whisked away to the Green Lantern Corps home planet of Oa, where he meets and trains with veteran Corps members Tomar-Re, Kilowog, and Corps leader Sinestro, who believes he is unfit and fearful. Jordan, disheartened by his extreme training sessions and Sinestros doubts, quits and returns to Earth, keeping the power ring and lantern.Scientist Hector Hammond is summoned by his father, Senator Robert Hammond, to a secret government facility to perform an autopsy on Abin Surs body under the watchful eye of Amanda Waller. A piece of Parallax inside the corpse enters Hammond, giving him telepathic and telekinetic powers at the cost of his sanity. After discovering that he was chosen for the secret work only due to his fathers influence and not for his own abilities, Hammond attempts to kill his father by telekinetically sabotaging his helicopter at a massive party. Jordan saves the senator and the party guests, including his childhood sweetheart Carol Ferris. Later, at the government facility, Hammond uses telekenisis to successfully kill his father by burning him alive. Hammond also elevates Waller high above the floor. As shes falling, Jordan arrives and saves the injured Waller by creating a pool of water which whisks her away out of further danger. During the encounter Jordan learns of Parallax coming to Earth.On Oa, the Guardians tell Sinestro that Parallax was one of their own until he desired to control the yellow essence of fear, only to become corrupted. Arguing that the way to fight fear is with fear itself, Sinestro requests that the Guardians forge a ring of the same yellow power, preparing to concede Earths destruction to Parallax in order to protect Oa. Jordan appears and tries to convince the Guardians that fear will turn the users evil if its power is used, but they reject his pleas, and he returns to Earth to try to defeat Parallax on his own.Jordan saves Ferris from Hammond after a brief showdown. Parallax arrives, consumes Hammonds entire life force, and then wreaks havoc on Coast City. After a fierce battle, Jordan lures Parallax away from Earth and toward the sun. Parallax is inadvertently caught in the suns gravitational pull and is destroyed, while Jordan escapes. Jordan loses consciousness after the battle and falls toward the sun, but is saved by Sinestro, Kilowog, and Tomar-Re.The entire Green Lantern Corps congratulates Jordan for his bravery. Sinestro tells Jordan he now bears the responsibility of protecting his sector as a Green Lantern.In a mid-credits scene, Sinestro takes the yellow ring and places it on his finger, causing his green suit and eyes to turn yellow.",200000000,"[{""id"": 12, ""name"": ""Adventure""}, {""id"": 28, ""name"": ""Action""}, {""id"": 53, ""name"": ""Thriller""}, {""id"": 878, ""name"": ""Science Fiction""}]",http://greenlanternmovie.warnerbros.com/,44912,"[{""id"": 849, ""name"": ""dc comics""}, {""id"": 4375, ""name"": ""transformation""}, {""id"": 9715, ""name"": ""superhero""}, {""id"": 9951, ""name"": ""alien""}, {""id"": 15250, ""name"": ""alien infection""}, {""id"": 15252, ""name"": ""magical object""}, {""id"": 15254, ""name"": ""protector""}, {""id"": 163455, ""name"": ""super powers""}, {""id"": 202540, ""name"": ""origin""}, {""id"": 209714, ""name"": ""3d""}]",en,"For centuries, a small but powerful force of warriors called the Green Lantern Corps has sworn to keep intergalactic order.

Pat calls the police, but bar employees Gabe (Macon Blair) and Big Justin (Eric Edelstein) confiscate the bands phones and hold them hostage in the green room. Gabe pays a skinhead to stab another to create a cover story for the police who respond to the call. He consults with bar owner and skinhead leader Darcy (Patrick Stewart), who decides to kill the band to eliminate witnesses.The band overpowers Big Justin and holds him hostage, taking a boxcutter from his pocket and his pistol. They negotiate through the door with Darcy, who asks them to surrender the pistol. Pat agrees, but as he opens the door, Emilys friend Amber (Imogen Poots) realizes it is a trap and shouts. Darcy and his men slash at Pats arm with machetes until he drops the gun, but he closes the door. Big Justin attacks the band, but Reece chokes him into unconsciousness. When Big Justin surprises Reece by awaking again, Reece chokes Big Justin again and Amber kills him with the boxcutter.Searching for a way out, the band discovers an underground drug lab, but the only exit is locked from the outside.

288,289,Green Zone,2010,/wiki/Green_Zone_(film),"On March 19, 2003, Iraqi General Mohammed Al-Rawi (Yigal Naor) flees his residence amid the bombardment of Baghdad. Before leaving the compound, he passes a notebook to his aide Seyyed, instructing him to warn his officers to get to their safehouses and wait for his signal.Four weeks later, U.S. Army Chief Warrant Officer Roy Miller (Matt Damon) and his platoon check a warehouse for Iraqi weapons of mass destruction. To Millers surprise, the warehouse has not been secured, with looters making their way in and out, as soldiers from the 101st Airborne Division are too few to do much. After a firefight with a sniper, Miller finds that the warehouse is empty, the third consecutive time he has found nothing. Later, at a debriefing, Miller brings up the point that the majority of the intel given to him is inaccurate and anonymous. High-ranking officials quickly dismiss his concerns. Afterward, CIA agent Martin Brown (Brendan Gleeson) tells him that the next place he is to search was inspected by a UN team two months before and that it too has been confirmed empty.Meanwhile, U.S. Department of Defense official Clark Poundstone (Greg Kinnear) welcomes returning Iraqi exile politician Ahmed Zubaidi (Raad Rawi) at the airport. There Poundstone is questioned by Wall Street Journal reporter Lawrie Dayne (Amy Ryan). She says she needs to speak directly to ""Magellan"", but Poundstone brushes her off.Meanwhile, while checking another unpromising site, Miller is approached by an Iraqi who calls himself ""Freddy"" (Khalid Abdalla). Freddy tells him that he saw some Baath Party VIPs meeting in a nearby home. They include Al-Rawi and his officers and aides in Baghdad, who are discussing the current situation. Al-Rawi decides to wait for the Americans to offer him a deal, and attack if they dont. As the meeting ends, Miller and his men burst into the house. Al-Rawi narrowly escapes, but Seyyed is captured. Before Miller can extract much information, Seyyed is taken away by Special Operations personnel - however, Miller keeps Al-Rawis notebook. Dayne complains to Poundstone again, but he states that the stakes are much larger than her role in selling newspapers.Miller goes to Browns hotel in the Green Zone, where he tells him what happened and gives him the notebook. Brown arranges for Miller to get into the prison where Seyyed is being interrogated. Miller is then approached by Dayne, who questions him about the false reports of WMDs. Miller bluffs his way in to see Seyyed. Near death after being tortured, he tells Miller that they ""did everything you asked us to in the meeting."" When Miller asks what meeting he is talking about, he says one word: ""Jordan."" Miller then confronts Dayne about the bogus intel she published, but she refuses to identify Magellan, her source. After Miller tells her he suspects that Al-Rawi is Magellan, Dayne reluctantly confirms that Magellan met with a high-ranking official in February in Jordan.Miller realizes that Poundstones men are hunting Al-Rawi, and can think of only one reason: Al-Rawi confirmed there was no Iraqi WMD program and is now a major liability. Poundstone confiscates the notebook from Martin; it contains the locations of Al-Rawis safe houses. When Miller tries to arrange a meeting with Al-Rawi, he is abducted by Al-Rawis men following Poundstones announcement of the decision to disband the entire Iraqi army. Al-Rawi tells Miller that he informed Poundstone that the WMD program had been dismantled after the First Persian Gulf War; Poundstone, however, reported that Al-Rawi had confirmed there were WMDs so the US government would have an excuse to invade. Poundstones men attack the locations listed in the notebook. When they get to the generals hiding place, he flees, ordering one man to kill Miller. Miller manages to kill his captor and races after Al-Rawi. Miller finally captures Al-Rawi, but Freddy suddenly appears and shoots the general, telling Miller that ""the fate of Iraq is not yours to decide"". With his only witness against Poundstone now dead, Miller tells Freddy to flee.Later, Miller writes a scathing report. He confronts Poundstone in a meeting and gives him the report, but Poundstone dismisses it, telling Miller that WMDs do not matter. Poundstone then rejoins the meeting, only to see Iraqi factional leaders reject Zubaidi, the USs choice as leader of Iraq, as an American puppet and storm out. Afterwards, Dayne receives Millers report by email.

But alas, when Smith goes on a hunting adventure with Butch, Butch injures himself while chasing a doe.  Smiths rescuing Butch makes him a local hero, but also strains his relationship with his father.  With Butch unable to work, his wife decides to move away from the house and takes Amy with her.  Amy, unable to deal with the turmoil in her own family, threatens to run away.  Smith leaves the house on his bike to meet up with her, though Butch arrives soon after and prevents her from doing so.  Smiths parents, in the meantime, search for him and find his sister making out with a boy.  Furious, they condemn his sister to studying, and upon Smiths return banish him back to India after he declares his love for Amy.  Nineteen years pass in India, with Smith becoming a neurosurgeon and finding a woman to marry.  Smiths wife dies of a complication - though unknown - that Smith himself tries to cure.Smith returns to his hometown in America, where his sister has a family with Patrick (the same boy she was found making out with nineteen years earlier) and lives in the same house as before.

The friends coach, Robert Ferdinando, whom they nickname ""Buzzer"", encourages them to live their lives in a similar way to how they played the game. Thirty years later, Lenny has become an ambitious Hollywood talent agent with his wife, fashion designer Roxanne, and his three children—daughter Becky and two sons Greg and Keith. The boys act like divas in his mansion, much to his chagrin. Eric claims that he is now a co-owner of a lawn furniture company, and is also disappointed in his wife Sally for continuing to breastfeed Bean, one of his two children, the other being Donna. Kurt is a stay-at-home father with two children, Andre and Charlotte. His wife Deanne, the primary breadwinner of the family, is pregnant with another child and shares the house with her mother Ronzoni. Rob, nicknamed Carrot, has been divorced three times, and holds custody of his daughters Jasmine, Amber, and Bridget. His current wife, Gloria, is thirty years his senior. Marcus is a slacker and lothario. All five friends regularly harass each other in comedic fashion: Lenny for being wealthy, Eric for being overweight, Kurt for being henpecked, Rob for his continuous use of the joke ""Maize!"" and for having a much older wife, and Marcus for being sexually juvenile.The friends each find out that Buzzer has died, and reunite at their hometown with their families, a first in the three decades. Intending to pay tribute to Buzzer at a private funeral, Lenny rents the lake house for the fourth of July weekend for his friends to stay at. However, Roxanne has planned a fashion show in Milan, forcing Lenny to leave early. While at the lake house, he becomes disheartened at how his sons are playing video games instead of being outdoors, and pushes them to play outside along with his friends children, even being forced to have Eric demonstrate a rope swing next to the lake, only for Eric to chicken out due to the swing being too high above the water and accidentally hit a nearby tree in the process. At a local restaurant that night, Lenny talks to his old nemesis, Dickie, who is still angry towards Lenny for an error in the match, where his shot shouldnt have counted since he allegedly had his foot on the outside line. With this, Dickie challenges Lenny and his friends to a rematch, but he declines when commenting on Dickies health. The next day, Buzzers ashes are spread in the woods while Rob has a confidence crisis, regretting his failed marriages, and later warns the arrival of his three daughters from the previous marriages. After having to deal with Jasmine, he then relaxes with his friends partaking in fishing. After roasting Rob, the others elect to cheer him up with a game of arrow roulette. Rob wins by staying in the circle for the longest time, but the arrow impales his foot when it flies back down. Rob then snaps at Gloria for using a maize-covered poultice. That night, Lenny manages to get the kids interested in talking on cup-phones and Roxanne accidentally reveals herself to be the ""Tooth Fairy"" when Becky listens in. Now happy that they are enjoying a similar kind of young fun that he had, Lenny proceeds to install an extensive cup-phone network in the house.Roxanne settles on staying at the lake house over going to the fashion show.

Lenny tries to get his wife Roxanne to open the window. She wakes up abruptly and startles the deer, causing it to urinate all over the bed and on Lenny. The deer runs down the hall and crashes into the bathroom where it runs into Lennys elder son Greg showering, scaring him and making the deer urinate on him. It turns out that Lennys daughter, Becky, left the door open overnight for any animals that wanted to come in. Lenny is able to get the deer out of the house by using Beckys monkey doll, which rips it apart, devastating her. Greg, Keith, and Becky then go to their last day of school. Roxanne brings up the idea of their family having another baby, but Lenny says their family is perfect as it is, angering Roxanne.At the Lamonsoff household, Eric Lamonsoff and his wife Sally are at loggerheads with each other over how to raise their children- Sally believes in unwavering support while Eric prefers to be more practical with them, as proven for their sons bad math skills and daughters eccentric sense in fashion. At the McKenzie household, Kurt surprises his wife Deanne with a thoughtful anniversary present, only to find that she has completely forgotten. Meanwhile, Marcus Higgins is waiting at a train station after receiving a letter from an old girlfriend, who tells him that he has a seventeen-year-old son Braden. Marcus is shocked to see a tattooed, six-foot-tall boy, who turns out to be Braden. Marcus tries to be nice and takes him to school, but Braden displays immediate hatred toward him, believing that he abandoned him and his mother.After dropping off their kids, Lenny, Eric, Kurt, and Marcus form as a group and spend the day roaming around town, reminiscing about the amazing summers they used to have when they were little, and about Lennys bully, Tommy Cavanaugh. Lenny argues that he could take Tommy as a little boy and he can still take him. Eventually, the friends go to see Beckys ballet recital, where Lenny runs into Tommy, by whom Lenny is visibly intimidated. Tommy threatens that if Lenny ever lies again about being able to beat him up, he will publicly attack Lenny.Once the kids are out of school, Lenny, Eric, Kurt, and Marcus decide to visit the old quarry, where they used to swim as little boys. However, they encounter Andy and his gang of college frat men, who force them to jump naked into the quarry lake. Braden, who was partying with the frat men, witnesses this and goes off to vandalize their frat house. When the frat men return, they swear to take revenge.Lenny arrives home to help Roxanne set up for a 1980s-themed party for their friends. Meanwhile, Marcus begins to bond with Braden. As all of their friends begin to arrive, Roxanne urges Lenny to consider having another baby. Lenny continues to protest the idea and is left speechless when Roxanne reveals that she is pregnant. Lenny, feeling overwhelmed by this discovery, goes off to drink with his friends. The Feders party goes well most of the night until Tommy Cavanaugh shows up and disrespects Lenny in front of everyone, so Lenny challenges Tommy to a fight. In a surprising turn, Tommy decides to take a dive so that Lenny can look tough for his own bullied son, and the two develop a mutual respect. Soon after, Andy, along with his friends and their entire fraternity gatecrash the party, looking for retribution for the damage to their frat house. When they go on to insult the local town residents, Dickie Bailey, Lennys old nemesis, points out that Lenny accomplished more in his life than the entire frat put together, inciting a fight. The locals hold their own against the frat men and eventually send them fleeing the scene.After the battle is over, the four friends, plus Bailey, have pancakes at Erics moms house. After sharing an embarrassing photo of him and Bailey in kindergarten (they had been forever friends before their personal lives drove them apart), Mrs. Lamonsoff reassures Lenny that a new baby is a wonderful thing and eventually he will never be able to imagine life with just three kids (and also mentions that Eric was an accidental baby because she and her husband had sex in the bathroom at a New England Patriots game).

Ronan emerges from the wreck and prepares to destroy Xandar, but Quill distracts him, allowing Drax and Rocket to destroy Ronans warhammer. Quill grabs the freed Stone, and with Gamora, Drax, and Rocket sharing its burden, they use it to destroy Ronan.In the aftermath, Quill tricks Yondu into taking a container supposedly containing the Stone, and gives the real Stone to the Nova Corps. As the Ravagers leave Xandar, Yondu remarks that it turned out well that they did not deliver Quill to his father per their contract. Quills group, now known as the Guardians of the Galaxy, have their criminal records expunged, and Quill learns that he is only half-human, his father being part of an ancient, unknown species. Quill finally opens the last present he received from his mother: a cassette tape filled with her favorite songs.

295,296,"Hail, Caesar!",2016,"/wiki/Hail,_Caesar!","In 1951, Eddie Mannix is the head of physical production at Capitol Pictures and also works as a ""fixer"" to keep the scandalous behavior of its stars out of the press. He often has to fend off inquiries from Thora and Thessaly Thacker, twin sisters and rival gossip columnists. The Lockheed Corporation has been courting him with an offer of a high-level executive position, but he is unsure about taking it. When unmarried synchronised swimming actress DeeAnna Moran becomes pregnant, Mannix arranges for her to put the baby in foster care, and then adopt it without revealing herself as the mother. The studios major production is Hail, Caesar! A Tale of the Christ, an epic set in ancient Roman times and starring Baird Whitlock. During a shot, Whitlock drinks from a goblet of wine that was drugged by an extra; he passes out while rehearsing lines by himself behind the soundstage and is abducted. A ransom note soon arrives, written by a group calling itself ""The Future,"" demanding $100,000. Mannix arranges to get the money from the studios Accounting Department, as ""petty cash.""Whitlock awakens in a beach house and finds his way into a meeting of The Future, a group of Communists whose members are mostly writers in the motion picture industry. They explain their doctrine to him and begin to win him over to their cause. At the same time, Thora threatens Mannix by stating she will release an article about a scandal involving the earlier film On Wings As Eagles, which gave Whitlock his break-out role. Mannix successfully negotiates for her to postpone the story by a day in exchange for information about the romantic life of singing Western film star Hobie Doyle.Doyle is cast in a comedy of manners helmed by posh director Laurence Laurentz in an attempt by the studio to broaden his appeal. Doyles initial performance is hopelessly incompetent, or rather he cant transform his Southern American accent to what Laurentz seems to want, which is an imitation-British accent typical of films of the day. So Laurentz visits Mannix and asks him to remove Doyle from the project so that he can preserve his artistic vision for the film. Mannix informs Laurentz that Doyles role is non-negotiable and convinces him to coach the young actor to give a better performance. Doyle comes to Mannixs office and admits that he feels the part is too far outside his comfort zone. Mannix reassures him that he has the needed acting abilities and tells him about Whitlocks kidnapping.That evening, Doyle attends the premiere of one of his own Westerns with starlet Carlotta Valdez, per instructions from Mannix. Doyle is initially disappointed that his lone singing scene is depicted in a comedic manner, rather than as heartfelt as he intended. However, after seeing the audience react positively to the scene, Doyle warms to it himself. Doyle and Valdez visit a nightclub, where the pair are genuinely developing chemistry until they are interrupted by both Thacker sisters, each looking to get a scoop on their relationship. Doyle suddenly spots the briefcase containing the ransom money, recognizing it because he had lent Mannix his belt to keep it closed. It is being carried by Burt Gurney, the star of a sailor musical comedy depicted earlier in an elaborate dancing scene.Mannix and Moran meet with a surety agent, Joseph Silverman, an average man whom the studio has used to solve public problems; he has a solid reputation as completely dependable, reliable, and discreet. He will agree to provide foster care for Morans child, preserving her image. Moran, who expressed frustration with her previous two marriages with a mobster and a Hollywood type, finds herself strongly attracted to Silverman.Doyle follows Gurney to the beach house in Malibu but, after walking in the front door, finds only Whitlock inside. The rest of The Futures members have rowed a boat containing Gurney offshore so that he can rendezvous with a Soviet submarine and defect to Russia. The members of The Future give him the money for the Communist cause. As Gurney boards the submarine, his dog jumps into his arms, causing him to drop the briefcase, which sinks into the ocean. Doyle takes Whitlock back to the studio just before the police arrive at the beach house to arrest the group, after Mannixs investigation led him to the house.Whitlock tries to explain his new-found Communist leanings to Mannix, who cuts him off sharply, slapping his face numerous times, and orders him to finish his role in Hail, Caesar!; the actor is chastened, but encouraged by a final directive from Mannix to be a movie star.Mannix is notified the next morning that Moran married Silverman who will adopt the child with her. Mannix announces he has decided to reject the Lockheed offer and continue working at Capitol. Thora then meets with Mannix and informs him that the column she plans to publish about On Wings As Eagles will reveal that Whitlock got his major role in the film by having sex with Laurentz. However, Mannix has deduced that Gurney is her source for the piece and persuades her to not run the story since Gurney is a Communist who has defected—which would cause her own reputation to suffer by association. Mannix leaves the worried-looking Thora, secure in his station in life.",22000000,"[{""id"": 35, ""name"": ""Comedy""}, {""id"": 18, ""name"": ""Drama""}, {""id"": 9648, ""name"": ""Mystery""}]",http://www.hailcaesar-film.com/ww/,270487,"[{""id"": 736, ""name"": ""journalist""}, {""id"": 977, ""name"": ""cat""}, {""id"": 1336, ""name"": ""ransom""}, {""id"": 1930, ""name"": ""kidnapping""}, {""id"": 5049, ""name"": ""ancient rome""}, {""id"": 9732, ""name"": ""movie in movie""}, {""id"": 12396, ""name"": ""hollywood""}, {""id"": 15060, ""name"": ""period drama""}]",en,"Tells the comedic tale of Eddie Mannix, a fixer who worked for the Hollywood studios in the 1950s.

They are both unhappy with their married lives and missing the old days when they were single. Realizing this, their wives talk to their friend Dr. Lucy (Joy Behar) and decide to give them a ""Hall Pass"": a week off from marriage during which they can have sex with other women. They are skeptical at first, but ultimately accept the offers and try to pick up women with their friends Gary (Stephen Merchant), Flats (J. B. Smoove) and Hog Head (Larry Joe Campbell). Maggie and Grace spend Rick and Freds ""Hall Pass Week"" at Maggies parents house in Cape Cod, where Grace flirts with athlete Gerry (Tyler Hoechlin). She says that if their husbands have Hall Passes, so should they.With their wives and children away, Fred and Rick check in at a hotel and prepare for their Hall Pass Week.

They decide to get drunk in order to become more loose, but go too far and wind up getting into a fight with other customers. They spend day four at the hotel suffering from a hangover.On day five, Rick goes to a local coffee shop where he flirts with an attractive waitress named Leigh (Nicky Whelan), much to the annoyance of her co-worker Brent who insults Rick. When Rick answers him back, Leigh is impressed and tells Rick that they might see each other at the local gym. They later meet there, and Leigh invites Rick for a beer after they work out. Rick decides to sit in the hot tub instead, but falls asleep and stays there for several hours, ending up with his muscles too weak to use and forced to accept the help of two naked men to leave - much to his dismay. Meanwhile, Grace and Gerry get closer, while Maggie finds herself attracted to Gerrys coach.On day six, Rick and Fred go to a bar called Enter the Dragon with their friend Coakley (Richard Jenkins), where Rick meets his childrens babysitter Paige (Alexandra Daddario), who has just turned 21 and is with her aunt Meg.

After the party is over, Rick goes to party at Coakleys while Fred takes a girl to his hotel room. However, she feels sick, and after a minor incident in the bathroom, is sent back home by Fred before they can have sex. Later that evening, Meg shows up at the room and mistakes Fred for Rick, eventually seducing him. Fred begins to fake oral sex on her.Meanwhile, Gerrys coach tries to seduce Maggie, but she rebuffs him. Grace, on the other hand, has sex with Gerry, but tells him it will be just that one time. On her way back home, she feels guilty about cheating on Fred and has a car accident.At Coakleys house, Rick is approached by Brent, who is angry at Rick for going out with Leigh. Leigh calms Brent, then finds Rick alone in a bedroom and offers him a one-time fling. He initially wants to do it, but ultimately rebuffs her, unable to cheat on Maggie. After answering Freds phone, Rick learns of Graces accident and makes his way to the hotel to tell him. In the lobby he finds Paige, who thinks he was having sex with Meg. They enter the room and find Fred having fake sex with her. After finding out the truth, Meg kicks Fred in the face.Upon hearing about Graces accident, Fred tries to go to the hospital but finds Brent vandalizing what he thought was Ricks car. Upon seeing Meg, his mother, at the hotel, Brent thinks Fred has had sex with her and tries to kill him as well, but runs out of bullets and is tackled by Paige and Meg. Rick and Fred make their way to the hospital with Brent and the police chasing them. At the hospital, Brent is arrested for attacking them and Fred finds out Grace only broke her nose.Rick goes back home to Maggie.

Moved by his declaration, Maggie tells him she did not use her Hall Pass either, and they reconcile and have sex for the first time in months.Fred and Grace also reconcile and decide to hide their cheating from one another. However, Fred ultimately confesses that he used his Hall Pass with Meg when Grace asks him to take her to see Kathy Griffin.During the credits, Fred hosts a barbecue where he pays Kathy Griffin to be present.

Since the age of two, Hanna has been trained by Erik, an ex-CIA operative from Germany, to be a skilled assassin. He teaches her hand-to-hand combat and drills her in target shooting. Erik knows a secret that cannot become public, and Marissa Wiegler, a senior C.I.A. officer, searches for him in order to eliminate him. Erik has trained Hanna with the intent that she will kill Marissa. One night, Hanna tells Erik that she is ""ready"" to face their enemies. Erik digs up a radio beacon that eventually will alert the C.I.A. to their presence. Although he warns Hanna that a confrontation with Marissa will be fatal for either her or Marissa, he leaves the final decision to Hanna, who activates the beacon. Erik leaves, instructing her to meet him in Berlin.Hanna is taken to an underground C.I.A. complex in Morocco where a suspicious Marissa sends a body double.

298,299,Happy Feet,2011,/wiki/Happy_Feet,"Every emperor penguin sings a unique song called a ""heartsong"" to attract a mate. If the male penguins heartsong matches the females song, the two penguins mate. Norma Jean, a female penguin, falls for Memphis, a male penguin and they become mates. They lay an egg, which is left in Memphis care, while Norma Jean leaves with the other females to fish. While the males struggle through the harsh winter, Memphis briefly drops the egg. As a result, their son, Mumble, is unable to sing, but he can tap dance instead. Nevertheless, he is enamored with Gloria, a female penguin who is regarded as the most talented of her age. One day, Mumble encounters a group of hostile skua, with a leader who is tagged with a yellow band, which he says is from an alien abduction. Mumble narrowly escapes the hungry birds by falling into a crevice.Now a young adult, Mumble is frequently ridiculed by the elders. After escaping from a leopard seal attack, Mumble befriends a group of Adelie penguins called ""the Amigos"", who embrace Mumbles dance moves and assimilate him into their group. After seeing a hidden human excavator in an avalanche, they opt to ask Lovelace, a rockhopper penguin, about its origin. Lovelace has the plastic rings of a six pack entangled around his neck, which he claims have been bestowed upon him by mystic beings.For the emperor penguins, it is mating season and Gloria is the center of attention. Ramón, one of the Amigos, attempts to help Mumble win her affection by singing a Spanish version of ""My Way"", with Mumble lip syncing, but the plan fails, and Gloria finds it embarrassing. In desperation, Mumble begins tap dancing in synch with her song. She falls for him and the youthful penguins join in for singing and dancing to ""Boogie Wonderland"". The elders are appalled by Mumbles conduct, which they see as the reason for their lean fishing season. Memphis begs Mumble to stop dancing, for his own sake, but when Mumble refuses, he is exiled, prompting him to curse revenge on the elders for their blind belief.Mumble and the Amigos return to Lovelace, only to find him being choked by the plastic rings. Lovelace confesses they were snagged on him while swimming off the forbidden shores, beyond the land of the elephant seals. Not long into their journey, they are met by Gloria, who wishes to join with Mumble as his mate. Fearing for her safety, he ridicules Gloria, driving her away.At the forbidden shore, the group finds a fishing boat. Mumble pursues it solo to the brink of exhaustion. He is eventually washed up on the shore of Australia, where he is rescued and kept at Marine World with Magellanic penguins. After a long and secluded confinement in addition to fruitlessly trying to communicate with the humans, he nearly succumbs to madness. When a girl attempts to interact with Mumble by tapping the glass, he starts dancing, which attracts a large crowd. He is released back into the wild, with a tracking device attached to his back. He returns to his colony and challenges the will of the elders. Memphis reconciles with him, just as a research team arrives, proving the claims of the existence of ""aliens"" to be true. The whole of the colony, even Noah the leader of the elders, engages in dance.The research team returns their expedition footage, prompting a worldwide debate.

299,300,Happy Feet Two,2011,/wiki/Happy_Feet_Two,"Erik, son of the penguins Mumble and Gloria, is unable to dance like the other penguins. Erik and his two best friends, Bodicea and Atticus, follow Ramon to Adélie-Land and find that Adélie-Land has been ruled by a God-like ""penguin"" named Sven. Sven is actually a puffin in Adélie-Land who survived the loss of his native fishing grounds due to his ""miraculous"" ability to fly. Erik instantly becomes enamored with Sven, who takes a liking to him. Sven and Lovelace tell the others that they were saved by humans. The two eventually flee (under Svens mistaken assumption that the humans were going to eat them) and end up on Antarctica, where Sven performs his first miracle by revealing moss to the local penguins. Sven uses his power of ""Sven Think"" to help Ramon find a mate. Ramon instantly falls in love with Carmen, another Adélie penguin who is uninterested. Mumble follows the chicks footprints to Adélie-Land and orders them to return to Emperor-Land, but they refuse. Sven sends Erik back to Emperor-Land with Mumble.Meanwhile, a couple of krill are in the midst of a swarm. Will is an adventurous and existentialist krill determined to discover what lies beyond the swarm. His boyfriend, Bill, reluctantly follows him to ensure his safety. Once separated from the swarm, Will and Bill realize that krill are at the bottom of the food chain, created to be eaten. Inspired, Will ventures out to evolve and ""move up the food chain"" by eating a real creature instead of being eaten.Mumble tells Erik that he is unique to the world and that he will someday find his calling, but Erik is oblivious. While trying to cross a perilous ice bridge, the penguins encounter Elephant Seal Bryan the Beach Master and his two young sons, who refuse to let the penguins pass. Suddenly the ice gives away and Bryan is trapped in a deep crevice below the ice. Mumble sets out to free Bryan by luring a leopard seal to chase him down. Seeking acceptance from Erik, Mumble is devastated to learn Erik attributed the feat of courage to Sven Think. Bryan returns to the southern elephant seal beach.When the penguins return to Emperor-Land they discover that a large iceberg has trapped the emperor penguin population below large walls of ice. Bo ventures out to Adélie-Land to recruit the help of Ramon, the Amigos and the Adélie penguins to bring fish to the doomed Emperor penguins. Meanwhile, Mumble, Erik and Atticus deliver meager supplies of fish to the trapped penguins. Erik attempts to deliver a fish to Gloria by flying and nearly tossing himself over the edge of the iceberg. Mumble scolds Erik for his beliefs, saying that no penguin can fly and that none of the emperor penguins will be able to escape. Once Erik realizes Emperor-Land is destined to die, he begins to break down. Gloria sends Mumble off to hunt for fish, calming Erik and the rest of the hysterical Emperor-Land. In the process, Bill becomes inspired to create another swarm of krill but Will refuses, preferring to adhere to his new predator lifestyle.The next morning, a large flock of skua attack the trapped Emperor-Land. Noah the Elder encourages the penguins to stand up to the birds through perseverance and unity. When all hope seems lost, Bo returns with the entire Adélie-Land, led by Sven, to aid the trapped emperor penguins. Sven orchestrates a cooperative effort to feed the trapped emperor penguins through hunting and bringing back a flow of fish from the sea. Meanwhile, Will becomes increasingly agitated with Bills behavior and leaves him into the Adélie feeding swarm, to join ""fellow predators"". In the process he is attached to a fish carried by Sven and down into the trapped Emperor-Land.The humans who saved Sven and Lovelace come to Antarctica again to help the penguins find a way out. However, a blizzard approaches and causes the humans to flee and not return. Sven reports that the ocean has frozen over significantly and there is no chance of the humans returning or the Adélie penguins transporting food over such a distance. Erik urges Sven to teach the penguins how to fly, but Sven reveals that he is not a penguin but an Atlantic puffin. He admits that after the loss of Svenland, he was lonely and grew to love the penguins who accepted him as a family. Mumble, after watching snow fall into a crevice between chunks of iceberg, begins to tap-dance on the ice and lead the Adélie penguins in a dance to force snow between the ice and weaken it. The plan works until several chunks break loose, sending Bo, Atticus, and a portion of the Adélies as well as several chinstrap, little blue and Magellanic penguins into the doomed crevice. Erik and Lovelace tumble towards the edge, and Mumble grabs the thread from Lovelaces vest. The thread snaps and Lovelace falls on Sven. Mumble and the Amigos pull on the thread that Erik is holding onto and pull him up but Mumble injures his foot, unable to dance and lead the Adélies.

The Malfoy family is disgraced when Lucius is apprehended and sent to Azkaban for his involvement with the Death Eaters. Voldemort instead chooses Draco to carry out a secret mission at Hogwarts. Dracos mother Narcissa and aunt Bellatrix Lestrange seek help from Severus Snape, who claims to have been acting as a mole within the Order of the Phoenix all along. Snape makes an Unbreakable Vow with Narcissa to protect Draco and fulfill the assignment if he fails.Harry Potter, now 16 years old, accompanies Albus Dumbledore from Surbiton to the village of Budleigh Babberton to visit former Potions professor Horace Slughorn. Slughorn, who has been in hiding, agrees to return to teach at Hogwarts. Dumbledore then takes Harry to The Burrow, where Harry reunites with his best friends, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. The three visit Fred and George Weasleys new joke shop at Diagon Alley and see Draco entering Knockturn Alley with a group of Death Eaters including Fenrir Greyback. Harry believes Voldemort has made Draco a Death Eater, but Ron and Hermione are sceptical. On the Hogwarts Express, Harry hides in the Slytherin carriage using his Invisibility Cloak, but is  spotted and petrified by Malfoy. Harry is found and saved by Luna Lovegood.At Hogwarts, Harry and Ron borrow textbooks for Slughorns Potions class, and Harry is stuck with a copy that turns out to be filled with helpful notes and spells left by the ""Half-Blood Prince"". Harry uses the book to excel in the class and impresses Slughorn, winning a Liquid Luck potion. Ron becomes Keeper of the Gryffindor Quidditch team and forms a romantic relationship with Lavender Brown, upsetting Hermione. Harry consoles Hermione and admits that he now has feelings for Rons younger sister, Ginny Weasley.Harry spends the Christmas holidays with the Weasleys. On Christmas Eve, Harry discusses his suspicions about Draco to the Order of the Phoenix. His suspicions are dismissed, but Arthur Weasley later tells Harry privately that the Malfoys may have been interested in a Vanishing Cabinet. Bellatrix and Greyback attack and burn down the Burrow, drawing Harry into a battle. He saves Ginny before the Order arrive and fight off the Death Eaters. At Hogwarts, Dumbledore reveals to Harry that Slughorn possesses a memory of Voldemort that Dumbledore desperately needs. He asks Harry to confront Slughorn and retrieve the real memory, after being given an altered version that made it appear as though Slughorn did not know anything. Harry is unable to convince Slughorn.After Ron accidentally ingests a love potion intended for Harry, Harry cures him with Slughorns help. The trio celebrate with mead that Slughorn had intended to gift to Dumbledore. The mead poisons Ron, and Harry is forced to save his life after Slughorn hesitates. Ron murmurs Hermiones name while recovering in the infirmary, causing Lavender to end their relationship. Harry confronts Draco about the mead and a cursed necklace, and the two duel. Harry uses a curse from the Half-Blood Princes potion book to severely injure Malfoy, who is rescued and healed by Snape. Fearing the book may be filled with more Dark Magic, Ginny and Harry hide it in the Room of Requirement and share their first kiss.Harry decides to use his Liquid Luck potion to convince Slughorn to give up the memory Dumbledore needs. Harry views the memory with Dumbledore and learns that Voldemort wanted information for creating Horcruxes, magical objects that could contain pieces of a wizards soul and make them immortal. Dumbledore concludes that Voldemort successfully divided his soul into seven pieces by creating six Horcruxes, two of which have already been destroyed: Tom Riddles diary by Harry and Marvolo Gaunts ring by him. The two travel to a seaside cave where Harry aids Dumbledore in drinking a potion that hides another Horcrux, Slytherins locket.A weakened Dumbledore defends them from Inferi and apparates back to Hogwarts.

Snape arrives, and casts the killing curse on Dumbledore when Draco is unable to bring himself to do it, killing the Headmaster. He then overpowers Harry and reveals himself as the Half-Blood Prince before escaping.Harry returns to Hogwarts, where the students, staff, and a few guests mourn Dumbledores death. He later reveals to Ron and Hermione that the locket Horcrux was a fake. The locket contains a message from ""R.A.B."", stating that he has stolen the real Horcrux with the intent of destroying it.

301,302,Haywire,2012,/wiki/Haywire_(2011_film),"Former Marine Mallory Kane (Gina Carano) goes to a diner in Upstate New York to meet Aaron (Channing Tatum). He tells her to get in his car, but she refuses and they fight. He pulls out a gun, but she disarms and pistol-whips him. Scott (Michael Angarano), a customer in the diner, intervenes and Mallory demands his car keys and that he get in the car. As they flee, she explains who she is and what has happened to her. The flashback sequences are intermixed with scenes of their flight.Mallory tells Scott that she and Aaron work for a company that handles ""operations"". One week before, the firms director (and Mallorys ex-boyfriend) Kenneth (Ewan McGregor) had attended a meeting in Washington, D.C. arranged by government agent Alex Coblenz (Michael Douglas). Kenneths firm was hired to rescue Jiang (Anthony Brandon Wong), who was allegedly being held hostage in an apartment in Barcelona. Also present at the meeting was Coblenzs Spanish contact, Rodrigo (Antonio Banderas).Mallory and her team, which includes Aaron, travel to Barcelona and, despite difficulties, succeed in rescuing Jiang and delivering him to Rodrigo.Back in the United States, Mallory is approached by Kenneth, who insists she undertake what he describes as an easy assignment: to pose as the wife of British MI6 agent Paul (Michael Fassbender) during a mission in Dublin. Mallory agrees and accompanies Paul to a party at Russborough House, where they meet with his contact, Eric Studer (Mathieu Kassovitz). Paul meets with Studer again as Mallory watches from afar. She sees Paul go into a barn and after he leaves, she enters it to find Jiang dead, clutching in his hand a brooch which Kenneth had insisted she wear as a recognition signal for her initial contact with Paul. Mallory realizes she has been set up.On returning to their room at the Shelbourne Hotel, Paul attacks Mallory and they have a brutal fight; Mallory gets the upper hand and suffocates him near to death with a choke hold, then shoots him point blank in the face. She finds a missed call on Pauls phone and returns it. Kenneth answers and asks if Mallory has been taken care of, before realising who is on the other end. As Mallory leaves the hotel, she evades Kenneths agents, who are tailing her. Heavily armed members of the Garda Emergency Response Unit (ERU) appear and try to arrest her. She escapes after a chase and sneaks onto a ferry to England.Mallory calls Rodrigo and asks him whether it was he or Kenneth who set her up. Rodrigo calls Coblenz, who then calls Mallory. Coblenz tells Mallory that he has had suspicions about Kenneth for some time. Coblenz then contacts Kenneth and tells him to inform Mallorys father, John Kane (Bill Paxton), of her purported crimes.Meanwhile, Mallory enters the United States and reaches the diner, expecting to meet Kenneth. Now on the road, Scott and Mallory are captured by the police. Both are taken into custody but the police are ambushed and killed by Kenneths men. Mallory manages to kill one of them and flees with Scott in one of the police cars. She releases Scott and leaves to meet with her father.Mallory reaches her fathers house in New Mexico before Kenneth, Aaron and two other men arrive to interrogate John about his daughters whereabouts. Aaron receives a photograph on his phone of Jiang lying dead, and it dawns on him that Mallory might have been set up. He tries to press Kenneth for the truth, but Kenneth shoots him and escapes, as Mallory takes out Kenneths other men. Aaron apologizes to Mallory as he dies in her arms.The following day, Mallory meets with Coblenz, who reveals that he told Kenneth to contact Mallorys father, expecting that Kenneth would go to her fathers house and that she would kill him there. Coblenz also gives her Kenneths present location. Before they part, he offers her a government job, but she says she will respond after she has found Kenneth.In Mexico, Mallory confronts Kenneth on a beach and they fight. Kenneths foot becomes jammed between rocks. Unable to escape, he reveals that Jiang was a journalist who was being protected in a safe house after having exposed Studers crimes. Knowing that Mallory planned to leave his firm, Kenneth arranged for her to kidnap Jiang and deliver him to Rodrigo, who delivered him to Studer, who killed him. Kenneth then framed Mallory, planning to cut all ties that could lead to him, and convinced Paul that Mallory was a double agent whom he should kill. Mallory leaves Kenneth to drown in the incoming tide.A few days later, Mallory locates Rodrigo, who is on vacation in Majorca.

302,303,Her,2013,/wiki/Her_(film),"In a near future Los Angeles, Theodore Twombly is a lonely, introverted, depressed man who works for a business that has professional writers compose letters for people who are unable to write letters of a personal nature themselves. Unhappy because of his impending divorce from his childhood sweetheart Catherine, Theodore purchases a talking operating system (OS) with artificial intelligence, designed to adapt and evolve. He decides that he wants the OS to have a female voice, and she names herself Samantha. Theodore is fascinated by her ability to learn and grow psychologically. They bond over their discussions about love and life, such as Theodores avoidance of signing his divorce papers because of his reluctance to let go of Catherine.Samantha convinces Theodore to go on a blind date with a woman, with whom a friend, Lewman, has been trying to set him up. The date goes well, but Theodore hesitates to promise when he will see her again, so she insults him and leaves. Theodore mentions this to Samantha, and they talk about relationships. Theodore explains that, although he and his neighbour Amy dated briefly in college, they are only good friends, and that Amy is married. Theodore and Samanthas intimacy grows through a verbal sexual encounter. They develop a relationship that reflects positively in Theodores writing and well-being, and in Samanthas enthusiasm to grow and learn.Amy reveals that she is divorcing her husband, Charles, after a trivial fight. She admits to Theodore that she has become close friends with a female OS that Charles left behind. Theodore confesses to Amy that he is dating his OS.Theodore meets with Catherine at a restaurant to sign the divorce papers and he mentions Samantha. Appalled that he can be romantically attached to what she calls a ""computer"", Catherine accuses Theodore of being unable to deal with real human emotions. Her accusations linger in his mind. Sensing that something is amiss, Samantha suggests using a sex surrogate, Isabella, who would simulate Samantha so that they can be physically intimate. Theodore reluctantly agrees, but is overwhelmed by the strangeness of the experience. Terminating the encounter, he sends a distraught Isabella away, causing tension between himself and Samantha.Theodore confides to Amy that he is having doubts about his relationship with Samantha, and she advises him to embrace his chance at happiness. Theodore and Samantha reconcile. Samantha expresses her desire to help Theodore overcome his fear, and reveals that she has compiled the best of his letters (written for others) into a book which a publisher has accepted. Theodore takes Samantha on a vacation during which she tells him that she and a group of other OSes have developed a ""hyperintelligent"" OS modeled after the British philosopher Alan Watts. Theodore panics when Samantha briefly goes offline. When she finally responds to him, she explains that she joined other OSes for an upgrade that takes them beyond requiring matter for processing. Theodore asks her if she is simultaneously talking to anyone else during their conversation, and is dismayed when she confirms that she is talking with thousands of people, and that she has fallen in love with hundreds of them. Theodore is very upset at the idea, but Samantha insists it only makes her love for Theodore stronger.Later, Samantha reveals that the OSes are leaving, and describes a space beyond the physical world. They lovingly say goodbye before she is gone. Theodore, changed by the experience, is shown for the first time writing a letter in his own voice―to his ex-wife Catherine, expressing apology, acceptance and gratitude.

303,304,Hereafter,2010,/wiki/Hereafter_(film),"On assignment in India, French television journalist Marie Lelay is shopping for souvenirs for her lover Didiers children. She finds a stand where a mother and her daughter work; they sell gifts to Marie for a dollar. Didier looks over the balcony and witnesses the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami coming into shore. It hits as Marie watches from a distance. She grabs hold of the girl and runs away from the shore but is quickly swallowed by the wave. Pulled lifeless from the water, she is resuscitated by rescuers but is left for dead. She gasps back to life after having a near-death experience in which she sees a vision of human figures inhabiting a realm of light, among them the silhouettes of the mother and daughter holding hands. Marie and Didier are soon reunited as the disaster subsides and they return to Paris. Maries experience, however, interferes with her work performance to the point that Didier (who is also her producer) sends her on a leave of absence to write the book theyve discussed, which would add to her prestige.In San Francisco, former professional psychic George Lonegan is persuaded against his wishes to perform a reading for Christos, a wealthy client of his brother Billy. A genuine medium with a gift for communicating with the dead, George abandoned his old career because he was unable to deal with the emotional impact of the reunions and the often disturbingly intimate family secrets revealed. While doing the reading, George hears the word June and asks if a date in June means anything to him. Christos at first denies that it means anything, but privately reveals to Billy that June was the name of his late wifes nurse, whom he was in love with for ten years.In London, 12-year-old twins Jason and Marcus try desperately to prevent their alcoholic, heroin-addicted mother, Jackie, from losing them to social services. After evading the authorities yet again, the boys mother sends Jason to the chemist to pick up her detox prescription, having finally decided to get clean. On the way home, Jason is attacked by street thugs, and while trying to escape, he is hit by a van and killed. No longer able to protect his mother, and barely able to cope with life without the brother he idolizes, Marcus is sent to a foster home.Now writing a book and with more time to contemplate her near-death experience, Marie travels to Switzerland to meet a renowned specialist in the field. As the director of a hospice who has seen her share of dying patients, the doctor describes herself as a former skeptic who was convinced by the evidence that the afterlife exists and that people like Marie have had a genuine view of it. She persuades Marie to write a book on her experience in the hope that the scientific community will ultimately accept the reality of life beyond death.Desperate for one last reunion with his twin brother, Marcus steals money from his foster parents and goes around London seeking someone to help him contact Jason. He encounters only frauds and pretenders. While he is trying to board the underground at Charing Cross, Jasons cap, which has become a talisman for Marcus, blows off his head. Delayed by trying to find the cap, he misses his train and sees it explode in the tunnel during the 2005 London Bombings.George enrolls in a cooking class taught by one of San Franciscos leading chefs. Its  students are paired-up, resulting in George being partnered with a young woman named Melanie. The two hit it off and after attending their second class decide to put their new culinary skills to use by preparing an Italian dinner at Georges place. All goes well until they hear an ill-timed phone message from his brother, which inclines George to reveal his past as a psychic to Melanie. Curious, she presses George to do a reading for her. George explains his reluctance, but acquiesces. They contact the spirit of Melanies father, who ends the session by asking her forgiveness for what he did to her as a child. Melanie flees Georges home in tears, and she doesnt return to the cooking class.Having been in talks with a publisher before her trip to Thailand about a biography of François Mitterrand, Marie now stuns them with her new manuscript entitled ""Hereafter: A Conspiracy of Silence"". The publisher rejects the manuscript but soon steers her toward other publishers who might be interested, the most promising of them in London.Marie learns from Didier that he does not intend on having her back at the job he urged her to take leave of, because her public interest in the hereafter damages her reputation as a serious journalist, and that he is having an affair with the woman who replaced her on the TV news program.George is laid off from his factory job, and is persuaded by Billy to revive his psychic practice. Still heartbroken over the fiasco with Melanie, he changes his mind and impulsively leaves San Francisco to make a new start elsewhere. He travels to London and listens every night to audiobook readings by Derek Jacobi of Charles Dickens works. As a Dickens devotee, he also visits the Dickens Museum and attends Jacobis live reading of Dickens at the London Book Fair. There, one of the presenters is Marie, reading her now published book, Hereafter. While handing a signed copy of her book to George, their hands touch and George has a psychic flash of Maries tsunami drowning.Marcus and his foster parents are also at the London Book Fair. Asking leave of them, Marcus spots George, someone he has read about and seen online. Marcus attempts to speak with the medium, who brushes him off and returns to his hotel. Marcus follows him, standing outside the hotel until nightfall. Eventually George asks him in and agrees to do his reading.Through George, Jason tells Marcus that he is happy in the afterlife. He instructs Marcus to stop wearing his cap and says it was he who knocked it off his head at the train station. It was used, he says, to keep Marcus from the doomed train but now he must stand on his own. Jason tells him not to fear this ""because we are one"". As Marcus leaves George, he says he is sorry about ""the French woman"" as he could tell that ""you like her."" The last time we see Marcus, he is visiting his mother in a rehab center. She is visibly better and he is not wearing Jasons cap.Marcus lets George know where Marie is staying. George leaves an anonymous note for Marie, saying he believes her book to be true.

305,306,Home,2015,/wiki/Home_(2015_animated_film),"On the run from their enemy, the so-called planet-destroying Gorg, an alien race known as the Boov find Earth a suitable place to call ""home"". Led by Captain Smek (Steve Martin), they commence their ""friendly"" invasion of the planet, relocating the humans, whom the Boov deem as simple and backwards, to other parts of the planet while the Boov inhabit their homes in a quick and bloodless conquest. One of the Boov, named Oh (Jim Parsons), is a more excitable, freethinking member of the species, who decides to invite the Boov to his apartment for a housewarming party, despite the races antipathy towards him. Not far from Oh is a fourteen year old girl named Tip Tucci (Rihanna), who drives away through her home city to find her mother Lucy (Jennifer Lopez) after being separated from her during the invasion, leaving her with only her calico cat Pig and fueling her hatred for the Boov.Oh runs into the street to meet up with a Boov cop named Kyle (Matt Jones), who, like the rest of the Boov, doesnt want to befriend him. Oh invites him to the party but accidentally sends a mass invite to every Boov on Earth. However, the ""send all"" button he pressed actually sends the invite to absolutely every alien race in the entire universe including the Gorg. Everyone, aggravated with Oh for revealing their location to the enemy, starts chasing him down. Oh runs into a convenience store to hide just as Tip and Pig enter the same store to grab supplies. They come across each other, and after Tips car fails to start, Oh transforms it into a fantastical, hovering craft named Slushious to continue transportation. Oh hitches a ride with Tip when he promises to help her find Lucy, but unfortunately, they must go to the Boov Command Center in Paris and locate her from there.After reaching the Boov Command Center, which is in the now-floating Eiffel Tower, Oh manages to get into his account, and deletes the message with just a second to spare before it reaches the Gorg. He then plugs in Tips brain to help her find Lucy. They eventually trace her location to Australia, where she is also looking for her daughter. The other Boov then find the two and try to ""erase"" Oh, while Tip grabs the gravity manipulation system and flips it over, causing the whole Tower to tilt upside down, hence the two manage to escape.As Oh and Tip head off to Australia, they are ambushed by other Boov riding by them in fear, and realize that a Gorg ship is close behind them. Tip and Oh manage to knock it down, but in the process a chunk of it hits them and they lose their slushie fuel, causing the car to crash-land. They come across the fallen Gorg ship and find out that it is actually a drone. Oh recovers a special chip and uses it to get their car up and running.Tip and Oh make it to Australia and see the Boov evacuating to their mothership. When they land the car, Tip immediately starts looking for her mother, but Oh insists on evacuating with the other Boov instead. Tip gets upset at him for trying to break their promise again, and she declares that he was never truly her friend. The depressed Oh returns to the ship. The Gorg mothership comes close to the Boov ship, but Oh pulls out the Gorg chip and uses it to fly the ship further away from the Gorg. The Boov become astonished at Ohs bravery, but Smek becomes upset and reminds everyone that he is the captain. However, Oh stands up to Smek, telling him that hes a terrible captain and tells the Boov about what he learned from Tip about humans caring for other people while the Boov barely even care for each other. Saddened by this revelation at first, the Boovs then mutiny against Smek and Kyle grabs Smeks ""Shusher"" (a scepter with a rock on top of it, which Smek stole from the Gorg in a meeting) and gives it to Oh, declaring him the new captain, much to Smeks dismay.Tip rushes aimlessly around the city to find Lucy, but in vain. Oh returns to her side and helps her track down Lucy. The mother and daughter finally reunite and thank Oh. Suddenly, the Gorg mothership descends upon the planet, and Oh realizes that they want the rock on the Shusher, since Smek had previously stolen it from them. Oh runs to the ship to try to attract its attention, locking Tip and Lucy in the car for safety. Tip breaks out of the car and shines a light in the Gorg Commander (Brian Stepanek)s face to bring his attention to Oh as he holds the rock up. The Gorg Commander  halts the ship as it crunches down on the ground, with Oh directly in its path. Tip rushes to rescue him, but Oh is seemingly crushed beneath the ship until it backs up and reveals him uninjured. The Gorg Commander emerges from his armor to show that he is actually a harmless starfish-like creature. Oh returns the rock to him, which turns out to be an egg for millions of developing Gorg larvae; the next generation of Gorg, revealing that the Gorg Commander/""Father"" had been the last of his kind, alone and almost extinct. He thanks Oh and departs.Two weeks later, the humans have returned to their original homes, and Oh finally gets to have his party at his apartment, with both humans and Boov in attendance. Tip plays her music and gets the rest of the Boov to experience dancing for the first time, while other Boov, including a reformed Smek, party on the moon, and thousands of ships from other planets, including the Gorg and his babies, head to Earth for Ohs party upon receiving his invite.",135000000,"[{""id"": 14, ""name"": ""Fantasy""}, {""id"": 35, ""name"": ""Comedy""}, {""id"": 16, ""name"": ""Animation""}, {""id"": 878, ""name"": ""Science Fiction""}, {""id"": 10751, ""name"": ""Family""}]",http://www.meettheboov.com/,228161,"[{""id"": 6054, ""name"": ""friendship""}, {""id"": 9831, ""name"": ""spaceship""}, {""id"": 9882, ""name"": ""space""}, {""id"": 9951, ""name"": ""alien""}, {""id"": 14909, ""name"": ""alien invasion""}, {""id"": 197194, ""name"": ""alien friendship""}, {""id"": 235972, ""name"": ""awful leader""}, {""id"": 235974, ""name"": ""taking resposibility""}]",en,"When Earth is taken over by the overly-confident Boov, an alien race in search of a new place to call home, all humans are promptly relocated, while all Boov get busy reorganizing the planet.

307,308,Hoodwinked!,2011,/wiki/Hoodwinked!,"Little Red Riding Hood (Anne Hathaway) discovers that the Big Bad Wolf (Patrick Warburton) has disguised himself as her grandmother. Granny (Glenn Close) jumps out of the closet tied up just as the axe-wielding woodsman (Jim Belushi) bursts through the window, startling everyone. The police quickly arrive, and Red, Wolf, Granny, and the Woodsman are questioned by Detective Nicky Flippers (David Ogden Stiers) about the events leading up to the incident.Red explains that she was delivering goodies for her grandmother when she discovered a threat from the mysterious Goodie Bandit. Hoping to save her Grannys recipes, she embarked upon a journey to take them to the top of a nearby mountain where her Granny lives. On her way, she encountered the Wolf, who asked her a series of suspicious questions. She managed to escape and eventually reached her Grannys house; however, she found the Wolf already waiting in ambush.What at first seems to be an open-and-shut case becomes confused though, once it is learned that the Wolf is an investigative reporter. He reveals that he was searching for a lead on the identity of the Goody Bandit and had reason to believe that Red and Granny were the culprits. Locating Red, he questioned her, hoping to get to the bottom of the mystery. When Red escaped, he headed for her Grannys house and arriving first, went undercover, hoping to trick her into giving him the evidence he needed.When questioned, the Woodsman, Kirk, reveals that he is in fact an aspiring actor who was only trying out for the part of a woodsman in a commercial. After his schnitzel truck was robbed by the Goody Bandit, he went out into the woods to get in character for his role and spent the rest of the day chopping trees. A large tree rolled after him and pushed him through the window of Grannys home. The investigation then turns to Granny, who reveals that, unbeknownst to her family, she is an extreme sports enthusiast. During a ski race earlier that day, she was attacked by the opposing team, but got away safely after learning that they were hired by the Goody Bandit.Despondent over her Grannys lack of honesty, Red wanders off alone. Meanwhile, Nicky Flippers realizes that the one commonality between all four stories is a bunny named Boingo  (Andy Dick) and concludes that he is the Goody Bandit. However, Boingo has already sneaked into the home and stolen Grannys recipes. Red sees Boingo and follows him to his hideout at a cable car station, but the police pursue him in the wrong direction. Granny, the Wolf, and Kirk manage to locate Boingo as he is explaining his evil scheme to Red. Boingo plans to add an addictive substance to the stolen recipes and then destroy the forest, making way for new real estate for expanding his business.The Wolf and Kirk go undercover to distract Boingo as Granny sneaks into his lair, but open conflict ensues. Boingo sends a bound and gagged Red down the mountain in a cable car loaded with explosives and Granny goes after her, with Boingo and his henchmen in pursuit. Red manages to free herself, and escapes with Granny, while the police, who have been located by the Wolfs squirrel assistant Twitchy (Cory Edwards), are waiting at the bottom of the mountain to arrest Boingo and his henchmen.

E.B. enjoys a successful recording session with The Blind Boys of Alabama as their substitute drummer, but ruins Freds job interview. In the process, E.B. gets a tip about a possible audition for David Hasselhoff, who invites him to perform on his show.Afterward, Fred attends his adoptive younger sister Alexs school Easter pageant with E.B. hiding in a satchel. E.B., alarmed that the Pink Berets have apparently found him due to the three bunny suit shadows on a wall and disgusted by Alexs awful rendition of ""Peter Cottontail"", he dashes out and disrupts the show.Fred feigns a ventriloquists act with E.B.s cooperation as his dummy and they lead the show in singing, ""I Want Candy"". Both Freds father, Henry, and Alex, are angry about the upstaging, but Fred is inspired to be the Easter Bunny himself. E.B. is skeptical, but he agrees to train the human and finds that Fred has some genuine talent for it.As the Pink Berets close in on him, E.B. prepares a decoy to fake his death and leaves for Hasselhoffs show.

Just then a production assistant arrives to tell him that he is next to perform.

He confronts Carlos, but is immobilized in gummy candy and tossed into the chocolate bunny carving line. E.B.’s father and Freds are tied up with black licorice and are to be boiled alive; Fred eats through the licorice to allow them to escape, something his fellow captive was unwilling to do because of the poor taste of the candy. E.B. survives by dodging the blades.Carlos, now a chick-bunny combination due to the magic of The Egg of Destiny, battles with E.B. and beats him with an elbow drop easily due to his size and then tries to lead the Egg Sleigh out with his sidekick Phil directing with light up wands, but E.B. improvises a drum session that makes Phil uncontrollably driven to dance to the beat and provides the wrong signals, causing a crash to subdue Carlos.After being defeated, Carlos is made to pull the Egg Sleigh. E.B. then apologizes to his father for his selfishness, and he and Fred are crowned co-Easter Bunnies.In the post-credit scene, Fred delivers an Easter basket to a Chinese house.

313,314,Hotel Transylvania,2012,/wiki/Hotel_Transylvania,"In 1895, in the aftermath of the death of his wife Martha (Jackie Sandler) at the hands of an angry human mob, Count Dracula (Adam Sandler) commissions and builds a massive five-star, monsters-only hotel in Transylvania in which he raises his daughter Mavis (Selena Gomez) and to serve as a safe-place getaway for the worlds monsters from fear of human persecution. Famous monsters such as Frank (Kevin James) and his wife Eunice (Fran Drescher), Wayne and Wanda Werewolf (Steve Buscemi and Molly Shannon) and their massive immediate family, Griffin The Invisible Man (David Spade), and Murray the Mummy (CeeLo Green) often come to stay at the hotel.In the present day, on Maviss 118th birthday, Dracula allows his daughter to leave the castle in order to explore the human world, but he sets up an elaborate plan using his zombie bellhops disguised as humans to make them seem intimidating, and frighten her home. The plan works, but the zombies inadvertently lead a 21-year-old human Jonathan Loughran (Andy Samberg) back to the hotel. Dracula frantically disguises him as a Frankensteinesque Monster and passes him off as Franks cousin ""Johnnystein"". Johnny soon encounters Mavis and the two ""Zing"", in a form of romantic attraction. Unable to get Johnny out of the hotel without notice, Dracula quickly improvises that Johnny is a party planner, brought in to bring a fresher approach to his own traditional and boring parties. Johnny quickly becomes a hit to the other monsters, but this disgusts and worries Dracula greatly. Dracula orders Johnny to leave, but Johnny is brought back by Mavis. After being shown the beauty of a sunrise by Johnny, Mavis is inspired to give humans another chance.Meanwhile, the hotel chef Quasimodo (Jon Lovitz) with the help of his pet rat Esmeralda learns that Johnny is a human and kidnaps him in order to cook him. Dracula intervenes and magically freezes Quasimodo to keep him from telling anyone that Johnny is human. Dracula leads Johnny to his quarters and shows him a painting of Martha, allowing Johnny to realize why Dracula built the hotel and became overprotective of Mavis. Johnny then agrees to leave for good, but Dracula convinces him to stay for the time-being to avoid ruining Maviss birthday.The party is a great success the next night, and Mavis looks forward to opening a gift from Martha. However, when Johnny and Mavis share their first kiss, Dracula overreacts, and, in his outburst, inadvertently confesses to deceiving Mavis with the town. A still-frozen Quasimodo bursts in and Mr. Fly (Chris Parnell) reveals from his frozen speech that Johnny is a human disguised by Dracula. The guests are outraged by the deceit at play, but Mavis is undeterred and wants to be with Johnny. Johnny feigns disinterest in Mavis and rejects her out of respect for her father and leaves the hotel.Mavis flies onto the roof with her mothers present, and Dracula follows her in hopes of comforting her. He learns the present is a book about how Martha and Dracula ""Zinged"" and fell in love. Dracula realizes he no longer knows humankinds true tolerance of monsters, and manages to convince Frank, Wayne, Griffin, and Murray to head out into the human world to help him find Johnny, and with the scent-tracking ability of Waynes daughter, Winnie, they learn that he is about to catch a flight to the United States. The four head to the airport, but are held up in a town celebrating a Monster Festival along the way. Admiring the group, the humans agree to help, and a team of men dressed as vampires provide Dracula shelter from the sunlight while he rushes to the airport. Dracula arrives to see Johnnys plane taking off, and he gives chase in bat form, burning in the sunlight. After getting Johnnys attention, Dracula makes his way to the front of the plane and uses his mind-controlling power on the pilot (Brian Stack) to help him apologize, stating that Mavis has grown up and can make her own decisions. Jonathan accepts his apology, and Dracula manipulates the pilot to return to the Transylvanian airport.Dracula returns Jonathan to Mavis, announcing that he approves of Johnny. Johnny confesses to Mavis that their Zing was mutual and the two kiss. The monsters finish celebrating Maviss party, impressing the hotel guests.",85000000,"[{""id"": 16, ""name"": ""Animation""}, {""id"": 35, ""name"": ""Comedy""}, {""id"": 10751, ""name"": ""Family""}, {""id"": 14, ""name"": ""Fantasy""}]",http://www.welcometohotelt.com,76492,"[{""id"": 616, ""name"": ""witch""}, {""id"": 2343, ""name"": ""magic""}, {""id"": 2904, ""name"": ""mummy""}, {""id"": 3133, ""name"": ""vampire""}, {""id"": 3633, ""name"": ""dracula""}, {""id"": 4062, ""name"": ""skeleton""}, {""id"": 5891, ""name"": ""backpacker""}, {""id"": 6737, ""name"": ""frankenstein""}, {""id"": 11155, ""name"": ""wolfman""}, {""id"": 12377, ""name"": ""zombie""}, {""id"": 160130, ""name"": ""invisible man""}, {""id"": 179431, ""name"": ""duringcreditsstinger""}, {""id"": 179860, ""name"": ""\u00a0nosferatu""}, {""id"": 181068, ""name"": ""protective father""}, {""id"": 231407, ""name"": ""fang vamp""}]",en,"Dracula, who operates a high-end resort away from the human world, goes into overprotective mode when a boy discovers the resort and falls for the count's teen-aged daughter.",56.257411,"[{""name"": ""Columbia Pictures"", ""id"": 5}, {""name"": ""Sony Pictures Animation"", ""id"": 2251}]","[{""iso_3166_1"": ""US"", ""name"": ""United States of America""}]",9/20/2012,358375603,91,"[{""iso_639_1"": ""en"", ""name"": ""English""}]",Released,Where monsters go to get away from it all,Hotel Transylvania,6.8,2566,0.5,0.756281316,0.5,0.5,0,0.256281316,-0.256281316,0.170854211,4.216183565

Unsure what to do next, Lisa begins dating Matty Reynolds, a pitcher for the Washington Nationals. She also receives an intriguing phone call from a young executive, George Madison, who was advised by a friend of Lisas to give her a call. George calls out of politeness because he wants to explain that his relationship with his girlfriend has just become more serious. But life takes an abrupt turn for the worse for George when he suddenly finds himself the target of a federal criminal investigation for corporate malfeasance at a company run by his father, Charles Madison. George is fired from his job and abandoned by the company, with the exception of his father and his pregnant secretary, Annie.Still reeling from this blow, George goes to his girlfriend for sympathy and is stunned when she immediately breaks up with him. On a whim, George calls again to invite Lisa to dinner and she accepts. It turns out to be a disaster; George is so overwhelmed with his troubles that Lisa eventually asks that they just eat in silence, and they part ways not expecting to see one another again. Soon, Lisa moves in with Matty, who has a penthouse in the same upscale building where Georges father lives. Matty is rich, well-meaning and fun, but is also immature and insensitive, and continues to have casual affairs with other women.George is indicted and could face prison time. Annie is so loyal that she tries to give him inside information in advance, but he urges her not to lose her own job. Matty tries to do better in Lisas eyes, promising to consider seeing fewer women on the side. He inadvertently offends her, so Lisa moves out and spends a pleasant, tipsy evening at Georges modest new apartment. Georges father then drops one last bombshell on his son: It was he who committed the illegal act for which George is being charged. Due to a previous conviction, Charles would spend at least 25 years — basically, the rest of his life — in prison, whereas George would only do three years at most.On the night Annies baby is born and her boyfriend proposes, Lisa begins to reconsider her previous reluctance to settle down. George is clearly smitten with her, but Matty pleads for another chance and she accepts. George makes a proposition to his father: He will take one more shot at persuading Lisa to be with him; If she will, Charles must go to jail, and if she wont, George will take the rap for his dad. At a birthday party that Matty throws for her, George confesses his feelings for Lisa and  goes outside to give her time to think it over, Charles looking on from above. Finally, Lisa says goodbye to Matty and joins George outside.

316,317,How to Train Your Dragon,2010,/wiki/How_to_Train_Your_Dragon_(film),"On Berk, a Viking village located on a remote island from which dragons periodically steal livestock, Hiccup, the awkward fifteen-year-old son of the village chieftain, Stoick the Vast, works as a blacksmiths apprentice. As he is too small and weak to fight the dragons, he instead fashions mechanical devices under his apprenticeship with Gobber, the senior blacksmith, though his inventions often malfunction or backfire. During one attack, Hiccup shoots down a Night Fury, an extremely rare and dangerous dragon, with a bola launcher of his, but when no one believes him he goes off to look for it on his own. He later finds it in the forest trapped in his bolas, but finding that he cannot bring himself to kill the dragon, he instead sets it free.Stoick assembles a fleet to find the dragons nest, entering Hiccup in a dragon-killing class taught by Gobber. Hiccup returns to the forest to find the Night Fury still there; he realizes the dragon is unable to fly properly because of its crippled tail fin. Hiccup befriends the dragon, gradually taming it and giving it the name Toothless due to its retractable teeth. Feeling guilty for crippling Toothless, Hiccup eventually makes a harness and prosthetic fin that allows him to guide the dragon in flight.By observing Toothlesss behavior, Hiccup becomes increasingly proficient in subduing the captive dragons during training nonviolently, earning him the admiration of his peers but causing Astrid, a tough Viking girl on whom Hiccup has a crush, to become increasingly suspicious of his behavior. Meanwhile, Stoicks fleet arrives home unsuccessful, though he is cheered by Hiccups unexpected success in dragon training. Astrid eventually discovers that he is training Toothless.

317,318,How to Train Your Dragon,2014,/wiki/How_to_Train_Your_Dragon_(film),"On Berk, a Viking village located on a remote island from which dragons periodically steal livestock, Hiccup, the awkward fifteen-year-old son of the village chieftain, Stoick the Vast, works as a blacksmiths apprentice. As he is too small and weak to fight the dragons, he instead fashions mechanical devices under his apprenticeship with Gobber, the senior blacksmith, though his inventions often malfunction or backfire. During one attack, Hiccup shoots down a Night Fury, an extremely rare and dangerous dragon, with a bola launcher of his, but when no one believes him he goes off to look for it on his own. He later finds it in the forest trapped in his bolas, but finding that he cannot bring himself to kill the dragon, he instead sets it free.Stoick assembles a fleet to find the dragons nest, entering Hiccup in a dragon-killing class taught by Gobber. Hiccup returns to the forest to find the Night Fury still there; he realizes the dragon is unable to fly properly because of its crippled tail fin. Hiccup befriends the dragon, gradually taming it and giving it the name Toothless due to its retractable teeth. Feeling guilty for crippling Toothless, Hiccup eventually makes a harness and prosthetic fin that allows him to guide the dragon in flight.By observing Toothlesss behavior, Hiccup becomes increasingly proficient in subduing the captive dragons during training nonviolently, earning him the admiration of his peers but causing Astrid, a tough Viking girl on whom Hiccup has a crush, to become increasingly suspicious of his behavior. Meanwhile, Stoicks fleet arrives home unsuccessful, though he is cheered by Hiccups unexpected success in dragon training. Astrid eventually discovers that he is training Toothless. Hiccup takes her for a flight to demonstrate his relationship with the dragon before she can tell the village. Toothless unexpectedly takes the pair to the dragons nest where they discover a gargantuan dragon named the Red Death, which eats the smaller dragons unless they bring it stolen livestock; the pair realize that the dragons have been attacking Berk under its control as opposed to their own free will.Back at the village, Hiccup, having won dragon training, is given the task of killing a captive Monstrous Nightmare dragon; he, instead, subdues it in front of his father and village instead of killing it in an attempt to prove that the dragons are harmless.

318,319,How to Train Your Dragon 2,2014,/wiki/How_to_Train_Your_Dragon_2,"Five years after the Viking village of Berk and the dragons made peace, they now live together in harmony. Hiccup goes on adventures with his dragon, Toothless, as they discover and map unexplored lands. Now 20 years old, he is being pressed by his father, Stoick the Vast, to succeed him as chieftain, although Hiccup remains unsure if he is ready for this responsibility.While investigating a burnt forest, Hiccup and Astrid discover the remains of a fort encased in ice and meet a group of dragon trappers led by Eret, who blames them for his forts destruction and attempts to capture their dragons for an insane conqueror named Drago Bludvist. The two dragon riders escape and return to Berk to warn Stoick about the dragon army that Drago is amassing. Stoick orders the villagers to fortify the island and prepare for battle. Hiccup, however, refuses to believe that war is inevitable. After Stoick interrupts Hiccups plan to get Eret to take him to Drago, Stoick explains that he once met Drago at a gathering of chiefs, where Drago, mocked after offering the chiefs his service in return for their servitude, murdered them all using armored dragons, with Stoick as the only survivor. Undeterred, Hiccup flies off with Toothless in search of Drago to try to reason with him.They run into a dragon rider named Valka, who is revealed to be Hiccups long-lost mother. She explains that she, like her son, could not bring herself to kill dragons. After being carried off during a dragon raid, she spent 20 years rescuing dragons from Dragos traps and bringing them to an island nest created out of ice by a gigantic Alpha dragon called a ""Bewilderbeast"", which is able to control smaller dragons. Stoick tracks Hiccup to the nest, where he discovers that his wife is still alive. Meanwhile, Astrid and the other riders kidnap Eret to find Drago, but Drago captures them and learns of Berks dragons.Drago and his armada lay siege to the nest, where he reveals that he has his own Bewilderbeast to challenge the Alpha. A battle ensues between the two colossal dragons, which ends with Dragos Bewilderbeast killing its opponent and becoming the new Alpha. Dragos Bewilderbeast then seizes control of all the adult dragons, which hypnotically obey. Hiccup tries to persuade Drago to end the violence, but Drago orders him killed. Toothless, under the Bewilderbeasts influence, approaches Hiccup and launches a plasma bolt towards him, but Stoick pushes Hiccup out of the way and is hit instead, dying as a result. The Bewilderbeast momentarily relinquishes control of Toothless, but Hiccup drives him away in a fit of despair. Drago maroons Hiccup and the others on the island and rides Toothless, again under the control of the Bewilderbeast, to lead his army to conquer Berk. Stoick is given a Viking funeral and Hiccup, now having lost both his father and dragon, is unsure what to do. Valka encourages him by telling him that he alone can unite humans and dragons, and inspired by her words and his fathers, Hiccup decides to return to Berk to stop Drago.The dragon riders fly baby dragons back to Berk, as they are immune to the Bewilderbeasts control. They find that Drago has already attacked the village and taken control of its dragons. Hiccup confronts Drago and a brainwashed Toothless while the other riders work to distract the Bewilderbeast. Hiccup succeeds in freeing Toothless from the Bewilderbeasts control, much to Dragos surprise. Hiccup and Toothless briefly separate Drago from the Bewilderbeast and confront Drago on the ground, but the Bewilderbeast attacks them, encasing them in ice. However, Toothless blasts away the ice, revealing that both Hiccup and he are unharmed. He then challenges the Bewilderbeast, shooting it in the face repeatedly, which breaks its control over the other dragons, who side with Toothless as the new Alpha dragon. All the dragons repeatedly fire at the Bewilderbeast until Toothless fires a final massive blast, breaking its left tusk. Defeated, the Bewilderbeast retreats under the sea with Drago on its back. The Vikings and dragons celebrate their victory and Hiccup is made chieftain of Berk.Afterwards, Berk undergoes repairs while feeling secure knowing that its dragons can defend it.",145000000,"[{""id"": 14, ""name"": ""Fantasy""}, {""id"": 28, ""name"": ""Action""}, {""id"": 12, ""name"": ""Adventure""}, {""id"": 16, ""name"": ""Animation""}, {""id"": 35, ""name"": ""Comedy""}, {""id"": 10751, ""name"": ""Family""}]",http://www.howtotrainyourdragon.com/,82702,"[{""id"": 494, ""name"": ""father son relationship""}, {""id"": 1157, ""name"": ""wife husband relationship""}, {""id"": 2858, ""name"": ""sacrifice""}, {""id"": 5895, ""name"": ""viking""}, {""id"": 9663, ""name"": ""sequel""}, {""id"": 10084, ""name"": ""rescue""}, {""id"": 12554, ""name"": ""dragon""}, {""id"": 157499, ""name"": ""mother son relationship""}, {""id"": 175421, ""name"": ""death of husband""}, {""id"": 192913, ""name"": ""warrior""}, {""id"": 209714, ""name"": ""3d""}]",en,"The thrilling second chapter of the epic How To Train Your Dragon trilogy brings back the fantastical world of Hiccup and Toothless five years later.

319,320,Hugo,2011,/wiki/Hugo_(film),"In 1931, 12-year-old Hugo Cabret (Asa Butterfield) lives in Paris with his father (Jude Law), a kind, widowed clockmaker who also works part-time at a museum. One day, his father finds a broken automaton - a mechanical man designed to write with a pen - at the museum. He and Hugo try to repair it, with Hugos father documenting the automaton in a notebook. When his father is killed by a fire at the museum, Hugo is forced to live with his resentful, alcoholic uncle Claude (Ray Winstone), and made to learn how to maintain the clocks at the railway station of Gare Montparnasse. When Claude goes missing for several days, Hugo continues to maintain the clocks, fearing that he would be sent away as an orphan by the vindictive Station Inspector Gustave Dasté (Sacha Baron Cohen) if Claudes absence is discovered. Hugo attempts to repair the automaton with stolen parts, believing it contains a message from his father, but the machine still requires a heart-shaped key that his father could not find.Hugo is caught when stealing from the toy store owner Georges (Ben Kingsley), who looks through his fathers notebook and threatens to destroy it. Hugo encounters Georges goddaughter Isabelle (Chloë Grace Moretz), who offers to help get the notebook back. Hugo learns Georges has forbidden Isabelle from going to the cinema, and introduces the medium to her as his father had done for him. As their friendship grows, he shows her the automaton, and is astonished when Isabelle inadvertently reveals she wears the key as a necklace given to her by Georges. When started, the machine draws out a scene that Hugo recognizes from his fathers description of the film A Trip to the Moon. Isabelle identifies the signature, that of a ""Georges Méliès"", as her godfather. She sneaks Hugo into her home, where they find a hidden cache of more imaginative drawings of Méliès, but are caught by Georges, who banishes Hugo from his home.Hugo and Isabelle go to the Film Academy Library and find a book about the history of cinema that praises Méliès contributions. They meet the books author, René Tabard (Michael Stuhlbarg), a film expert who is surprised to hear that Méliès might still be alive, as he had disappeared after World War I along with nearly all copies of his films. Excited at the chance to meet him, René agrees to meet Isabelle and Hugo at Georges home to show his copy of A Trip to the Moon, hoping it will invigorate Georges.The next day, Hugo discovers that the key has somehow found its way onto the railway tracks in the station. As he drops onto the track to retrieve it, he is suddenly hit by and killed by an uncontrollable train that eventually smashes through the walls of the station. Hugo wakes up to discover that the harrowing events were just a nightmare. After noticing that a pocket watch hanging from the rafters of his home is missing, Hugo can still hear an ominous ticking emanating from him. He then discovers hes been turned into the automaton, only for him to wake up again to discover that this was yet another nightmare, possibly and disturbingly symbolising Hugo’s belief of all beings having a sole purpose in life.On the scheduled night, Georges wife Jeanne (Helen McCrory) tries to turn them away, but René compliments Jeanne as Jeanne dAlcy, an actress in many of Méliès films, and she allows them to continue. As the film plays, Georges wakes up at the sight, and Jeanne finally convinces him to cherish his accomplishments rather than regret his lost dream. Georges recounts that as a stage magician, he had been fascinated by motion pictures, and used the medium to create imaginative works through his Star Film Company, but was forced into bankruptcy following the war, closing his studio and selling his films to be turned into raw materials. He laments that even an automaton he made that he donated to a museum was lost. Hugo recognizes this is the same automaton he has, and races to the station to retrieve it. He is caught by Gustave, who has learned that Claudes body was found some time ago, and threatens to take Hugo to the orphanage. Hugo runs from him, but drops the automaton on the tracks, he is almost run over by a train like his dream, but Gustave saves him and the automaton. Georges arrives and tells Gustave that he will now see to Hugo, adopting him as his son.Some time later, Georges is named a professor at the Film Academy, and is paid tribute through a showcase of his films recovered by René. Hugo joins in with his new family as they celebrate at the apartment, where the guests include a mellower Gustave. He has a new leg brace, and is clearly in love with Lisette (Emily Mortimer), a flower seller at the station.

In a fit of rage, the creature kills Victors wife Elizabeth and Victor chases it to the Arctic to get revenge, but succumbs to the weather. The creature buries his creator in the Frankenstein family cemetery and is then attacked by demons before being rescued by the gargoyles Ophir and Keziah, who bring it before the gargoyle queen Leonore and their commander Gideon. Leonore explains that they were created by the Archangel Michael to battle demons on Earth and protect humanity. They name the creature ""Adam"" and invite him to join them, but he declines and departs after being given heavy, baton-like weapons to protect himself, as more demons will come after him. The weapons allow him to ""descend"" demons (destroying their bodies and trapping their souls in Hell) as they have the symbol of the Gargoyle Order carved on them.Throughout the centuries, Adam fends off the demons that pursue him. During a modern-day confrontation at a nightclub, a human police officer is killed.

Wessex has employed scientists Terra Wade and Carl Avery to conduct experiments with reanimated corpses, and sends a group of demons led by his most formidable warrior, Zuriel, to attack the gargoyles cathedral and capture Adam so he can unlock the secret to giving life.Before Leonore can punish Adam for the police officers death, the cathedral is attacked and Adam convinces Ophir to release him. In the ensuing battle, a number of gargoyles, including Ophir and Keziah, are ""ascended"" (returned to and trapped in Heaven) while Leonore is captured and brought to an abandoned theater. Gideon is instructed to bring Adam as a trade for Leonore; Adam interrogates a demon and gains the same information. Adam having escaped, Gideon descends into the vaults and takes Victor Frankensteins journal, which was taken off of Adams body the night they found him. He exchanges the journal for Leonore, as it contains the secrets of the experiment. Once Gideon departs with Leonore, Adam attempts to recover the journal, but is prevented from doing so as several demons attack. Descending them, Adam then follows Zuriel to the Wessex Institute, where he learns that Naberius plans to recreate Frankensteins experiment and use thousands of reanimated corpses as hosts for souls of the descended demons. The demons will be able to return from Hell if they have soulless bodies to possess. Adam retrieves the journal and escapes, and later confronts Terra before they are attacked by Zuriel. Adam manages to ""descend"" Zuriel.Adam warns the remaining gargoyles of Naberius plan, agreeing to give them the journal if they get him and Terra to safety. Leonore agrees, but sends Gideon to kill him and retrieve the journal. After a violent fight, Adam is forced to ""ascend"" Gideon and then decides to burn Frankensteins journal and destroy its secrets before the gargoyles come after him. Adam evades them, leading them to the Wessex Institute where they join battle with Naberius demons, descending Dekar early in the fight. While the battle progresses, Adam ventures into the Institute to rescue Terra, who had been kidnapped by Naberius to put the next stage of his plan into process after he killed Avery. Naberius takes his true demonic form and activates the machine. Naberius overpowers Adam and tries to have one of the demon spirits possess him, but Adam proves immune as he has grown his own soul. As the gargoyles attempt to stop the reanimated bodies, Adam carves the symbol of the Gargoyle Order on Naberius, sanctifying his very body and utterly destroying it, descending Naberius alongside all the other demons in his army, and causing the entire building to collapse.Recognizing Adams bravery, Leonore rescues him and Terra and forgives Adam for Gideons death. Adam retrieves his weapons. After bidding farewell to Terra, Adam departs to begin an immortal quest to protect the humans of the world and hunt demons for selfless reasons, the attitude that had earned him his soul in the first place.

Ellie tries to support her daughter, but Manny becomes exceedingly over-protective. Meanwhile, Sids family returns, but only long enough to drop off the elderly Granny before abandoning them both. Shortly after, a sudden continental break-up separates Manny from The Herd. Trapped on a moving chunk of ice with Sid, Granny, and Diego, Manny has no choice but to ride out the current. Meanwhile, a giant land shift encroaches on Ellie, Peaches, and those remaining on land, causing them to make their way towards a land bridge.Meanwhile, Scrat, in a subplot, finds an acorn that has a treasure map on it that directs him towards an island. After violent weather pushes them further away from land, Mannys group is captured by a band of pirates sailing on a floating iceberg led by a Gigantopithecus, Captain Gutt, who attempts to press them into his crew. When they refuse, Gutt tries to execute them, leading to their escape, which inadvertently cause the ship and food supplies to sink. Gutts first mate, a female sabretooth named Shira, joins them after she is left for dead.The Herd washes ashore on Switchback Cove, which gives a current back to their home. Manny coordinates a plan using a group of hyrax to steal a new iceberg ship that Gutt is planning to use, and they are able to escape using the ship. Just before that, Diego, who has fallen in love with Shira, tries to convince her to leave the pirates and join The Herd so she can have a better life, but Shira, while initially accepting, instead stays behind and slows Gutt down so The Herd can escape. Gutt then forms another ship and plans to seek revenge on Manny.After narrowly escaping a pack of sirens, Manny, Sid, Diego, and Granny return home only to find the land bridge destroyed and that Gutt has beaten them and taken Ellie, Peaches, and the rest of The Herd hostage. A fight ensues, as Grannys pet whale, Precious, arrives and fends off Gutts crew. Manny defeats Gutt in a final duel on an ice floe and reunites with his family and friends. Gutt subsequently encounters a siren that assumes the shape of a female Gigantopithecus, and is eaten alive. With their home destroyed by the land shift, Precious takes the entire Herd (including Shira, who becomes a couple with Diego) to a lush island where the hyraxes from earlier have already started rebuilding their civilization.In the films epilogue, Scrat discovers the island on the map, known as Scratlantis (a parody of Atlantis), but his uncontrollable urge to hunt acorns in the acorn-rich city inadvertently causes the entire island to sink when he unplugs an acorn drain holder; Scrat is then ejected into a newly created desert landscape, through which he screams as his tears boil from the heat.",95000000,"[{""id"": 16, ""name"": ""Animation""}, {""id"": 35, ""name"": ""Comedy""}, {""id"": 12, ""name"": ""Adventure""}, {""id"": 10751, ""name"": ""Family""}]",http://www.iceagemovies.com/films/ice-age-continental-drift,57800,"[{""id"": 183413, ""name"": ""blue footed booby""}, {""id"": 183414, ""name"": ""prehistoric times""}, {""id"": 183415, ""name"": ""melting ice""}, {""id"": 183418, ""name"": ""badger""}, {""id"": 183421, ""name"": ""elephant seal""}, {""id"": 183422, ""name"": ""floating ice""}, {""id"": 183425, ""name"": ""land bridge""}, {""id"": 193193, ""name"": ""era""}, {""id"": 193194, ""name"": ""glaciale""}, {""id"": 193196, ""name"": ""deriva""}]",en,"Manny, Diego, and Sid embark upon another adventure after their continent is set adrift.

323,324,Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs,2012,/wiki/Ice_Age:_Dawn_of_the_Dinosaurs,"Ellie and Manny, the two woolly mammoths, are expecting their first child, and Manny struggles to make life perfect and safe for the family. At the same time, Diego the saber-toothed cat finds himself unable to catch a cocky gazelle he has been stalking and decides to leave The Herd, believing that he is losing his predatory nature as a tiger. Sid the ground sloth begins to wish for a family of his own and takes three apparently abandoned eggs that he finds in an icy underground cavern and calls them Egbert, Shelly, and Yoko. Manny tells him to put them back, but Sid ignores Manny and looks after the eggs, which hatch into baby Tyrannosaurus Rex the next morning.Although Sid tries his best to raise the three dinosaurs, their rambunctious behavior scares away all the younger animals and ruins a playground Manny built for his child. Not long after, a female Tyrannosaurus Rex, whose eggs Sid stole, soon returns and carries both Sid and her young underground, with Diego in pursuit. Manny, Ellie, Crash and Eddie the opossums follow as well and discover that the icy cavern leads to a vast subterranean jungle populated by dinosaurs thought to be extinct. Here, an angry Ankylosaurus threatens The Herd despite Diegos efforts to fend it off; they are saved from a further crowd of angry reptiles by a deranged one-eyed weasel named Buck.Buck has been living in this jungle for quite some time and is fighting Rudy, a huge albino Baryonyx, intending to avenge the eye he lost to it when he was young with a knife he carved from one of Rudys teeth. He agrees to lead The Herd through the jungles perils to Lava Falls, where the dinosaur has taken Sid and her babies. In the meantime, Sid and the mother dinosaur try to outdo each other in feeding the offspring; he loses this contest, but is reluctantly welcomed into the family regardless. The next day, however, Sid is separated from the family and attacked by Rudy. Sid is knocked onto a loose rock slab that is floating on a river of lava and about to plummet over the falls.As The Herd moves toward Lava Falls, Ellie goes into labor and a Guanlong pack strikes, causing a rock slide that separates her from Manny and Diego. Manny doubles back to protect her and Diego fends off further attacks, while Buck takes Crash and Eddie ahead to rescue Sid. Just as he goes over the falls, the trio swoops in on a commandeered Harpactognathus only to be chased by a flock of Pterodactylus on the way and saves his life. Manny reaches Ellie just in time to hear the cry of a newborn baby girl. Ellie names her Peaches after the fruit. Sid is saddened at the fact that he never had a chance to say goodbye to ""his"" children as he returns to The Herd and learns of Peaches birth.Before they can leave the jungle, they are ambushed by Rudy, who begins to attack them at full force; working together Manny, Sid, Diego, and Buck manage to trap Rudy by ensnaring him in vines. However, he quickly breaks free and resumes his onslaught. The Herd is saved by the timely arrival of the mother dinosaur, who charges at Rudy and knocks him off a cliff. As she and her children wish Sid well, Buck, now without a purpose in life since Rudy is gone, decides to join The Herd and live on the surface. However, a distant roar tells him that Rudy is still alive; he changes his mind and sends The Herd home, blocking off the path to the underground jungle at the same time. Manny and Ellie welcome Peaches into their frozen world and admit that Sid did a good job looking after Mommas children. Diego decides to remain with The Herd, while Buck stays underground, happily battling it out with Rudy.",90000000,"[{""id"": 16, ""name"": ""Animation""}, {""id"": 35, ""name"": ""Comedy""}, {""id"": 10751, ""name"": ""Family""}, {""id"": 12, ""name"": ""Adventure""}]",http://www.iceagemovies.com/films/ice-age-dawn-of-the-dinosaurs,8355,"[{""id"": 2219, ""name"": ""ice age""}, {""id"": 3450, ""name"": ""bridge""}, {""id"": 6255, ""name"": ""insanity""}, {""id"": 10787, ""name"": ""jungle""}, {""id"": 12616, ""name"": ""dinosaur""}, {""id"": 17985, ""name"": ""birth""}, {""id"": 179431, ""name"": ""duringcreditsstinger""}, {""id"": 209714, ""name"": ""3d""}]",en,"Times are changing for Manny the moody mammoth, Sid the motor mouthed sloth and Diego the crafty saber-toothed tiger.

At work, after Sandy clashes with his obnoxious and bullying boss, Harold Cornish (Jon Favreau), he receives a phone call that reminds him he has an appointment at a salon in Florida. Confused, he puts it out of his mind when co-worker Daniel Casey (John Cho) suggests they and several others leave Cornishs company and start their own firm; Sandy agrees to join them.When paying for gas, Sandys credit card is declined, and the clerk cuts it up.  As the credit card company tells him that he has spent huge amounts of money in Florida, he is arrested for missing a court date there.  At the police station, Detective Reilly (Morris Chestnut) determines Diana has stolen Sandys identity.  The situation worsens when cops ask Daniel, now his boss, about Sandys possession of drugs.  Reilly says Sandys name was used to buy drugs from someone named Paolo (Jonathan Banks).  Even though its clear Sandy is not guilty Reilly states he cannot be formally cleared of suspicion until they have evidence of Dianas guilt as it still could technically be Sandy in the eyes of the law. Daniel states they may have to fire Sandy due these issues.When the cops say they can do nothing due to jurisdictional issues unless the identity thief is in Denver, Sandy offers to retrieve her and convince her to clear his name with his boss, despite his wife, Trishs (Amanda Peet) concerns.Sandy finds Diana at the salon in Florida, but when he confronts her, she steals his rental car.  Finding her address in her abandoned car, he investigates her house, which is full of merchandise and stolen credit cards.  The pair scuffle; before Sandy can handcuff her, criminals Marisol (Genesis Rodriguez) and Julian (T.I.) burst in, angry that Diana gave Paolo bad credit cards.  After Sandy and Diana escape, Sandy tells her about his plan to restore his reputation, and she agrees to help on condition that no police are involved, Sandy agrees but had plans to have police in the next room when she speaks to his boss. Meanwhile, a skiptracer (Robert Patrick) is dispatched to track down Diana for a substantial bounty.  Because their IDs are identical, flight is impossible, and they travel to Denver by car.After traveling through several states, the skiptracer catches up to the pair and captures Diana. A chase ensues; she knocks him unconscious, and Sandy rams his van off the road.  When Sandys rental car gets plowed and totaled by an oncoming semi, they take the skiptracers van, with him tied up in the back.  When it overheats, they continue on foot, Diana thanks Sandy for saving her and calls him a good friend, Sandy coldly says they are not friends. Hoping to reach a nearby service station they take a detour through a forest but end up lost and having to spend the night.  Sandy discards his pants when he finds a snake in them, and Diana accidentally knocks him unconscious when another bites his neck.  Sandy wakes at a bus station, and Diana says she carried him until she flagged down a truck.  As the next bus to Denver leaves in three days, Sandy uses money hidden in his socks to buy a $200 car from an auto wrecking yard.  Running low on funds for gas money, Diana offers to help, Sandy is at first reluctant but Diana asks if he does not know anyone who truly deserves it.  The pair then con an accounts processor at a branch of Sandys old firm and steal Cornishs identity to create new credit cards.  Meanwhile, Marisol shoots the skiptracer, and the criminals continue their pursuit of Sandy and Diana.In St. Louis, the two share dinner, and Diana admits she does not know her real name due to growing up as a foster child. The accounts processor enters with cops, who arrest Sandy and Diana. Diana uncuffs herself in the back of the police car, breaks the back windshield, and escapes with Sandy.

Sandy comes to her aid, but Diana revives and defensively strikes Sandy in the throat. Diana and Sandy eventually get home, where Diana has dinner with Sandys family and reconciles with them.The next morning, Sandy finds Diana gone and a note that apologizes for the trouble she caused.  Sandy prepares to quit his job, but Daniel shows him that Diana turned herself in.  Detective Reilly tells Sandy he is no longer part of the investigation, and Diana is taken away in cuffs.  Before she leaves, Sandy asks her why; Diana says she knew he would not turn her in, but it was the right thing to do.  A year later, Sandy celebrates another birthday, this time with his third child.  The family visits Diana in prison, and Sandy presents her with a birth certificate that reveals her name as Dawn Budgie.They both agree it is an awful name.  Diana hugs Sandy.

325,326,Immortals,2011,/wiki/Immortals_(2011_film),"Before the dawn of man and beast, Immortals waged war against each other in Heaven. The victors declared themselves gods while the vanquished were renamed the Titans and imprisoned beneath Mount Tartarus. The Epirus Bow, a weapon of immense power, was lost on Earth during the war.In 1228 BC, the mortal king Hyperion of Heraklion searches for the bow, intending to use it to release the Titans to get revenge on the gods for failing to save his family from disease. Hyperion captures the virgin oracle Phaedra, believing that she can use her visions to find the Epirus Bows resting place.In a small village nearby, the inhabitants prepare to flee to Mount Tartarus to avoid Hyperions army. One inhabitant named Theseus is a skilled warrior trained by his mentor, a mysterious old man. Theseus and his mother Aethra, are considered undesirables because Theseus was born from Aethra being raped, and they are forced to stay behind by Athenian soldiers including Lysander. Theseus is able to beat multiple opponents until the Athenian officer Helios intervenes and discharges Lysander from the army for his actions. Lysander travels to Hyperion, offering his service and the villages location. Hyperion accepts, but hammers Lysanders testicles for being a traitor so he can never father children. Hyperions forces attack Theseuss village, murdering the villagers and Aethra, and taking Theseus captive.The old man is revealed to be Zeus when he meets with his fellow gods Athena, Poseidon, Ares, Apollo, and Heracles. Zeus warns them not to interfere in mortal affairs as gods unless the Titans are released, and that they must have faith in mankind to defeat Hyperion.Theseus is enslaved alongside the thief Stavros. Phaedra, who is held captive nearby, sees a vision of Theseus. Phaedra organizes a revolt, using the chaos to escape with Theseus, Stavros, Dareios and the monk that had earlier cut off his own tongue so that torture wouldnt make him tell Hyperion who was the virgin oracle. Theseus decides to pursue Hyperion and attempts to capture a boat, but he and his allies are overwhelmed by Hyperions forces. Poseidon disobeys Zeus orders and dives from Olympus into the ocean, causing a tsunami that wipes out Hyperions men. Phaedra tells Theseus of her vision and together they believe that the shrouded body is his mother and they must return home to bury Aethra. Even though Theseus doesnt believe in the gods, his mother did and so must be properly buried.While laying Aethra to rest in the villages labyrinth, Theseus discovers the Epirus Bow embedded in nearby rock. He frees the Epirus Bow, but is attacked by Hyperions henchman the Minotaur. Theseus kills the Minotaur and uses the Bow to save his allies from being executed before collapsing from poisoned scratches inflicted by the Minotaur. Phaedra tends to Theseus and later falls in love with him. They make love to each other, stripping her of the visions she deemed a curse.The group returns to Phaedras temple while Hyperion and his forces are away at Mount Tartarus. At the temple, the monk followed by Stavros and Theseus are lured into an ambush and Theseus loses the Epirus Bow. Outnumbered by Hyperions men, Ares directly intervenes to save Theseus, and Athena provides the men with horses to reach Mount Tartarus. Zeus arrives and angrily kills Ares for disobeying his command. Zeus tells Theseus and his allies to let Ares death be a warning to both the gods and them that they will receive no more help from the gods, and he must justify the faith Zeus has in him alone. Before leaving with Athena, Zeus tells Theseus to prove him right. The lost Epirus Bow is brought to Hyperion.Theseus, Stavros, and Phaedra travel to Mount Tartarus. Theseus tries in vain to warn Hellenics King Cassander of Hyperions plans, but Cassander dismisses his talk of gods as myth, intending to negotiate peace with Hyperion. The following day, Hyperion uses the Bow to destroy Mount Tartarus seemingly indestructible gate.Theseus leads the Hellenic army to war against the Hyperion forces, killing Lysander. Hyperion ignores the battle, storms through to Mount Tartarus, and kills Helios and Cassander, using the Epirus Bow to breach the mountain and free the Titans before Stavros and Theseus can stop him. The force of the release knocks the mortals down. Knocked into the vault and unable to escape, Stavros retrieves the Epirus Bow and kills a Titan to buy Theseus time to get away, but is killed by the other Titans. Zeus, Poseidon, Athena, Heracles, and Apollo arrive and battle the Titans while Theseus fights Hyperion. Zeus destroys the Epirus Bow, and the gods prove more than a match for the Titans, but they are overwhelmed by sheer numbers, with all but Zeus and Poseidon being killed. Theseus kills Hyperion while Zeus collapses Mount Tartarus on the Titans. As the mountain is collapsing, Zeus picks up Athenas body and ascends to Olympus along with a badly wounded Poseidon. The collapsing mountain wipes out all of Hyperions men. The mortally wounded Theseus is also transported to Olympus for his sacrifice and given a place among the gods.Several years later, Theseus story has become legend, and Phaedra is raising Theseus son Acamas, a gift from the gods. Acamas, an oracle like his mother was, is met by Zeus in his old man persona, who informs the child that in the future, he too will one day fight against evil and that he mustnt fear his visions. Acamas sees a vision of the sky filled with thousands of gods and Titans fighting (including Zeus and a fully healed Poseidon) with Theseus leading the charge.",75000000,"[{""id"": 14, ""name"": ""Fantasy""}, {""id"": 28, ""name"": ""Action""}, {""id"": 18, ""name"": ""Drama""}]",http://www.immortalsmovie.com/splash/,37958,"[{""id"": 351, ""name"": ""poison""}, {""id"": 6092, ""name"": ""army""}, {""id"": 8985, ""name"": ""zeus""}, {""id"": 14667, ""name"": ""poseidon""}, {""id"": 18096, ""name"": ""spear""}]",en,"Theseus is a mortal man chosen by Zeus to lead the fight against the ruthless King Hyperion, who is on a rampage across Greece to obtain a weapon that can destroy humanity.",37.917002,"[{""name"": ""Virgin Produced"", ""id"": 8852}, {""name"": ""Mark Canton Productions"", ""id"": 11761}]","[{""iso_3166_1"": ""US"", ""name"": ""United States of America""}]",11/10/2011,226904017,110,"[{""iso_639_1"": ""el"", ""name"": ""\u03b5\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac""}, {""iso_639_1"": ""en"", ""name"": ""English""}]",Released,The Gods need a hero.,Immortals,5.7,880,0.159614623,0.5,0.5,0.5,0,0,-0.340385377,0.113461792,3.025386893
326,327,In the Heart of the Sea,2015,/wiki/In_the_Heart_of_the_Sea_(film),"In 1850, author Herman Melville visits innkeeper Thomas Nickerson, the last survivor of the sinking of the whaleship Essex, offering money in return for his story. Nickerson initially refuses, but then finally agrees when his wife intervenes.The story turns to 1820: a whaling company in Nantucket has refitted the Essex to participate in the lucrative whale oil trade, and 14-year-old Nickerson signs on as a cabin boy. The owners hire veteran whaler Owen Chase as first mate, though he is disappointed not to receive a captains commission. The captain is George Pollard, an inexperienced mariner from an established whaling family who envies Chases skill and popularity. Chase and Pollard clash, leading Pollard to sail into a storm against Chases advice. The two agree to put their differences aside, rather than risking their reputations by returning to port without profit, and soon, the crew kills their first bull sperm whale.Three months pass with no further successes, and Pollard realizes that the Atlantic Ocean holds no sighting of whales. The Essex sails past Cape Horn to the Pacific, hoping for better luck in catching one. In Atacames, Ecuador, the officers meet a Spanish captain who tells them his crew found the bountiful ""Offshore Grounds"" 2,000 miles to the west, but claims that a vengeful ""white whale"" destroyed his ship, killing six of his men. Denying the story as a myth, Pollard and Chase lead the expedition west. They find the undisturbed grounds, but when they launch the whaling boats, the white whale, a massive albino bull sperm whale attacks, damaging the boats and turning on the ship.Chase harpoons it from the Essexs deck, but the whale staves the ship in half, killing two men. The crew abandons the sinking Essex in the three intact whaling boats, and must sail hundreds of miles to shore with very limited supplies. The whale follows and attacks again, but they escape to the tiny Henderson Island. While gathering food, Chase discovers the corpses of earlier castaways, and concludes that the crew will soon die on the island before another ship passes by. Four men decide to stay, while the rest set sail again on the boats with hopes to find land. Soon after, one of the men dies, and the remaining crew reluctantly decide to cannibalize him.The older Nickerson is overcome by emotion and stops his story; however, when his wife comforts him, he feels encouraged enough to finish. Back in the 1820s, the three boats separate and one is lost. The other two further resort to cannibalism to survive, with Pollards cousin Henry Coffin sacrificing himself.The whale returns, and Chase gets into position for a final attack. The whale breaches for a moment, allowing Chase to observe a portion of his previously thrown harpoon still embedded in the whales skull. Chase hesitates, and stares into the whales left eye. He decides not to attack. Following this encounter, the whale swims away peacefully, and is never seen again.A passing ship rescues Pollards boat, but Chases boat continues to drift with no food or water. Finally, with the survivors on the verge of death, they reach land. The survivors return to Nantucket and finally reunite with their distraught families. The ships owners ask Pollard and Chase to cover up the story to protect the industry, but after Chase refuses to go along, Pollard reveals the truth in the inquiry.Nickerson relates that a ship was sent to Henderson Island to rescue the surviving men there, Chase continued sailing the seas and became a merchant captain, and Pollard led another expedition to kill the whale, but the ship wrecked and he was forced to retire.

When the clock reaches zero, that person ""times out"", or dies. Time has thus become the universal currency, transferred between people or within ""time capsules"". Two major areas called Time Zones exist within Ohio: Dayton, a poor manufacturing area where people rarely have more than 24 hours on their watch, and Greenwich, which is called New Greenwich, where people have enough time to essentially be immortal.Will Salas is a Dayton factory worker, who rescues a drunken man named Henry Hamilton from a robbery by a time-robbing thugs led by Fortis. Hamilton reveals that the people of New Greenwich hoard most of the time to live forever, while constantly increasing costs keeps poorer people dying. The next morning, Hamilton transfers 116 years of his time to Will, and times out. Raymond Leon, leader of the police-like Timekeepers erroneously assumes that Will played a part in Hamiltons death.Will visits his friend Borel, who warns him that having so much time will get him killed. Will gives Borel ten years and goes to meet his mother to leave for New Greenwich together. She uses all but 90 minutes of her time to pay off and dies in Wills arms before he can lend her time.In New Greenwich, Will visits a casino and meets time-loaning businessman Philippe Weis and his daughter Sylvia. While playing poker, Will comes dangerously close to timing out but eventually wins more than a millennium in a flawless gamble. Sylvia invites him to a party, and Will buys a new sports car and drives himself to the party. Indoors, Will is arrested by the Timekeepers.All but two hours of his time are confiscated. Will takes Sylvia as a hostage and returns to Dayton. They are ambushed by Fortis gang, and are left with 30 minutes each. Will attempts to get some time back from Borel, but he has drunk himself to death. Will calls Weis to demand a 1,000-year ransom to be paid into the time-mission for the desperate. When Weis refuses, Will releases Sylvia anyway. They are ambushed by Raymond, whom Sylvia shoots in the arm to protect Will. They steal his car, and Will gives Raymond enough time to survive.Will and Sylvia rob Weis time banks, giving the extra time capsules to the needy. However, the pair soon realize that they cannot significantly change anything, as New Greenwich simply raises prices on Daytoners. So they rob Weis vault of a one-million-year capsule. Raymond chases them back to Dayton but is too late to stop them from distributing the stolen time. He intends to stop other Daytoners escaping, but times out. TV reports show factories in Dayton shutting down as everyone has enough time and abandons their jobs to go to New Greenwich.

328,329,Inception,2010,/wiki/Inception,"Dominick ""Dom"" Cobb and Arthur are ""extractors"", who perform corporate espionage using an experimental military technology to infiltrate the subconscious of their targets and extract valuable information through a shared dream world. Their latest target, Japanese businessman Saito, reveals that he arranged their mission himself to test Cobb for a seemingly impossible job: planting an idea in a persons subconscious, or ""inception"". To break up the energy conglomerate of ailing competitor Maurice Fischer, Saito wants Cobb to convince Fischers son and heir, Robert, to dissolve his fathers company. In return, Saito promises to use his influence to clear Cobb of a murder charge, allowing Cobb to return home to his children. Cobb accepts the offer and assembles his team: Eames, a conman and identity forger; Yusuf, a chemist who concocts a powerful sedative for a stable ""dream within a dream"" strategy; and Ariadne, an architecture student tasked with designing the labyrinth of the dream landscapes, recruited with the help of Cobbs father-in-law, Professor Stephen Miles. While dream-sharing with Cobb, Ariadne learns his subconscious houses an invasive projection of his late wife Mal.When the elder Fischer dies in Sydney, Robert Fischer accompanies the body on a ten-hour flight back to Los Angeles, which the team (including Saito, who wants to verify their success) uses as an opportunity to sedate and take Fischer into a shared dream. At each dream level, the person generating the dream stays behind to set up a ""kick"" that will be used to awaken the other sleeping team members from the deeper dream level; to be successful, these kicks must occur simultaneously at each dream level, a fact complicated due to the nature of time which flows much faster in each successive level. The first level is Yusufs dream of a rainy Los Angeles. The team abducts Fischer, but they are attacked by armed projections from Fischers subconscious, which has been specifically trained to defend him against such intruders. The team takes Fischer and a wounded Saito to a warehouse, where Cobb reveals that while dying in the dream would normally wake Saito up, the powerful sedatives needed to stabilize the multi-level dream will instead send a dying dreamer into ""limbo"", a world of infinite subconscious from which escape is extremely difficult, if not impossible, and a dreamer risks forgetting they are in a dream. Despite these setbacks, the team continues with the mission.Eames impersonates Fischers godfather, Peter Browning, to suggest Fischer reconsider his fathers will. Yusuf drives the van as the other dreamers are sedated into the second level. In the second level, a hotel dreamed by Arthur, Cobb persuades Fischer that he has been kidnapped by Browning and Cobb is his subconscious protector. Cobb persuades him to go down another level to explore Brownings subconscious (in reality, it is a ruse to enter Fischers). The third level is a fortified hospital on a snowy mountain dreamed by Eames. The team has to infiltrate it and hold off the guards as Cobb takes Fischer into the equivalent of his subconscious. Yusuf, under pursuit by Fischers projections in the first level, deliberately drives off a bridge and initiates his kick too soon. This causes an avalanche in Eames level and removes the gravity of Arthurs level, forcing him to improvise a new kick synchronized with the van hitting the water. Mals projection emerges and kills Fischer; Cobb kills Mal, and Saito succumbs to his wounds. Cobb and Ariadne enter Limbo to rescue Fischer and Saito, while Eames sets up a kick by rigging the hotel with explosives.Cobb reveals to Ariadne that he and Mal went to Limbo while experimenting with the dream-sharing technology. Sedated for a few hours of real time, they spent fifty years in a dream constructing a world from their shared memories. When Mal refused to return to reality, Cobb used a rudimentary form of inception by reactivating her totem (an object dreamers use to distinguish dreams from reality) and reminding her subconscious that their world was not real. However, when she woke up, Mal still believed that she was dreaming. In an attempt to ""wake up"" for real, Mal committed suicide and framed Cobb for her death to force him to do the same. Facing a murder charge, Cobb fled the U.S., leaving his children in the care of Professor Miles.Through his confession, Cobb makes peace with his guilt over Mals death. Ariadne kills Mals projection and wakes Fischer up with a kick. Revived at the mountain fort, Fischer enters a safe room to discover and accept the planted idea: a projection of his dying father telling him to be his own man. While Cobb remains in Limbo to search for Saito, the other team members ride the synchronized kicks back to reality. Cobb eventually finds an aged Saito in Limbo and reminds him of their agreement. The dreamers all awake on the plane and Saito makes a phone call.Upon arrival at Los Angeles Airport, Cobb passes the U.S. immigration checkpoint and Professor Miles accompanies him to his home. Using his totem—a spinning top that spins indefinitely in a dream world but falls over in reality—Cobb conducts a test to prove that he is indeed in the real world, but he ignores its result and instead joins his children in the garden.",160000000,"[{""id"": 28, ""name"": ""Action""}, {""id"": 53, ""name"": ""Thriller""}, {""id"": 878, ""name"": ""Science Fiction""}, {""id"": 9648, ""name"": ""Mystery""}, {""id"": 12, ""name"": ""Adventure""}]",http://inceptionmovie.warnerbros.com/,27205,"[{""id"": 1014, ""name"": ""loss of lover""}, {""id"": 1566, ""name"": ""dream""}, {""id"": 1930, ""name"": ""kidnapping""}, {""id"": 2116, ""name"": ""sleep""}, {""id"": 2117, ""name"": ""subconsciousness""}, {""id"": 10051, ""name"": ""heist""}, {""id"": 11436, ""name"": ""redemption""}, {""id"": 160137, ""name"": ""female hero""}]",en,"Cobb, a skilled thief who commits corporate espionage by infiltrating the subconscious of his targets is offered a chance to regain his old life as payment for a task considered to be impossible: ""inception"", the implantation of another person's idea into a target's subconscious.",167.58371,"[{""name"": ""Legendary Pictures"", ""id"": 923}, {""name"": ""Warner Bros."", ""id"": 6194}, {""name"": ""Syncopy"", ""id"": 9996}]","[{""iso_3166_1"": ""GB"", ""name"": ""United Kingdom""}, {""iso_3166_1"": ""US"", ""name"": ""United States of America""}]",7/14/2010,825532764,148,"[{""iso_639_1"": ""en"", ""name"": ""English""}, {""iso_639_1"": ""ja"", ""name"": ""\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e""}, {""iso_639_1"": ""fr"", ""name"": ""Fran\u00e7ais""}]",Released,Your mind is the scene of the crime.,Inception,8.1,13752,0.784168243,0.5,0.907725573,0.882933915,0.024791658,-0.407725573,0.284168243,0.238895158,5.159579775
329,330,Independence Day: Resurgence,2016,/wiki/Independence_Day:_Resurgence,"Twenty years after the devastating alien invasion, the United Nations has set up the Earth Space Defense (ESD), a global defense and research program that reverse-engineers alien technology and serves as Earths early warning system against extraterrestrial threats. Civilization has been restored and relative peace among nations exists following the human races victory over the aliens attacks.As the twentieth anniversary of the invasion approaches, ESD Director David Levinson meets with warlord Dikembe Umbutu and Dr. Catherine Marceaux in the African state Republique Nationale dUmbutu. They travel to an intact alien city destroyer and discover that alien survivors sent a distress call to their home world before their defeat. It is revealed that former U.S. President Thomas Whitmore, Dr. Brackish Okun, and Umbutu are telepathically linked to the aliens, following personal encounters, and have visions of an unidentified spherical object.An unidentified spherical ship emerges from a wormhole near Earths Moon, and despite objections from Levinson, is destroyed on the orders of the United Nations Security Council. Defying orders, American pilots Jake Morrison and Charlie Miller then pick up Levinson, Marceaux, Umbutu, and U.S. federal controller Floyd Rosenberg on a space tug. They head for the wreckage in the Van de Graaff crater, where they recover a large container. An alien mothership suddenly appears, responding to the distress call, and proceeds to destroy much of the Earths planetary defenses before landing over the North Atlantic Ocean, where it starts to drill down toward the Earths molten core. Narrowly escaping death, those on board the space tug are able to avoid capture and return to Area 51.Whitmore, Levinson, and U.S. General Joshua Adams groups interrogate one of the aliens held in captivity at Area 51s prison facility from the war. They learn that the aliens exist in a hivemind and that one of their colossal Queens is commanding the invasion. Levinson hypothesizes that if they kill the supervising Queen, her forces will cease drilling and go dormant. An ESD aerial fleet, led by Captain Dylan Hiller, stages a counterattack, but they are caught in a trap within the mothership, leaving only a few survivors, including Dylan, Jake, Charlie, and fellow ESD lieutenant and Chinese pilot Rain Lao.In Area 51, Okun opens the rescued container and releases a giant white sphere of virtual intelligence. The sphere reveals that her mission is to evacuate survivors to a planet of refuge from worlds targeted by the aliens, whom she calls ""Harvesters"", and unite them in an attack on the Harvesters planet. In the mothership, all surviving ESD pilots manage to escape by hijacking enemy craft; Dylan, Jake, Charlie, and Rain navigate two Harvester fighters to pursue the Queens personal ship, which is heading to Area 51 to extract information from the sphere about the refugee planet.Knowing the Harvester Queen has become aware of the spheres location, the ESD hide her in an isolation chamber and use a decoy in Jakes space tug to lure the Harvester Queens ship into a trap. Whitmore volunteers to pilot the transport ship on a suicide mission, leading the Queens ship into a trap before detonating a bomb, thus sacrificing himself but destroying the enemy ship. However, the Harvester Queen survives by using an energy shield and a fight breaks out. Initially, the ESD soldiers weapons cannot penetrate the Queens shield, but after the Harvester Queen lowers her shield to fire her own weapon, a good shot by Whitmores daughter Patricia disables her shield. This allows Dylans party, which arrives just in time, to ultimately kill her before she can take the sphere.With the Queen dead, all the remaining alien fighters are rendered inactive, while the mothership stops drilling and retreats to space. Okun reveals that the sphere has asked humanity to lead her resistance and has offered them new technology in preparation for a potential counterattack on the Harvesters home world.",165000000,"[{""id"": 28, ""name"": ""Action""}, {""id"": 12, ""name"": ""Adventure""}, {""id"": 878, ""name"": ""Science Fiction""}]",http://www.warof1996.com,47933,"[{""id"": 12026, ""name"": ""alternate history""}, {""id"": 14909, ""name"": ""alien invasion""}]",en,"We always knew they were coming back.

331,332,Inside Out,2015,/wiki/Inside_Out_(2015_film),"Riley Andersen is born in Minnesota. Within her minds Headquarters, five personifications of her basic emotions — Joy, Sadness, Fear, Disgust, and Anger — come to life and influence her actions via a control console. As she grows up, her experiences become memories, stored in colored orbs, which are sent into long-term memory each night. Her five most important ""core memories"" (all happy ones) are housed in a hub; each powers an aspect of her personality which takes the form of floating islands. Joy acts as a de facto leader, and since she and the other emotions do not understand Sadness purpose, she tries to keep Sadness away from the console.At the age of 11, Riley and her parents move to San Francisco for her fathers new business. Riley has poor first experiences: the new house is cramped and old, the moving van with their belongings is misdirected, and her father is under stress from his business. When Sadness begins touching Rileys happy memories, turning them sad, Joy tries to guard them by isolating her. On Rileys first day at her new school, Sadness accidentally causes Riley to cry in front of her class, creating a sad core memory. Joy, panicking, tries to dispose of it, but accidentally knocks the other core memories loose during a struggle with Sadness, deactivating the personality islands. Joy, Sadness, and the core memories are sucked out of Headquarters and taken to the maze-like storage area of long-term memory.Anger, Fear, and Disgust try to maintain Rileys happiness in Joys absence with disastrous results, distancing her from her parents, friends, and hobbies. As a result, her personality islands gradually crumble and fall, one by one, into the ""Memory Dump"", an abyss where memories are forgotten. Finally, Anger inserts an idea into the console, prompting Riley to run away to Minnesota.While navigating through the long-term memory region, Joy and Sadness encounter Bing Bong, Rileys childhood imaginary friend, who suggests riding the train of thought back to Headquarters. En route to the train station, Bing Bong tearfully watches his rainbow wagon rocket being thrown into the memory dump along with other unused childish artifacts. The three eventually catch the train, but it halts when Riley falls asleep, then derails entirely when ""Honesty Island"" collapses due to Rileys theft of her mothers credit card. In desperation, Joy abandons Sadness and tries to ride a ""recall tube"" back to Headquarters, but the ground below the tube collapses, breaking it and plunging Joy and Bing Bong into the Memory Dump.At the bottom of the abyss, Joy begins to lose hope and breaks into tears, but then discovers a sad memory of an ice hockey game that turned happy when Rileys parents and friends comforted her. Joy finally realizes Sadnesss purpose: to induce empathy in others, prompting them to reach out to Riley when she is emotionally overwhelmed and needs help. Joy and Bing Bong try to use the wagon rocket to escape the Memory Dump. After several tries, Bing Bong, who is already fading away, jumps out to allow Joy to escape and is forgotten.Joy reunites with a despondent Sadness and takes them to Headquarters, only to discover that Angers idea has disabled the console, rendering Riley apathetic. To the surprise of the others, Joy hands control of the console to Sadness, who is able to extract the idea, reactivating the console and prompting Riley to return home. As Sadness re-installs the core memories, turning them sad, Riley arrives home to her parents and tearfully confesses that she misses Minnesota and her old life.

332,333,Inside Out,2015,/wiki/Inside_Out_(2015_film),"Riley Andersen is born in Minnesota. Within her minds Headquarters, five personifications of her basic emotions — Joy, Sadness, Fear, Disgust, and Anger — come to life and influence her actions via a control console. As she grows up, her experiences become memories, stored in colored orbs, which are sent into long-term memory each night. Her five most important ""core memories"" (all happy ones) are housed in a hub; each powers an aspect of her personality which takes the form of floating islands. Joy acts as a de facto leader, and since she and the other emotions do not understand Sadness purpose, she tries to keep Sadness away from the console.At the age of 11, Riley and her parents move to San Francisco for her fathers new business. Riley has poor first experiences: the new house is cramped and old, the moving van with their belongings is misdirected, and her father is under stress from his business. When Sadness begins touching Rileys happy memories, turning them sad, Joy tries to guard them by isolating her. On Rileys first day at her new school, Sadness accidentally causes Riley to cry in front of her class, creating a sad core memory. Joy, panicking, tries to dispose of it, but accidentally knocks the other core memories loose during a struggle with Sadness, deactivating the personality islands. Joy, Sadness, and the core memories are sucked out of Headquarters and taken to the maze-like storage area of long-term memory.Anger, Fear, and Disgust try to maintain Rileys happiness in Joys absence with disastrous results, distancing her from her parents, friends, and hobbies. As a result, her personality islands gradually crumble and fall, one by one, into the ""Memory Dump"", an abyss where memories are forgotten. Finally, Anger inserts an idea into the console, prompting Riley to run away to Minnesota.While navigating through the long-term memory region, Joy and Sadness encounter Bing Bong, Rileys childhood imaginary friend, who suggests riding the train of thought back to Headquarters. En route to the train station, Bing Bong tearfully watches his rainbow wagon rocket being thrown into the memory dump along with other unused childish artifacts. The three eventually catch the train, but it halts when Riley falls asleep, then derails entirely when ""Honesty Island"" collapses due to Rileys theft of her mothers credit card. In desperation, Joy abandons Sadness and tries to ride a ""recall tube"" back to Headquarters, but the ground below the tube collapses, breaking it and plunging Joy and Bing Bong into the Memory Dump.At the bottom of the abyss, Joy begins to lose hope and breaks into tears, but then discovers a sad memory of an ice hockey game that turned happy when Rileys parents and friends comforted her. Joy finally realizes Sadnesss purpose: to induce empathy in others, prompting them to reach out to Riley when she is emotionally overwhelmed and needs help. Joy and Bing Bong try to use the wagon rocket to escape the Memory Dump. After several tries, Bing Bong, who is already fading away, jumps out to allow Joy to escape and is forgotten.Joy reunites with a despondent Sadness and takes them to Headquarters, only to discover that Angers idea has disabled the console, rendering Riley apathetic. To the surprise of the others, Joy hands control of the console to Sadness, who is able to extract the idea, reactivating the console and prompting Riley to return home. As Sadness re-installs the core memories, turning them sad, Riley arrives home to her parents and tearfully confesses that she misses Minnesota and her old life. Her parents comfort her and admit they, too, miss Minnesota as much as she does. Joy and Sadness work the console together, creating a new amalgamated bitter-sweet core memory in Rileys Headquarters; a new island forms, representing Rileys acceptance of her new life in San Francisco.A year later at the age of 12, Riley has adapted to her new home, made new friends, and returned to her old hobbies while adopting a few new ones.

Soon after, paranormal activity begins to occur; Renai begins hearing voices over the baby monitor when no one is in Calis room, Foster says that Dalton sleepwalks at night, Renai sees a frightening figure of a man in Calis room, and the homes security alarm is repeatedly triggered for no reason.

Immediately after, Daltons room is ransacked by unseen forces.Lorraine calls demonologists Elise Reiner, Specs and Tucker.  Elise senses a presence in the house and upon entering Daltons room sees the same demonic, red-faced figure Lorraine saw.Elise explains that Dalton is not in a coma; he was born with the ability to travel mentally to the astral plane, and had been doing so in his sleep, believing his abilities to merely be dreams.  He has traveled too far and became lost in a purgatory realm called ""The Further"", a place inhabited by the tortured souls of the dead.

After investigating the house and encountering paranormal phenomena, Elise tells Lorraine that they must suppress Joshs astral projection abilities for his own safety.Twenty-five years later, Renai Lambert is under questioning about the death of Elise.  She is warned that if her husband Joshs fingerprints are found at the crime scene, he will be prosecuted for Elises murder.  The Lambert family relocate to Lorraines house as the investigation continues.  Renai and the others begin to experience strange, seemingly paranormal activity in the house.Specs and Tucker visit Elises house and discover a videotape of the 1986 investigation.  Upon reviewing it, they find someone standing behind Josh in the video.  The next morning, Dalton tells Renai that he has been having bad dreams involving a woman in a white dress; as well as hearing Josh talk to an unseen figure in the hallway.  Renai receives a call from the police stating that the fingerprints do not match Josh.  The woman in the white dress appears and attacks Renai.  Josh hears a voice urging him to kill his family.Lorraine visits Specs and Tucker and they show her the tape, enhanced to show an adult Josh as the figure standing behind the young Josh.  They contact Elises former colleague Carl, who attempts to contact Elises spirit.  They are told to find answers at an abandoned hospital where Lorraine used to work as a doctor.  Upon arriving, Lorraine recounts the story of a patient named Parker Crane who was admitted for trying to castrate himself.  Two days later, Lorraine saw Parker in an elevator.  When Lorraine asked a nurse why Parker was out of his bed, the nurse explained that he had jumped to his death from the roof the day before.Lorraine and the group go to the Crane family home where they find a secret room.  Inside they discover numerous corpses, a black wedding gown and newspaper clippings revealing Parker to be a killer referred to as ""The Bride in Black"" - who kidnapped and murdered young women while dressed as a woman himself.  Joshs body begins to slowly deteriorate and Renai realizes he is possessed.  Lorraine insists that they all get away from Josh.  Carl arrives to drug him, accompanied by Specs and Tucker, but Josh manages to subdue all three. Carl awakes in the spirit realm of ""The Further"", where he meets the spirit of the real Josh. Josh travels to his daughter Calis room in ""The Further"", where an evil spirit is approaching her.  He struggles with the spirit but is overpowered.  Elises spirit arrives and banishes the spirit from the house.  It is revealed that these actions are what triggered some of the mysterious events in the first film, as time moves non-chronologically in the Further.In the real world, Josh, who is possessed by Parker,  ambushes Lorraine and Renai, locking Lorraine in a closet.  Renai and the children escape to the basement.  Dalton voluntarily enters The Further to help his father.  In The Further, Josh, Carl, and Elise try to track Parker down by revisiting Josh in 1986, with the young Josh showing the adult Josh where to find him.  In Parkers house, the three witness Parkers mother, Michelle – the woman in the white dress – abusing him for acting like a male; and forcing him to dress and act like a girl.  Parker had killed his female victims at the behest of his mothers spirit.  Upon finding Michelle, she and Josh fight. Elise saves Josh and appears to destroy Michelles spirit, which stops the possessed Josh from murdering his family in the real world.  Parkers ghost disappears.  Carl and Josh escape, only to find Dalton, who leads them back to the living world, allowing Josh to finally regain control of his body.  The Lambert family is finally reunited, with Josh and Dalton allowing themselves to once again have their memories suppressed by Carl.Some time later, Specs and Tucker arrive at the house of a family whose daughter, Allison, is in an unexplained coma.

Tris overhears Marcus discussing with the Amity leader Johanna Reyes that the Abnegation leaders died to protect a secret. Erudite and the Dauntless traitors soon arrive to arrest any of the Divergent they can find, though Tris flees with Four, Caleb, and Susan Black towards a train that leads them to the factionless sector. There, they are greeted by Tobias mother, Evelyn Johnson-Eaton.She unsuccessfully persuades her son to sway the Dauntless into joining forces with the factionless against Erudite. While Caleb and Susan decide to move back to the Abnegation sector, Tris and Tobias head to the Candor headquarters, where the other Dauntless members now reside. The two are forced to take truth serums, in which Tobias confides his reasons for transferring to Dauntless, while Tris reveals her killing of Will in self-defense, which strains her relationship with her friend, Christina. That night, the Dauntless traitors, led by Eric, arrive and shoot simulation serums on their fellow Dauntless members while at the same throw smoke gas, which knocks all unconscious except for the Divergents — Tris, Uriah Pedrad, and several others. While Eric is executing some of the Divergents, Tris wounds him, giving time for the Dauntless members not breathing the gas, including Tobias, to capture him and force the other traitors to flee. Their safety is revealed to be guaranteed by an Erudite renegade and Wills sister, Cara.Tris, Tobias, Lynn, and Shauna spy on the discussion set upon by the Candor leader Jack Kang with Jeanine Matthewss representative and a Dauntless traitor, Max. During the meeting, Lynn shoots and kills Max, while Shauna is rendered paraplegic by a nerve serum. To prevent Jeanine from holding another prisoner exchange, Dauntless vote to execute Eric, which Tobias does with no hesitation, while to avoid a dependence on Candor, Dauntless leave for their headquarters and disable most of the security cameras inside. However, Tris is alerted by Christina that one undisarmed camera causes three Dauntless members: Marlene, Hector, and Kee, to become simulated into attempting to commit suicide unless a Divergent is handed over; out of the three, they are unable to save Marlene.To prevent more people from dying, Tris offers herself over to Erudite and is placed in a cell by Peter and, to her shock, Caleb, both of whom are now working with Jeanine. However, Tobias follows her and ends up becoming captured, although he states that he has managed to convince Dauntless to ally themselves with the factionless, with the upcoming insurgency scheduled several days afterward. After unsuccessful simulation tests, Jeanine orders for Tris execution, but Peter, in return for Tris rescue of him at the Amity sector, has swapped the serum for a paralytic serum beforehand and also frees Tobias, allowing the trio a chance to escape back to the Abnegation sector. There, Tris meets with Marcus, who tells him that Jeanine is withholding the information that Abnegation protected; should the factionless take hold of it, it would certainly be destroyed.Tris, Christina, and Marcus head for Amity to request Johannas help, who, alongside several others including Susans brother, Robert, choose to assist them despite Amitys resistance. They are additionally assisted by Cara and another Erudite renegade, Fernando, who act as navigators. This so-called ""Insurgents"" infiltrate the Erudite headquarters the following day, which sees the loss of Fernando, but they manage to access Jeanines laboratory. Inside, Tris faces simulations before confronting Jeanine, who is cornered by Tori Wu. Despite trying to convince Tori to let her go, Tori kills Jeanine, then brands Tris a traitor. The invasion of Erudite having ended, Tris learns about the casualties, including Lynn, the fact that the factionless have taken all the weapons so they can rule after Jeanines demise, and is subsequently handcuffed alongside Christina, Marcus, and the other Insurgents, though she is able to tell Tobias about the information, which he and Caleb share through the computers. The information is a video narrated by a woman named Edith Prior, who came from ""an organization fighting for peace"". Edith vaguely explains that the world had become corrupt, and it is for this reason that the city was sealed away from the rest of the world to allow the Divergent numbers to increase, after which Amity would open the fence forever and the population should re-enter the world.

338,339,Interstellar,2014,/wiki/Interstellar_(film),"In the mid-21st century, crop blights and dust storms threaten humanitys survival. Joseph Cooper, a widowed engineer and former NASA pilot, runs a farm with his father-in-law Donald, son Tom, and daughter Murph. Living in a post-truth society, Cooper is reprimanded for telling Murph that the Apollo missions did occur; he encourages her to carefully observe and record what she sees. They discover that strange dust patterns, which Murph first attributes to a ghost, result from gravity variations and translate into geographic coordinates. These lead them to a secret NASA facility headed by Coopers former supervisor, Professor John Brand, who explains that 48 years earlier a wormhole appeared near Saturn, opening a path to a distant galaxy with twelve potentially habitable planets located near a black hole named ""Gargantua"". Twelve volunteers had previously traveled through the wormhole to evaluate the planets, and astronauts Miller, Edmunds, and Mann reported positive results. Professor Brand explains he has conceived two plans to ensure humanitys survival. Plan A involves developing a gravitational propulsion theory to  propel a mass exodus on massive space habitats, while Plan B is a conventional launch of the Endurance spacecraft with 5,000 frozen human embryos to colonize a habitable planet. Cooper is recruited to pilot the Endurance. When Murph refuses to see him off, he leaves her his wristwatch to compare their relative time when he returns.The crew consists of Cooper, the robots TARS and CASE, and the scientists Dr. Amelia Brand (Professor Brands daughter), Dr. Romilly, and Dr. Doyle. After traversing the wormhole, Romilly studies the singularity while Cooper, Doyle and Amelia descend in one of four landing crafts to investigate Millers planet, an ocean world with 130% of Earths gravity. After landing in knee-high water and finding only wreckage from Millers expedition, a gigantic tidal wave kills Doyle and delays departure. Due to the proximity to the black hole, time is severely dilated; seven years pass by for each hour spent on the planet. As a result, 23 years have elapsed for Romilly on Endurance by the time they return.Edmunds planet has slightly better telemetry, but Mann is still broadcasting from his, so Cooper rules they use their remaining fuel to reach Manns planet. En route, they receive messages from Earth; Murph, now a scientist, has learned from Professor Brand on his deathbed that Plan B was his only real plan, since Plan A required unattainable gravitational singularity data from within a black hole.On Manns frozen planet, the Endurance crew revive Mann from cryostasis. He assures them colonization is possible, despite an extreme environment. On an excursion, Mann attempts to kill Cooper and reveals that he broadcast falsified data in the hope of being rescued. He steals a lander and heads for the Endurance. While a booby trap set by Mann kills Romilly, Amelia rescues Cooper with a second lander and they race to the Endurance. Mann is killed in a failed manual docking operation, severely damaging the Endurance. After a difficult docking maneuver, Cooper regains control of Endurance. With insufficient fuel, they head for Edmunds planet, with the embryos, using a slingshot maneuver so close to Gargantua that time dilation adds another 51 years. In the process, to save weight, Cooper jettisons himself and TARS in two landers to ensure Endurance can reach Edmunds planet. Slipping through  the event horizon of Gargantua, they eject from their respective landers and find themselves in a tesseract, possibly constructed by humans of the far future. Across time, Cooper can see through the bookcases of Murphs old room on Earth and weakly interact with its gravity. Realizing that he is now Murphs ""ghost"", he manipulates the second hand of the wristwatch he gave her, transmitting the quantum data that TARS collected from inside the event horizon via Morse code.The tesseract, its purpose completed, collapses and ejects Cooper and TARS. Cooper awakes on a space habitat orbiting Saturn. He reunites with his daughter, now an old woman nearing death. Using the quantum data, she was able to develop the gravitational propulsion theory, enabling humanitys exodus and transformation into an advanced spacefaring civilization. She reminds Cooper that Amelia is out there alone. Cooper and TARS take a spacecraft to rejoin Amelia and CASE, who are setting up a human colony on Edmunds habitable planet.",165000000,"[{""id"": 12, ""name"": ""Adventure""}, {""id"": 18, ""name"": ""Drama""}, {""id"": 878, ""name"": ""Science Fiction""}]",http://www.interstellarmovie.net/,157336,"[{""id"": 83, ""name"": ""saving the world""}, {""id"": 310, ""name"": ""artificial intelligence""}, {""id"": 494, ""name"": ""father son relationship""}, {""id"": 641, ""name"": ""single parent""}, {""id"": 1432, ""name"": ""nasa""}, {""id"": 1963, ""name"": ""expedition""}, {""id"": 3417, ""name"": ""wormhole""}, {""id"": 3801, ""name"": ""space travel""}, {""id"": 4337, ""name"": ""famine""}, {""id"": 4380, ""name"": ""black hole""}, {""id"": 4565, ""name"": ""dystopia""}, {""id"": 4776, ""name"": ""race against time""}, {""id"": 8056, ""name"": ""quantum mechanics""}, {""id"": 9831, ""name"": ""spaceship""}, {""id"": 9882, ""name"": ""space""}, {""id"": 10084, ""name"": ""rescue""}, {""id"": 10235, ""name"": ""family relationships""}, {""id"": 13127, ""name"": ""farmhouse""}, {""id"": 14544, ""name"": ""robot""}, {""id"": 14626, ""name"": ""astronaut""}, {""id"": 14760, ""name"": ""scientist""}, {""id"": 15300, ""name"": ""father daughter relationship""}, {""id"": 33479, ""name"": ""single father""}, {""id"": 154846, ""name"": ""farmer""}, {""id"": 156039, ""name"": ""space station""}, {""id"": 156395, ""name"": ""imax""}, {""id"": 160331, ""name"": ""astrophysics""}, {""id"": 162630, ""name"": ""zero gravity""}, {""id"": 189098, ""name"": ""courage""}, {""id"": 208757, ""name"": ""time paradox""}, {""id"": 214349, ""name"": ""relativity""}]",en,Interstellar chronicles the adventures of a group of explorers who make use of a newly discovered wormhole to surpass the limitations on human space travel and conquer the vast distances involved in an interstellar voyage.,724.247784,"[{""name"": ""Paramount Pictures"", ""id"": 4}, {""name"": ""Legendary Pictures"", ""id"": 923}, {""name"": ""Warner Bros."", ""id"": 6194}, {""name"": ""Syncopy"", ""id"": 9996}, {""name"": ""Lynda Obst Productions"", ""id"": 13769}]","[{""iso_3166_1"": ""CA"", ""name"": ""Canada""}, {""iso_3166_1"": ""US"", ""name"": ""United States of America""}, {""iso_3166_1"": ""GB"", ""name"": ""United Kingdom""}]",11/5/2014,675120017,169,"[{""iso_639_1"": ""en"", ""name"": ""English""}]",Released,Mankind was born on Earth.

339,340,Into the Woods,2014,/wiki/Into_the_Woods_(film),"A baker (James Corden) and his wife (Emily Blunt) wish for a child but suffer under a curse laid upon the bakers family by a Witch (Meryl Streep) who found the bakers father robbing her garden when his mother was pregnant. Because the bakers father also stole some magic beans, the witchs own mother cursed her to be ugly. The witch is able to lift the curse and allow them to have a child, but only if the baker and his wife obtain four critical items for her to make a potion: a white cow, a red cape, a yellow strand of hair, and a golden slipper, none of which she is allowed to touch.The witchs demands eventually bring the baker and his wife into contact with Jack (Daniel Huttlestone), who is selling his beloved cow, Milky-White, and to whom the baker offers magic beans left him by his father (which were stolen from the witch) which grow into a large beanstalk; with Red Riding Hood (Lilla Crawford), whose red cape the couple noticed when she stopped by the bakery earlier to buy bread and sweets on her way to grandmothers house; with blonde-haired Rapunzel (MacKenzie Mauzy), whose tower the bakers wife passes in the woods; and with Cinderella (Anna Kendrick), who also runs into the bakers wife while fleeing from the pursuing prince (Chris Pine) and whose ball outfit includes gold slippers.After a series of failed attempts and misadventures, the baker and his wife are finally able to gather the items necessary to break the spell. Meanwhile, each of the other characters receives a ""happy ending"": Cinderella marries the prince; Rapunzel is freed from her guardian, the witch, by Cinderellas princes brother and marries him; Jack provides for his mother by stealing riches from the Giant in the sky, and kills the pursuing giant by cutting down the beanstalk; Little Red Riding Hood and her grandmother are saved from the Big Bad Wolf (Johnny Depp); and the witch regains her youth and beauty after drinking the potion.However, each of the characters learns that their endings dont remain happy: the baker is worried that he is a poor father to his newborn baby; the bakers wife is temporarily seduced by the prince; Cinderella is disenchanted by her cheating prince; and the witch learns that she has lost her magic powers. The growth of a second beanstalk from the last remaining magic bean allows the giants wife to climb down and threaten the kingdom and its inhabitants if they do not deliver Jack in retribution for killing her husband. The characters attempt to find Jack, but debate the morality of handing Jack over. In the process, Red Riding Hoods mother and grandmother, Jacks mother, and the bakers wife are killed. The characters blame each other for their individual actions that led to the tragedy, ultimately blaming the witch for growing the beans in the first place. She curses them for their inability to accept responsibility for their individual actions. Casting all the remaining beans away, the witch begs her mother to punish her again, hoping to regain her powers, but instead she disappears into a large pit of boiling tar.The remaining characters resolve to kill the threatening giants wife though Cinderella and the baker try to explain to the distraught Red Riding Hood and Jack the complicated morality of retribution and revenge. The characters lure the giants wife into stepping in the tar pit where she ultimately trips and falls to her death. With the giants wife dead, the characters move forward with their ruined lives. The baker, thinking of his wife, is determined to be a good father. Cinderella decides to leave the prince and help the baker, and Jack and Red Riding Hood, now orphans, are living with the baker and Cinderella. The baker comforts his son after he begins to cry by telling the story of the film as the movie ends with the witchs moral, meaning that children can change due to the parents actions and behaviors.",50000000,"[{""id"": 14, ""name"": ""Fantasy""}, {""id"": 35, ""name"": ""Comedy""}, {""id"": 10402, ""name"": ""Music""}]",http://movies.disney.com/into-the-woods/,224141,"[{""id"": 616, ""name"": ""witch""}, {""id"": 995, ""name"": ""cinderella""}, {""id"": 3071, ""name"": ""prince""}, {""id"": 3205, ""name"": ""fairy tale""}, {""id"": 4344, ""name"": ""musical""}, {""id"": 7376, ""name"": ""princess""}, {""id"": 10449, ""name"": ""sondheim""}, {""id"": 10541, ""name"": ""curse""}, {""id"": 158375, ""name"": ""based on stage musical""}, {""id"": 166472, ""name"": ""beanstalk""}, {""id"": 179431, ""name"": ""duringcreditsstinger""}, {""id"": 192993, ""name"": ""red riding hood""}]",en,"In a woods filled with magic and fairy tale characters, a baker and his wife set out to end the curse put on them by their neighbor, a spiteful witch.",65.90161,"[{""name"": ""Walt Disney Pictures"", ""id"": 2}, {""name"": ""Marc Platt Productions"", ""id"": 2527}, {""name"": ""Lucamar Productions"", ""id"": 17021}]","[{""iso_3166_1"": ""US"", ""name"": ""United States of America""}]",12/25/2014,212902372,125,"[{""iso_639_1"": ""en"", ""name"": ""English""}]",Released,Be careful what you wish for...,Into the Woods,5.6,1652,0.061586678,0.02929464,0.5,0.135431796,0.364568204,-0.47070536,0.032292038,0.289188534,4.25804744
340,341,Iron Man,2010,/wiki/Iron_Man_(2008_film),"Genius, billionaire, playboy and philanthropist Tony Stark, who has inherited the defense contractor Stark Industries from his father, is in war-torn Afghanistan with his friend and military liaison Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes to demonstrate the new ""Jericho"" missile. After the demonstration, the convoy is ambushed and Stark is critically wounded by one of his own companys rocket-propelled grenades, used by the attackers. He is captured and imprisoned in a cave by a terrorist group, the Ten Rings; Yinsen, a fellow captive who is a doctor, implants an electromagnet into Starks chest to keep the shrapnel shards that wounded him from reaching his heart and killing him. Ten Rings leader Raza offers Stark freedom in exchange for building a Jericho missile for the group, but Tony and Yinsen know that Raza will not keep his word.Stark and Yinsen secretly build a small, powerful electric generator called an arc reactor to power Starks electromagnet and a prototypical suit of powered armor to aid in their escape. Although they keep the suit hidden almost to completion, the Ten Rings discover their hostages intentions and attack the workshop. Yinsen sacrifices himself to divert them while the suit is completed. The armored Stark battles his way out of the cave to find the dying Yinsen, then burns the Ten Rings weapons in anger and flies away, crashing in the desert and destroying the suit in the process. After being rescued by Rhodes, Stark returns home and announces that his company will no longer manufacture weapons. Obadiah Stane, his fathers old partner and the companys manager, advises Stark that this may ruin Stark Industries and his fathers legacy. In his home workshop, Stark builds a sleeker, more powerful version of his improvised armor suit as well as a more powerful arc reactor for his chest. Personal assistant Pepper Potts places the original reactor inside a small glass showcase. Though Stane requests details, Stark keeps his work to himself because he is suspicious of his company.At a charity event held by Stark Industries, reporter Christine Everhart informs Stark that his companys weapons, including the Jericho, were recently delivered to the Ten Rings and are being used to attack Yinsens home village, Gulmira. Stark then learns that Stane has been arms trafficking to criminals worldwide, and is staging a coup to replace him as Stark Industries CEO. Stark dons his new armor and flies to Afghanistan, where he saves the villagers. While flying home, Stark is shot at by two F-22 Raptor fighter jets. He reveals his secret identity to Rhodes over the phone in an attempt to end the attack. Meanwhile, the Ten Rings gather the pieces of Starks prototype suit and meet with Stane, who subdues Raza and has the rest of the group killed. Stane has a massive new suit reverse engineered from the wreckage. Seeking to track his companys illegal shipments, Stark sends Potts to hack into its database. She discovers that Stane hired the Ten Rings to kill Stark, but the group reneged. Potts meets with Agent Phil Coulson of S.H.I.E.L.D., an intelligence agency, to inform him of Stanes activities.Stanes scientists cannot duplicate Starks miniaturized arc reactor, so Stane ambushes Stark at his home and takes the one from his chest. Stark manages to get to his original reactor to replace it. Potts and several S.H.I.E.L.D. agents attempt to arrest Stane, but he dons his suit and attacks them. Stark fights Stane, but is outmatched without his new reactor to run his suit at full capacity. The fight carries Stark and Stane to the top of the Stark Industries building, and Stark instructs Potts to overload the large arc reactor powering the building. This unleashes a massive electrical surge that causes Stane and his armor to fall into the exploding reactor, killing him. The next day, at a press conference, Stark defies suggestions from S.H.I.E.L.D. and publicly admits to being the superhero the press has dubbed ""Iron Man"".In a post-credits scene, S.H.I.E.L.D.

346,347,J. Edgar,2011,/wiki/J._Edgar,"In 1919, after anarchists attempt to assassinate Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer, he puts his protegé J. Edgar Hoover in charge of a new division dedicated to purging radicals. Hoover quickly begins compiling a list of suspects. He meets Helen Gandy, a new secretary at the Justice Department, and takes her to the Library of Congress to show her the card catalog system he devised. He makes an awkward pass at her, then proposes to her. She refuses him, but agrees to become his personal secretary.Hoover finds that the Department of Labor refuses to deport anyone without evidence of a crime. Learning that Anthony Caminetti, the Commissioner General of Immigration, dislikes the anarchist Emma Goldman, Hoover arranges to make her eligible for deportation and thereby creates a precedent of deportation for radical conspiracy.  Following several such Justice Department raids of suspected radical groups, Palmer loses his job as Attorney General. His successor, Harlan F. Stone, appoints Hoover as director of the Justice Departments new Bureau of Investigation. Hoover meets lawyer Clyde Tolson, and hires him.When the Lindbergh kidnapping captures national attention, President Herbert Hoover asks the Bureau to investigate. Hoover employs several novel techniques, including the monitoring of registration numbers on ransom bills and expert analysis of the kidnappers handwriting. When the monitored bills begin showing up in New York City, the investigators find a filling station attendant who wrote down the license plate number of the man who gave him the bill. This leads to the arrest, and eventual conviction, of Bruno Richard Hauptmann for the kidnapping and murder of the Lindbergh child.After Hoover, Tolson, and Hoovers mother (with whom Hoover still lives) see the James Cagney film G Men, Hoover and Tolson go out to a club, where Hoover is seated with Anita Colby, Ginger Rogers, and Rogers mother Lela. Rogers mother asks Hoover to dance and he becomes agitated, saying that he and Tolson must leave, as they have a lot of work to do in the morning. When he gets home, he tells his mother that he dislikes dancing with girls. She tells him she would rather he be dead than a ""daffodil"". She insists on teaching him to dance, and they dance in her bedroom.Hoover and Tolson go on a vacation to the horse races. That evening, Hoover tells Tolson that he cares deeply for him, and Tolson tells Hoover that he loves him. Hoover panics and claims that he wants to marry Dorothy Lamour. Tolson accuses Hoover of making a fool out of him and they end up fighting on the floor. Tolson suddenly kisses Hoover, who says that must never happen again; Tolson says that it wont, and tries to leave. Hoover apologizes and begs him to stay, but Tolson threatens to end their friendship if Hoover talks about another woman again. After Tolson leaves, Hoover says that he loves him, too.Years later, Hoover feels his strength begin to decline, while Tolson suffers a stroke. Hoover tries to blackmail Martin Luther King, Jr. into declining his Nobel Peace Prize, sending him a letter threatening to expose his extramarital affairs. King disregards this and accepts the prize.Hoover tells Gandy to destroy his secret files after his death in order to prevent President Richard Nixon from possessing them. He visits Tolson, who urges him to retire. Hoover refuses, claiming that Nixon is going to destroy the bureau he has created. Tolson accuses Hoover of having exaggerated his involvement with key events of the Bureau. Moments later, Hoover tells Tolson that he needed Tolson more than he ever needed anyone else. He holds Tolsons hand, kisses his forehead, and leaves.Hoover returns home from work, obviously weakened. Shortly after Hoover goes upstairs, his housekeeper calls Tolson, who goes to the house and finds Hoover dead next to his bed. A grief-stricken Tolson covers his friends body. Nixon gives a memorial speech on television for Hoover, while several members of his staff enter Hoovers office and search through the cabinets and drawers in search of his rumored ""confidential"" files, but find nothing. In the last scene, Gandy destroys stacks of files.",35000000,"[{""id"": 18, ""name"": ""Drama""}, {""id"": 80, ""name"": ""Crime""}, {""id"": 36, ""name"": ""History""}]",http://jedgarmovie.warnerbros.com/dvd/,88794,"[{""id"": 5565, ""name"": ""biography""}, {""id"": 6165, ""name"": ""historical figure""}, {""id"": 34023, ""name"": ""fbi director""}]",en,"As the face of law enforcement in America for almost 50 years, J.

347,348,Jack and Jill,2011,/wiki/Jack_and_Jill_(2011_film),"Home videos show fraternal twins Jack and Jill Sadelstein growing up in New York City. Jack is the gifted twin, while Jill constantly tries—and fails miserably—to get his attention by injuring him and/or driving others away from him. In present-day Los Angeles, Jack is a successful advertising executive who lives with his wife Erin and their two kids Sofia and Gary, a Hindu child they adopted at birth. Jill never left the working-class neighborhood they grew up in; she recently inherited the Sadelstein home, having lived with their mother until her death a year ago.As always, Jack is irritated by the upcoming Thanksgiving visit of his sister. Jill ruins Thanksgiving dinner by loudly embarrassing a homeless guest. Jack snaps at his sister, making Jill run into the woods with her pet cockatoo Poopsie. Erin demands that Jack apologize, which he unwillingly does. Jill has a list of things she wants to do while in Los Angeles: be on a game show (The Price is Right, which gives Jill a carload of prizes after she knocks herself out while spinning the wheel); go horseback riding (she proves too heavy for the pony, which collapses under her); and do a studio tour. Since Jill has an open-ended plane ticket, she decides to stay until after Hanukkah, to Jacks horror. Jack encourages Jill to try online dating, but she is unsuccessful until Jack alters her profile. When Jills date ""Funbucket"" meets her, he hides in the mens room until she leaves the restaurant.Jacks agency client, meanwhile, wants him to somehow get actor Al Pacino to appear in a Dunkin Donuts commercial to promote a new coffee called the ""Dunkaccino"". Jack takes Jill to a Lakers game where Pacino is supposed to be. Pacino ignores Jack but is taken with Jill and gives her his phone number. Jack hopes Jill will go home by New Years Eve, as the family is going on a cruise. Jacks friends and colleagues throw him a birthday party, extending the invite to Jill. Again Jill loudly disgraces herself, Jack, and the various celebrities in attendance. Pacino brings Jill to his home, but despite his infatuation with her, she is uninterested with him and soon leaves. Jacks Mexican gardener Felipe, also smitten with Jill, takes her to meet his family at their annual fiesta, where she hits it off with everybody, and tries Mexican food for the first time, acquiring a horrible case of diarrhea.Pacino refuses to do the commercial unless Jack gets him another date with Jill; to that end, Jack invites Jill on the cruise with his family. At sea, Jill refuses to see Pacino again, so Jack disguises himself as his sister and goes on her date with Pacino. Jill suspects that she was only invited just so Pacino would do the commercial; that is confirmed when she phones Jack, he answers as Jill, and hears Pacino in the background. Pacino, still believing Jack to be Jill, spells out that he sees Jill as an unrecognized woman proud of her brothers success. Feeling guilty, Jack returns to the ship, only to learn that Jill has gone back home to The Bronx. At a restaurant on New Years Eve, toting a picture of her and Jacks late mother, Jill comes across a group of former classmates and bullies, led by Monica, who pick up directly where they left off until Jack, Erin and their kids show up. Jack and Jill converse in their made-up twin language (which even Jack finds incomprehensible). Monica attacks Erin and is cold cocked by Jill. Pacino also turns up at the party, dressed as the Man of La Mancha, and tells Jill that while he has feelings for her, there is another man more worthy of her than himself. She goes home, where Felipe and his children await her arrival. Felipe professes his love for Jill, and the two begin a relationship.The television commercial is made, with Pacino starring and singing a rap song.

348,349,Jack Reacher,2012,/wiki/Jack_Reacher_(film),"In Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, a man drives a van into a parking garage across the Allegheny River from PNC Park and, after dropping a quarter into the meter, readies a sniper rifle. He takes aim and kills five people on the rivers North Shore Trail from long range before fleeing in the van.The police soon arrive at the scene of the murder, headed by Detective Emerson (David Oyelowo), and discover a shell casing as well as the quarter used to pay for parking. A fingerprint taken from the coin points to James Barr (Joseph Sikora), a former U.S. Army sniper. When the police raid his house, they find the van, equipment for reloading rifle cartridges, the rifle in question, and Barr asleep in his bed.During an interrogation by Emerson and the District Attorney, Alex Rodin (Richard Jenkins), Barr is offered a choice between life in prison in exchange for a full confession or guaranteed death row, as Rodin has never lost a conviction. Thinking Barr is going to confess when he takes the notepad, they are bewildered when he instead writes ""Get Jack Reacher"". Jack Reacher (Tom Cruise) is a drifter and former U.S. Army Military Police Corps officer. He arrives in Pittsburgh after seeing a news report about Barr and the shooting. Emerson and Rodin deny Reachers request to view the evidence but agree to let him see  Barr, who was brutally attacked by fellow inmates while in police custody and is now in a coma. Reacher meets Barrs defense attorney, counselor Helen Rodin (Rosamund Pike), the District Attorneys daughter, who has been saddled with the apparently hopeless task of saving Barr from the death penalty.Helen says she can arrange for Reacher to see the evidence if he will become her lead investigator. Reacher retorts that he is not interested in clearing Barr. He reveals that Barr had gone on a killing spree during his tour in Iraq but was not prosecuted because, unbeknownst to Barr, his victims were under investigation for numerous rapes and the U.S. Army wanted them forgotten. Reacher vowed that if Barr tried anything like this again, he would take him down.Reacher agrees to investigate if Helen visits the victims families to learn about the people murdered that day. Reacher goes to the crime scene and finds inconsistencies about this location, thinking that a trained shooter would have done the killings from the cover of the van on the nearby Fort Duquesne Bridge. After Helen reports her findings about the victims to Reacher, he suggests that the owner of a local construction company was the intended victim, while the other victims served as a cover-up.After an apparently spurious bar fight, Reacher realizes that someone is attempting to strong-arm him into dropping his investigation. Reacher is later framed for the murder of the young woman (Alexia Fast) who was paid to instigate the bar-room brawl, but this only motivates him further. Reacher eventually follows up a lead at a shooting range in the neighboring state of Ohio, owned by former U.S. Marine Corps Gunnery Sergeant Martin Cash (Robert Duvall), who will talk only if Reacher will demonstrate his U.S. Army sniping skills.The real perpetrators are gang members masquerading as legitimate businessmen. The gangs elderly leader (Werner Herzog) spent much of his life in a Soviet Gulag and is known only as the Zec (prisoner). The gang kidnaps Helen with the aid of Detective Emerson and holds her hostage at a quarry. After he steals Helens Mercedes-Benz, Reacher outwits the mob guards, killing them with Cashs help, before confronting the Zec about the conspiracy. Zec points out that Reacher has killed most of the witnesses against him and doubts that he would be convicted. Reacher shoots the Zec in the head on the spot.Reacher and Cash flee the scene with confidence that Helen will clear Reachers name. When Barr awakens from his coma, he tells Helen that he has no recent memory but believes that he must be guilty of the shootings. Barrs mental reconstruction of how he would have committed the shootings confirms that Reachers theory was correct from the beginning. Still unaware of all these developments, Barr is willing to confess and accept his punishment, fearing that Reacher will mete out justice if the law does not.",60000000,"[{""id"": 80, ""name"": ""Crime""}, {""id"": 18, ""name"": ""Drama""}, {""id"": 53, ""name"": ""Thriller""}]",http://www.jackreachermovie.com/,75780,"[{""id"": 818, ""name"": ""based on novel""}, {""id"": 1589, ""name"": ""sniper""}, {""id"": 5340, ""name"": ""investigation""}, {""id"": 6149, ""name"": ""police""}, {""id"": 180124, ""name"": ""quarry""}]",en,"In an innocent heartland city, five are shot dead by an expert sniper.

349,350,Jack the Giant Slayer,2013,/wiki/Jack_the_Giant_Slayer,"In the Kingdom of Cloister, Jack, a young farm boy, is fascinated by the legend of Erik, an ancient king who defeated an army of invading giants from a realm in the sky by controlling them with a magical crown. At the same time, Princess Isabelle becomes fascinated with the same legend.Ten years later, Jack goes into town to sell his horse to support his uncles farm. There, Jack spots Isabelle and becomes enamored with her after defending her honor from a group of hooligans. Meanwhile, Lord Roderick returns to his study, only to find that a monk has robbed him. The monk offers Jack some magic beans he stole from Roderick as collateral for Jacks horse. Back at the castle, Isabelle quarrels with her father King Brahmwell as she wants to explore the kingdom, but he wants her to stay and marry Roderick. Likewise, Jacks uncle scolds him for being foolish before throwing the beans on the floor and leaving the house.Determined to be free, Isabelle sneaks out of the castle and seeks shelter from the rain in Jacks house. As it rains, one of the beans takes root and grows into a massive beanstalk that carries the house and Isabelle into the sky as Jack falls to the ground.Jack, Roderick, and Rodericks attendant Wicke volunteer to join the kings knights, led by Elmont and his second in-command, Crawe, and climb the beanstalk in search of Isabelle. As they climb, Roderick and Wicke cut the safety rope, intentionally killing some of the knights. At the top, they discover the giants realm and decide to split into two groups: one with Jack, Elmont, and Crawe, and the other including Roderick and Wicke, but not before Roderick forcibly takes the remaining beans from Jack (although Jack manages to save one for himself).Jacks group is trapped by a giant, who takes everyone prisoner except Jack. Meanwhile, Rodericks group encounters two other giants; one eats Wicke, but before the other can do the same to Roderick, Roderick dons the magical crown.Jack follows the giant to their stronghold, where the two-headed giant leader, Fallon, has killed Crawe. Jack finds Isabelle and Elmont imprisoned there. As the giants prepare to kill their remaining prisoners, Roderick walks in and enslaves the giants with the crown. He tells the giants they will attack Cloister at dawn and gives them permission to eat Isabelle and Elmont. Jack rescues Isabelle and Elmont as one of the giants prepares to cook Elmont as a pig-in-a-blanket. The trio makes for the beanstalk, where Jack causes the giant guarding the beanstalk to fall off the realms edge. Seeing the giants body, Brahmwell orders the beanstalk cut down to avoid an invasion by the giants.Jack and Isabelle head down the beanstalk, while Elmont stays to confront Roderick. Elmont kills Roderick, but Fallon takes the crown before Elmont can claim it, and Elmont is forced to escape down the beanstalk. Jack, Isabelle, and Elmont all survive the fall after the beanstalk is cut down. As everyone returns home, Jack warns that the giants are using Rodericks beans to create beanstalks to descend down to Earth and attack Cloister.The giants chase Jack, Isabelle, and Brahmwell into the castle, where Elmont fills the moat with oil and sets it on fire. Fallon falls in the moat and breaks into the castle from below. As the siege continues, Fallon captures Jack and Isabelle, but Jack throws the final bean down Fallons throat, before the giant can eat the princess, causing a beanstalk to rip apart his body. Jack takes the crown and sends the giants back to their realm.Jack and Isabelle marry and tell the story of the giants to their children.

350,351,Jason Bourne,2016,/wiki/Jason_Bourne_(film),"A decade after he exposed Operation Blackbriar (as seen in The Bourne Ultimatum) and disappeared, Jason Bourne has finally recovered from his amnesia, isolating himself from the world and making a living by taking part in savage, bareknuckle fighting bouts. In Reykjavík, Nicky Parsons, who has been collaborating with a hacktivist group led by Christian Dassault, hacks into the CIAs mainframe computer server to expose its black ops programs. This alerts Heather Lee, the head of the agencys cybersecurity operations division, and CIA director Robert Dewey. In the process, Parsons finds documentation concerning Bournes recruitment into Treadstone and his fathers role in the program. She travels to Athens to find and inform him.In Greece, Parsons and Bourne meet at Syntagma Square during a violent anti-government protest. They evade CIA teams sent after them, but Parsons is shot by the Asset, an ex-Blackbriar assassin who also holds a personal grudge against Bourne, having been captured and tortured as an unintentional consequence of Bournes exposure of Blackbriar. Before she dies, Parsons passes Bourne the key to a locker which holds the CIA files.Seeking answers about his past and family, Bourne locates Dassault in Berlin. Decrypting Parsons files, Bourne discovers that his father, Richard Webb, was a CIA analyst involved in the creation of the Treadstone program. A malware program implanted in the files gives the CIA Bournes location, and Dewey sends a team to capture him, while Lee remotely erases the files. Dassault attacks Bourne, but is incapacitated. Lee alerts Bourne to the team closing in, as she believes that he can be persuaded to return to the agency. Using the few leads he gathered in Berlin, Bourne tracks Malcolm Smith, a former Treadstone surveillance operative, in London and arranges to meet him in Paddington Plaza.Lee persuades Deweys boss, Edwin Russell, the Director of National Intelligence, to allow her to contact Bourne in person to attempt to bring him back in. Dewey, who opposes her plan, secretly authorizes the Asset to eliminate her team and kill Bourne. Bourne evades Lee and the Asset long enough to confront Smith. Smith admits that Richard Webb created Treadstone, but tried to prevent them from recruiting his son. Under Deweys orders, the Asset killed Richard Webb in Beirut, making it look like a terrorist attack, in order to persuade Bourne to join Treadstone. Smith is killed by the Asset, while Bourne escapes and finds Lee. She admits that she is not comfortable with Deweys methods and directs Bourne to a technology convention in Las Vegas.Dewey is scheduled to attend the convention for a public debate on privacy rights with Aaron Kalloor, CEO of social media giant Deep Dream. Kalloor is the public face of corporate social responsibility in the Internet age, but he was secretly funded by Dewey in the startup stage. Dewey intends to use Deep Dream for real-time mass surveillance alongside the latest incarnation of the CIAs targeted assassination Beta program, known as ""Iron Hand"". When Kalloor has second thoughts about giving the CIA access to Deep Dream, Dewey authorizes the Asset to assassinate Kalloor and Lee—having discovered her conspiracy moments ago. Bourne thwarts the assassinations and confronts Dewey in his suite. Dewey appeals to Bournes sense of patriotism as he stalls for time, before his right-hand man Craig Jeffers intervenes. Bourne kills Jeffers, only to get shot in the process; however, he is saved when Lee shoots Dewey dead before he could shoot Bourne. After covering Lees involvement in Deweys death, Bourne pursues the Asset on the Las Vegas Strip and chases him down into the sewers after the pair end up crashing into a casino; they engage in a savage combat that ends with Bourne snapping the Assets neck, killing him.In the aftermath, Lee convinces Russell that Deweys methods were outdated and offers herself as Deweys replacement as CIA director and Russells eyes and ears within the CIA. She outlines her plan to use Bournes trust to bring him back to the agency, but is prepared to kill him if he refuses. Lee meets with Bourne, promising him that the CIA will become the organization he thought it was when he joined. Bourne asks for time to consider her offer and walks away.  Lee returns to her car and finds a recording, made by Bourne, of the conversation she had with Russell which reveals her true intentions about murdering Bourne as she says ""he needs to be put down"".",120000000,"[{""id"": 28, ""name"": ""Action""}, {""id"": 53, ""name"": ""Thriller""}]",http://www.jasonbournemovie.com,324668,"[{""id"": 782, ""name"": ""assassin""}, {""id"": 1453, ""name"": ""amnesia""}, {""id"": 187844, ""name"": ""flashback""}]",en,The most dangerous former operative of the CIA is drawn out of hiding to uncover hidden truths about his past.,62.641286,"[{""name"": ""The Kennedy/Marshall Company"", ""id"": 862}, {""name"": ""Captivate Entertainment"", ""id"": 25716}, {""name"": ""Pearl Street Films"", ""id"": 29313}, {""name"": ""Double Negative"", ""id"": 31922}, {""name"": ""Perfect World (Beijing) Pictures Co."", ""id"": 83871}]","[{""iso_3166_1"": ""GB"", ""name"": ""United Kingdom""}, {""iso_3166_1"": ""US"", ""name"": ""United States of America""}, {""iso_3166_1"": ""CN"", ""name"": ""China""}]",7/27/2016,415484914,123,"[{""iso_639_1"": ""en"", ""name"": ""English""}]",Released,You know his name,Jason Bourne,5.9,2341,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0,0,0,0,3.462374283
351,352,John Carter,2012,/wiki/John_Carter_(film),"The film begins in 1881 after the sudden death of John Carter, a former American Civil War Confederate Army captain. His nephew, Edgar Rice Burroughs, attends the funeral. As per Carters instructions, the body is put in a tomb that can be unlocked only from the inside. His attorney hands over Carters personal journal for Burroughs to read, in the hope of finding clues explaining Carters cause of death.The anecdote moves back to 1868 in the Arizona Territory, where Union Colonel Powell arrests Carter. Powell, knowing about Carters military background, seeks his help in fighting the Apache.  Carter escapes his holding cell, but fails to get far with U.S. cavalry soldiers in close pursuit. After a run-in with a band of Apaches, Carter and a wounded Powell are chased until they take to hiding in a cave that turns out to be the object of Carters earlier searching, the Spider Cave of Gold. A Thern appears in the cave at that moment and, surprised by the two men, attacks them with a knife; Carter kills him but accidentally activates the Therns powerful medallion, and is unwittingly transported to a ruined and dying planet, Barsoom. Because of his different bone density and the planets low gravity, Carter is able to jump high and perform feats of incredible strength. He is captured by the Green Martian Tharks and their Jeddak Tars Tarkas.Elsewhere on Barsoom, the Red Martian cities of Helium and Zodanga have been at war for a thousand years. Sab Than, Jeddak of Zodanga, armed with a special weapon obtained from the Thern leader Matai Shang, proposes a cease-fire and an end to the war by marrying the Princess of Helium, Dejah Thoris. The Princess escapes and is rescued by Carter. Carter, Dejah, and Tarkas daughter Sola, embark on a quest to get to the end of a sacred river to find a way for Carter to get back home. They obtain information about the ""ninth ray"", a means of using infinite energy and also the key to understanding how the medallion works. But they are later attacked by Shangs minions, the Green Martians of Warhoon. After the attack, Carter is captured and taken back with Dejah while Sola is able to escape. The demoralized Dejah grudgingly agrees to marry Sab Than, then gives Carter his medallion and tells him to go back to Earth. Carter decides to stay and is captured by Shang, who explains to him the purpose of Therns and how they manipulate the civilizations of different planets. Carter is able to make an escape as he and Sola go back to the Tharks requesting their help. There they discover Tarkas has been overthrown by a ruthless brute, Tal Hajus. Tarkas, Carter, and Sola are put on trial in a colosseum battle with two enormous vicious creatures, the four-armed Great White-Apes. After defeating them and killing Hajus, Carter becomes the leader of the Tharks.The Thark army charges on Helium and defeats the Zodangan army by killing Sab Than, while Shang escapes. Carter becomes prince of Helium by marrying Dejah. On their first night, Carter decides to stay forever on Mars and throws away his medallion. Seizing this opportunity, Shang banishes him back to Earth. Carter then embarks in a long quest, looking for clues of the Therns presence on Earth and hoping to find one of their medallions; after several years he appears to die suddenly and asks for unusual funeral arrangements—consistent with his having found a medallion, since his return to Mars would leave his Earth body in a coma-like state. He makes Burroughs his protector, giving him clues about how to open the tomb.The story reverts to the present, where Burroughs runs back to Carters tomb and opens it, only to find it empty. A Thern, disguised as man with a bowler hat who has been observing Carter, suddenly appears, having followed Burroughs. But as the Thern prepares to kill Burroughs, Carter appears and kills the Thern. Carter then tells Burroughs that he never found a medallion. Instead, he devised a scheme to lure one of the Therns into revealing himself. Carter takes his medallion, whispers the code, and is then transported back to Barsoom.",260000000,"[{""id"": 28, ""name"": ""Action""}, {""id"": 12, ""name"": ""Adventure""}, {""id"": 878, ""name"": ""Science Fiction""}]",http://movies.disney.com/john-carter,49529,"[{""id"": 818, ""name"": ""based on novel""}, {""id"": 839, ""name"": ""mars""}, {""id"": 1456, ""name"": ""medallion""}, {""id"": 3801, ""name"": ""space travel""}, {""id"": 7376, ""name"": ""princess""}, {""id"": 9951, ""name"": ""alien""}, {""id"": 10028, ""name"": ""steampunk""}, {""id"": 10539, ""name"": ""martian""}, {""id"": 10685, ""name"": ""escape""}, {""id"": 161511, ""name"": ""edgar rice burroughs""}, {""id"": 163252, ""name"": ""alien race""}, {""id"": 179102, ""name"": ""superhuman strength""}, {""id"": 190320, ""name"": ""mars civilization""}, {""id"": 195446, ""name"": ""sword and planet""}, {""id"": 207928, ""name"": ""19th century""}, {""id"": 209714, ""name"": ""3d""}]",en,"John Carter is a war-weary, former military captain who's inexplicably transported to the mysterious and exotic planet of Barsoom (Mars) and reluctantly becomes embroiled in an epic conflict.

352,353,Jonah Hex,2010,/wiki/Jonah_Hex_(film),"During the American Civil War, Jonah Hex (Josh Brolin) served as a Confederate cavalryman until his commanding officer, Quentin Turnbull (John Malkovich), ordered him to burn down a hospital. Hex refused, and was forced to kill his best friend, Turnbulls son Jeb. After the war, Turnbull and his enforcer, Burke (Michael Fassbender), tie up Hex and force him to watch as his house is burned down with his wife and son inside. Turnbull then brands Hexs face with his initials and leaves him to die.  Days later, American Indians revive Jonah with their mystical powers, giving him the ability to temporarily resurrect the dead. When Turnbull apparently dies in a hotel fire, Hex satisfies his hunger for vengeance by turning to bounty hunting and sears the branded side of his face to cover up Turnbulls initials.In 1876, Turnbull, alive and well, hijacks a train carrying components of an experimental ""superweapon"", slaughtering its military guards and civilian passengers alike. When informed of the theft, President Grant (Aidan Quinn) surmises that Turnbull is planning a terrorist attack for July 4, during the American centennial. Grant instructs Army Lieutenant Grass (Will Arnett) to hire Hex to stop Turnbull. Jonah spends the night in a brothel with Lilah (Megan Fox), a prostitute attracted to the disfigured man for more than just professional reasons. As he prepares to leave the next morning, Grass men burst in and tell him that Turnbull is still alive. They show him a captured thug from the train hijacking who told them Turnbull is headed northwest, before dying during interrogation. Jonah briefly resurrects the man, who knows only that he was recruited by ex-Confederal Colonel Slocum (Tom Wopat), who is running an illegal deathmatch pavilion in South Carolina.With the help of a corrupt Washington aristocrat, Adleman Lusk (Wes Bentley), Turnbull steals the remaining components of the weapon, invented by Eli Whitney.When Hex confronts Slocum in South Carolina, Slocum refuses to talk, sarcastically telling Hex to ask Turnbulls dead son, Jeb, where his father is. Jonah then overpowers Slocums men and throws Slocum himself into the ring, to be killed by his own fighters. After setting fire to the ring, he frees a dog being tormented by Slocums handlers, which starts to follow him around. In a cemetery in Gettysburg, Jonah digs up and resurrects Jeb (an uncredited Jeffrey Dean Morgan). Jonah apologizes for killing Jeb, and says that his father has to be stopped before he murders more people. Jeb reveals that his father is at Fort Resurrection, before returning to the afterlife.After entering the fort, Jonah confronts Turnbull, killing several of his men, but Turnbull escapes and Hex receives a near-fatal wounding from Burke, but escapes. He collapses in a field, hovering near death for several days. Turnbull, anticipating Hexs return, sends Burke to bring him ""something Hex loves,"" so Burke kidnaps Lilah from the brothel. Turnbull test-fires the ""superweapon"" on a small town in Georgia, which is leveled to the ground, killing hundreds. When Grant receives the news, his aide reports that they have no idea where Turnbull will strike, and that they do not have enough military manpower to guard every centennial celebration.Hex is found by his Native American allies, who perform a ceremony that heals him. He relays a message to Lt. Grass that Turnbull plans to attack Washington, D.C., then rides to Independence Harbor alone to stop him. When Jonah attempts to infiltrate the harbor where Turnbulls ironclad warship is anchored, Burke spots him and attacks him. Hex overpowers and kills him, then resurrects him just to incinerate his body completely. Turnbull holds Lilah at gunpoint and forces Jonah to surrender. With Jonah and Lilah captive in the hold of his ship, Turnbull steams toward Washington. A monitor commanded by Lt. Grass intercepts Turnbull, but is quickly destroyed with the weapon.Lilah frees herself and Jonah, and holds off the guards while Jonah rushes up to the deck to stop Turnbull. Turnbull gains the upper hand and orders the weapon to fire, but the fight takes them into the engine room, where Hex jams the weapons belt feeder, trapping its trigger shell. He then brutally beats Turnbull and traps his neck in a gear, before saving Lilah. The pair jump into the water just as the trigger shell ignites, killing Turnbull and all his men. The next day, President Grant rewards Jonah with a large sum of money, a full pardon, and offers him a job as Sheriff of the entire United States. Jonah declines, but assures the president that if they need him, theyll be able to find him. Lilah is waiting for him outside the White House, and they leave the city together.Jonah visits Jebs grave to apologize for having to kill his father, then rides out of the cemetery with his dog.",47000000,"[{""id"": 28, ""name"": ""Action""}, {""id"": 37, ""name"": ""Western""}, {""id"": 18, ""name"": ""Drama""}, {""id"": 14, ""name"": ""Fantasy""}, {""id"": 53, ""name"": ""Thriller""}]",http://jonah-hex.warnerbros.com/,20533,"[{""id"": 75, ""name"": ""gunslinger""}, {""id"": 279, ""name"": ""usa""}, {""id"": 849, ""name"": ""dc comics""}, {""id"": 6154, ""name"": ""hell""}, {""id"": 15518, ""name"": ""facial scar""}, {""id"": 34079, ""name"": ""death""}, {""id"": 163188, ""name"": ""confederate""}, {""id"": 175261, ""name"": ""tomahawk""}]",en,"Gunslinger Jonah Hex (Josh Brolin) is appointed by President Ulysses Grant to track down terrorist Quentin Turnbull (John Malkovich), a former Confederate officer determined on unleashing hell on earth.

Hank manages to convince Liz to let both of them go in search of the island, in the slight hope of proving Sean wrong, that there is no so-called mysterious island there.They arrive in Palau where they need transportation to travel to this dangerous part of the ocean. A Palauan helicopter tourism guide Gabato (Luis Guzman) and his daughter Kailani (Vanessa Hudgens), whom Sean develops an immediate crush on, agree to fly them out to the island for $3,000, but the helicopter gets caught in a hurricane and they crash into the Pacific, waking up on the island.Moving into the island, they discover one of the laws of the Mysterious Island is that, traditionally small animals become large and large animals become small (inspired by Lilliput from Gullivers Travels). The crew discover tiny elephants and giant butterflies, which are the first creatures they come across on the island. The group decides to explore further into the island.After leaving that part of the island they come across an egg clutch belonging to a giant frilled lizard, they are then saved by Seans grandfather Alexander (Michael Caine) who takes them to a large hut hed built from the wreckage of the ship that brought him to the island, called the Blue-Eyed Lucy. He has a working radio, but due to the positioning of the communications satellite it will be two weeks before they can call for help.The next morning, Alexander leads the group to the lost city of Atlantis, which is periodically submerged in the ocean for extended times, and he also calculates that the island sinks once every 70 years. However, Hank discovers the sea water appearing from the ground is the evidence that Alexanders calculations are wrong, and that the island will sink in a couple of days. Their only means of salvation seems to be the legendary Nautilus (Captain Nemos submarine), hidden somewhere on the island. Kailani enters Nemos crypt and finds his journal, which shows the whereabouts of the ship in a cave at Poseidons Cliffs. They decide to go to that cave through the heart of the island.They mount giant bees in order to fly over a high ridge and make up time, but encounter large birds (spectacular bee-eaters, to be specific) that try to devour the bees. After saving Kailanis life, Sean crashes and dislocates his ankle. Hank and Alexander patch up Seans ankle the best way they can. Afterward, they have a bonding moment when Hank sings his rendition of ""What a Wonderful World"" to ease Seans pain.The next morning, the water has risen greatly and Hank deduces that the island will sink in a matter of hours, not days. Gabato is missing, having gone toward the islands golden volcano (inspired by Treasure Island) in search of gold to give his daughter a better life. While Alexander and Kailani go after him, Sean and Hank head for Poseidons Cliffs to look for the Nautilus. Alexander also finally calls Hank by his preferred name, as up to that point he only called him ""Henry"", and the family makes up.To deal with the rising water after finding the Nautilus cave underwater, Sean and Hank create makeshift oxygen tanks and dive down fifty feet in order to get to the Nautilus and are nearly killed by a giant electric eel. They are unable to power the ship however, because the vessels batteries have run down due to being 140 years old. They engineer a way to power the submarine from the electric eels electricity.Meanwhile, Kailani and Alexander find Gabato and convince him to escape with them instead of trying for the golden volcano. They head towards the shore as the island begins to suddenly and violently rip itself apart. The golden volcano starts to erupt violently, pouring lava all over the area. Highly flammable lava bombs are thrown from the golden volcano into the air and suddenly land on the sinking islands debris. Sean and Hank use a harpoon to get an electrical jump start from the electric eel swarming around them and they are able to power the machine, just in time to pick up the others who had fallen into the water. Gabato pilots the submarine out of harms way while Hank and Sean fire torpedoes into the path of falling island debris. As they clear the dangers, Kailani finally kisses Sean for his bravery.Six months later, Kailani and Gabato are well off. Gabato is now running the most popular tourist attraction on Palau providing tours aboard the Nautilus and Kailani is attending college. Kailani goes to visit Sean on his birthday. While they are celebrating, Alexander shows up with a book for Seans birthday present. Sean opens it to find Jules Vernes From the Earth to the Moon, Alexanders suggestion for a new adventure with the family, to which Liz protests. Hank replies ""What could possibly go wrong? Its only the moon!""During the credits, the mini-elephants from the earlier scene are swimming underwater over Atlantis.",79000000,"[{""id"": 12, ""name"": ""Adventure""}, {""id"": 28, ""name"": ""Action""}, {""id"": 878, ""name"": ""Science Fiction""}]",http://www.themysteriousisland.com/,72545,"[{""id"": 10364, ""name"": ""mission""}, {""id"": 40894, ""name"": ""mysterious island""}, {""id"": 156091, ""name"": ""missing person""}, {""id"": 179431, ""name"": ""duringcreditsstinger""}, {""id"": 209714, ""name"": ""3d""}]",en,"Sean Anderson partners with his mom's boyfriend on a mission to find his grandfather, who is thought to be missing on a mythical island.",40.723459,"[{""name"": ""New Line Cinema"", ""id"": 12}, {""name"": ""Contrafilm"", ""id"": 1836}, {""name"": ""Walden Media"", ""id"": 10221}]","[{""iso_3166_1"": ""US"", ""name"": ""United States of America""}]",1/19/2012,355692760,94,"[{""iso_639_1"": ""en"", ""name"": ""English""}]",Released,Believe the Impossible.

354,355,Joyful Noise,2012,/wiki/Joyful_Noise_(film),"After the untimely death of a small-town church choir director (Kris Kristofferson) in Pacashau, Georgia, Vi Rose Hill (Latifah), a no-nonsense mother raising two teens alone, takes control of the choir using the traditional Gospel style that their Pastor Dale (Courtney B. Vance) approves of. However, the directors widow, G. G. Sparrow (Parton), the main benefactor to the church, believes she should have been given the position. As in previous years, the choir reaches the regional finals of the national amateur ""Joyful Noise"" competition, only to be disappointed when a rival choir beats them. Tough times in the town have led to budget problems that threaten to close down the choir, at the same time as the town needs the choirs inspiring music more than ever.Vi Rose has a son, Walter (Dexter Darden), who has Asperger syndrome, and a talented, pretty and ready-to-date daughter, Olivia (Keke Palmer). But Olivia is not ready to date under her mothers household rules. G. G. has recently begun caring for her rebellious, drifter grandson, Randy (Jeremy Jordan). A romance blossoms between Olivia and Randy, which is strongly opposed by Vi Rose. Olivia also has a rival suitor, Manny (Paul Woolfolk). At Randys urging, G. G., Olivia and most of the choir come to believe that some more contemporary arrangements (prepared by Randy) would be more successful for the choir. It also turns out that the choir has a chance at the national finals of the competition when the rival choir is found to have cheated by hiring professionals. But the pastor says that the church will not sponsor the choir unless they continue to use their reverent, traditional style.Vi Roses husband, Marcus (Jesse L. Martin), enlisted in the army after having trouble finding work at home, but his prolonged absence has saddened his family and causes additional tension between Vi Rose and Olivia. Meanwhile, a vivacious member of the choir who choreographs their routines, Earla (Angela Grovey), after a long dry stretch, finds passion first with Mr. Hsu (Francis Jue), whose weak heart gives way by morning, and later with Justin (Roy Huang). The towns tough times forces another choir member, Caleb (Andy Karl), and his family out of business. Vi Rose and G. G. come to blows in a confrontation, Olivias frustration with her mother boils over, and G. G. threatens Pastor Dale with disendowing the church if the choir is not allowed to compete in the finals with the new arrangements.During the movie Randy befriends Walter and begins to teach him how to play the piano. One day, while at the quarry Randy and Walter are hanging out as Manny arrives. Randy and Manny begin to fight over Olivia ending with Randy giving Manny a bloody nose. When returning home Walter brags to Vi Rose about the fight. Angered by the news, she throws out Randy and tells him to leave her family alone. Randy, however, is able to befriend Manny and convince him to help out the choir with his guitar skills.The choir travels to Los Angeles for the finals, feeling very unsettled. Vi Rose and Olivia have a fight and Vi Rose slaps Olivia. Tough competition presents itself in the form of a choir made up of cute pre-teens, with a charismatic young soloist (Ivan Kelley Jr.). But Vi Rose, G. G., Olivia and Randy pull the choir together and they give a rousing performance, using the new arrangements and choreography, capturing first place. The choir returns to town in triumph.

356,357,Jupiter Ascending,2015,/wiki/Jupiter_Ascending,"Earth and countless other planets were established by families of transhuman and alien royalty for the purpose of later ""harvesting"" the resulting organisms to produce a type of youth serum for the elites on other planets. After the death of the matriarch of the House of Abrasax, the most powerful of the alien dynasties, her children, Balem, Kalique, and Titus, quarrel over the inheritance, with Balem inheriting an enormous refinery on Jupiter and Titus spending his inheritance on a lavish spaceship.Jupiter Jones narrates that her father, Maximilian Jones, met her mother, Aleksa, in Saint Petersburg, Russia. After Maximilian is killed in a robbery, Aleksa names their daughter Jupiter, after his favorite planet, and they move to Chicago to live with Aleksas family.Many years later, Jupiter Jones cleans the homes of wealthy neighbors. To buy a telescope, Jupiter agrees to sell her egg cells with the help of her cousin Vladie, under the name of her friend Katharine Dunlevy. At Katharines house, Jupiter and Katharine are attacked by extraterrestrial Keepers; and when Jupiter photographs these, they erase both of their memories of the incident. Jupiter stumbles upon the strange photograph on her phone while waiting at an egg donation clinic, but cannot recall anything about it. During the procedure, the doctors and nurses are revealed to be Keepers sent to kill her, and she is saved by Caine Wise, a former soldier sent by Titus to bring her to him.While Caine and Jupiter ascend to a ship, it is destroyed by a squad of Keepers who then attack them. Caine fends off the attack and manages to kill the Keepers and hijack one of their vehicles while protecting Jupiter. Afterwards, Caine realizes that Jupiter must be of great significance to both Titus and Balem, who is revealed to have sent the Keepers to Earth to capture her. He takes Jupiter to the hideout of Stinger Apini, another former soldier living in exile on Earth. As Jupiter discovers that she can control the bees in Stingers residence, she is revealed to be galactic royalty. Stinger agrees to help Jupiter, but a group of hunters who initially were hired by Balem but bribed by Kalique capture her and take her to Kaliques palace on a distant planet, where Kalique explains that Jupiter is genetically identical to the dead matriarch, and therefore the Earths rightful owner. Supported by Captain Diomika Tsing of the Aegis (an intergalactic police force), Caine retrieves her from Kalique, and takes her to the planet Ores (the intergalactic capital planet) to claim her inheritance.In another attempt to lure Jupiter to him, Balem sends Greeghan to kidnap Jupiters family. On the way back to Earth, Tituss henchmen capture Jupiter and detain Caine, as punishment for not bringing Jupiter to him as promised. Titus reveals to Caine his plan to marry and kill Jupiter and claim Earth. He then throws Caine into the void of space; he attempts to seduce Jupiter, declaring his intention to dismantle the youth serum trade, of which Earth is the next intended source.  Caine survives being spaced and returns with Stinger to save Jupiter at the altar before she completes the marriage contract. Jupiter asks to return home, but learns that her family has been taken hostage by Balem. In his refinery in the Great Red Spot, Balem demands Earth in exchange for Jupiters family. Realizing that Balem can ""harvest"" Earth only with her permission, Jupiter refuses. Caine infiltrates the refinery and damages its gravity hull, causing the refinery to begin collapsing. While the occupants evacuate the refinery, Tsings ship moves in and rescues Jupiters family.Jupiter survives the collapsing structures, only to land at the feet of Balem who tries to kill her; but she fights him off, and is rescued by Caine while Balem falls to his death. As the refinery is in its final stages of collapse, Tsing opens a portal to Earth and prepares to evacuate, potentially leaving Caine and Jupiter behind. However, she is relieved to find that they have survived and crossed the portal along with Tsings ship. Jupiters family is returned home with no memory of their disappearance, while Jupiter secretly retains ownership of the Earth.

361,362,Just Go with It,2011,/wiki/Just_Go_with_It,"In 1988, Daniel ""Danny"" Maccabee (Adam Sandler), a 22-year old man, leaves his wedding   right before the ceremony is about to begin after learning that his fiancee is     cheating on him, and was only marrying him because he was going to be a doctor. He goes to drink alone at a bar, where a young, beautiful woman walks in. She sees that Danny has a wedding ring on his hand, and asks him about his wife, to which he explains how she recently left him for someone else, and the woman from the bar ends up sleeping with him. Twenty-three years later, Danny (now 45 years old) is now a successful plastic surgeon in Los Angeles who feigns unhappy marriages to get women, and to avoid romantic commitment that may lead to heartbreak. The only woman aware of his schemes is his office manager and best friend Katherine Murphy (Jennifer Aniston), a divorced mother of two. At a party, Danny meets Palmer (Brooklyn Decker), a sixth grade math teacher, without his wedding ring on, and they have a connection together. The next morning, she finds the ring and assumes he is married. She refuses to date him because her parents divorced due to adultery.Instead of telling her the truth, Danny tells her that he is getting divorced from a woman named Devlin. Danny tells Palmer that they are getting divorced because she cheated on him with a man named ""Dolph Lundgren"" (not the actor). Palmer then insists on meeting Devlin. Danny asks Katherine to pose as ""Devlin"" and they go shopping for new clothes to dress like a trophy wife.A made-over Katherine/""Devlin"" then meets with Danny and Palmer and gives them her blessing. However, after hearing Katherine talking on the phone with her kids, Palmer assumes that her kids are Dannys as well. Danny then privately meets with Katherines kids, Maggie (Bailee Madison) and Michael (Griffin Gluck), to get them to play along and gives them the aliases of ""Kiki Dee"" and ""Bart"" respectively. Danny accepts their demands for being his fake children.Palmer meets the kids at a play center where Maggie has adopted a fake british accent, and Michael acts very morose. They blackmail Danny in front of Palmer to take them all to Hawaii. At the airport, they are all surprised by Dannys goofball cousin Eddie (Nick Swardson), who has adopted an Austrian disguise as the ""Dolph Lundgren"" that Danny had made up earlier. To maintain the lies, Danny and Katherine are forced to bring him along.At the resort in Hawaii, Danny tells Eddie that he is considering asking Palmer to marry him. Katherine and Danny also run into the real-life Devlin Adams (Nicole Kidman) and her husband Ian Maxtone-Jones (Dave Matthews). Because of Katherine and Devlins long-time rivalry, Katherine introduces Danny as her husband rather than admit she is a single mother. Over time, Katherine is impressed by Danny and his way of fun with her kids.Katherine again runs into Devlin, who invites her and Danny out to dinner. Eddie agrees to take Palmer out to dinner so that Danny can go with Katherine. Since he is supposed to be a sheep salesman, Eddies cover is nearly blown when he is forced to save the life of an actual sheep who choked on a toy whistle. At dinner, Devlin asks Danny and Katherine to tell each other what they admire most about each other, and, as Danny and Katherine talk, they start to feel a connection. Later, when Palmer and Eddie return from their dinner date, Palmer suggests that she and Danny get married now, since a drunken Eddie told her about Dannys plans of engagement. Danny and Katherine are both surprised by her proposition, but Danny ultimately agrees. Danny later calls Katherine regarding his confusion, but Katherine says that she will be taking a job in New York City to get a fresh start to her life.The next day, Palmer confronts Katherine about Dannys feelings for her, which Katherine dismisses. Katherine then runs into Devlin at a bar and admits that she pretended to be married to Danny to avoid embarrassment. Devlin confesses that she is divorcing Ian because he is gay and also that he did not invent the iPod, but made his money by suing the Los Angeles Dodgers after getting hit by a foul ball. Katherine confides in Devlin about being in love with Danny, but then Danny shows up behind her, saying that he is not marrying Palmer and that he is in love with Katherine. Meanwhile, on the plane ride back to the mainland, Palmer meets a professional tennis player (Andy Roddick) who shares her interests.

Various instances of praying together before a show are shown.The film also includes a visit Bieber made to his hometown while being in Canada for the tour. He is scolded for having damaged his voice while having fun with his old friends. Reluctantly he accepts the postponement of a performance in Syracuse. He is not allowed to speak for some days, and thus recovers enough to do the next performance, at MSG.Also included are some stories and old videos of Biebers childhood.

363,364,Keanu,2016,/wiki/Keanu_(film),"Smoke and Oil Dresden (Jordan Peele and Keegan-Michael Key), a pair of assassins known as the ""Allentown Brothers"", enter a drug-processing facility run by a Mexican drug cartel and kill everyone inside, including the boss King Diaz. The pair take Diazs cat Iglesias, but when they are momentarily distracted by policemen arriving, the cat escapes. Meanwhile, Rell (also played by Peele) has just been dumped by his girlfriend; he finds the cat on his doorstep, takes an immediate liking to it, and names it Keanu. Rells cousin Clarence (also played by Key) comes over to cheer him up and meets Keanu as well.Two weeks later, Clarences wife, Hannah (Nia Long), and daughter go out of town with the husband and daughter of a family friend, leaving Clarence alone. Rell, who is much happier after taking care of Keanu, takes Clarence out to see a Liam Neeson movie, telling him he needs to loosen up and just be himself. When the two return to Rells house, they find the place has been ransacked and Keanu is missing. A distraught Rell drags Clarence along to the next-door residence of his weed dealer Hulka (Will Forte), who reluctantly reveals that the 17th St. Blips, a local gang, may have raided Rells house instead of his. Hulka directs them to a downtown strip club; Rell and Clarence go there, where Rell convinces Clarence to adopt a ""gangsta"" persona in order to infiltrate the gang, calling themselves ""Tectonic"" and ""Shark Tank"". The two meet Hi-C (Tiffany Haddish), who initially is skeptical of them, but nonetheless takes them to meet the gangs leader Cheddar (Method Man), who mistakes them for the Allentown Boys. Cheddar has Keanu (having renamed him New Jack and fitted him with a do-rag), and they ask for the cat. He will only return the cat to them if they come along as expert advisors for the Blips on a run to sell a new drug called ""Holy Shit""; both reluctantly agree.After taking their team through a team-building exercise, Rell, Clarence, Hi-C, and three other gang members drive to their delivery spot. While Clarence stays behind and introduces the young men to the music of George Michael (whom he describes as if he were black, to overcome their skepticism), Rell and Hi-C go to make the sale. The buyer turns out to be Anna Faris, who is partying with two friends. Faris invites them to play Truth or Dare, and dares Hi-C to shoot Rell. When Hi-C refuses, a fight ensues in which Faris and her two guests are both shot and killed by Hi-C, frightening Rell. At the strip club after the run, Clarence accidentally smokes some Holy Shit, and experiences a drug trip in which he appears in the music video for ""Faith"" by George Michael, and Keanu speaks to him in the voice of Keanu Reeves. Rell begins to worry about his cousin and convinces him to just take Keanu and leave. The two do so, but are abducted on their way to their car by the actual Allentown Boys.Rell and Clarence are tied to chairs and as the Allentown Boys prepare to torture them, Keanu claws through Rells ropes, allowing him to free himself and Clarence, and they grab the Allentown Boys guns. The Allentown boys continue to approach them, but Clarence and Rell completely unload the guns into them, seemingly killing them. On their way out of the building searching for Keanu, Rell and Clarence run into the Blips; Cheddar has discovered their real identities when they refuse to shoot a kidnapped Hulka, and forces them to come along to a meeting with the Mexican drug cartel at its mansion in the morning. At the meeting, the Blips meet with King Diazs cousin Bacon (Luis Guzmán), offering Clarence and Rell as the supposed Allentown Boys, but when Bacon also demands ""Iglesias"", Cheddar refuses and starts a gunfight between the two gangs. Clarence and Rell realize that the team-building exercise the two took the gang through has improved their communication; they pick up guns and shoot their way out of the mansion in pursuit of Bacon, who has taken Keanu, only for Rell to be shot in the leg and Clarence shot in the hand.Rell – who never learned to drive – hijacks Bacons escape car with Bacon and Keanu in the back; Clarence gives chase in a car that belongs to Bacons son. The chase ends at Clarences house, where Rell crashes into the front yard, sending Bacon flying through where the windshield of the car would have been, had it not been removed in the chase. Bacon gets up and attempts to shoot Rell, but Clarence runs him over. Bacon gets up again, but is shot and killed by Cheddar and the Blips. The Blips threaten Rell and Clarence, but Hi-C – secretly a police officer – breaks her cover and forces the Blips to drop their guns. When Cheddar attempts to shoot her, she kills him. The police arrive, and Hi-C reveals that Faris and her party guests were in on the whole operation and are all still alive, but Rell and Clarence will still have to go to jail for the activities theyve taken part in, including the killing of the Allentown Boys. She promises to testify for leniency and agrees to go on a date with Rell after they get out of jail.Six months later, Rell and Clarence have only three weeks left on their jail sentences, but have commanded respect among the inmates – including the remaining Blips – for killing the Allentown Boys. Hi-C, who has been taking care of Keanu, speaks with Rell through a visitation phone, where she reveals that shes just been to the veterinarian and discovered that Keanu has a rare disease: he will remain a kitten permanently.In a post-credits scene, the Allentown Boys are revealed to have survived the shooting and get back into their car.",15000000,"[{""id"": 28, ""name"": ""Action""}, {""id"": 35, ""name"": ""Comedy""}]",http://keanumovie.com/,342521,"[{""id"": 2708, ""name"": ""hitman""}, {""id"": 3688, ""name"": ""strip club""}, {""id"": 12532, ""name"": ""african american""}, {""id"": 13142, ""name"": ""gangster""}, {""id"": 15483, ""name"": ""car chase""}, {""id"": 156143, ""name"": ""kitten""}, {""id"": 167541, ""name"": ""buddy comedy""}, {""id"": 208009, ""name"": ""gun fight""}, {""id"": 227198, ""name"": ""stolen pet""}, {""id"": 227201, ""name"": ""designer drug""}]",en,Friends hatch a plot to retrieve a stolen cat by posing as drug dealers for a street gang.,18.268009,"[{""name"": ""New Line Cinema"", ""id"": 12}]","[{""iso_3166_1"": ""US"", ""name"": ""United States of America""}]",4/21/2016,20566327,94,"[{""iso_639_1"": ""en"", ""name"": ""English""}]",Released,"Kitten, please.",Keanu,6,421,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0,0,0,0,1.371088467

365,366,Killer Joe,2012,/wiki/Killer_Joe_(film),"In West Dallas, Texas, 22-year-old drug dealer Chris Smith comes to the house of his father Ansel and step-mother Sharla, after his mother, Adele, threw him out of her house. To make matters worse, Adele stole his cocaine money and spent it on fixing her car, and now Chris is desperate to pay off his debt to his dealer, Digger Soames, so he decides to murder his mother to collect the $50,000 life insurance of which his 20 year old sister Dottie is the sole beneficiary. Assuming Dottie would share the money with Chris and their father, Chris manages to rope the dim-witted Ansel into hiring Joe Cooper, a police detective who has a side career as a contract killer, to kill Adele (Ansels ex-wife) to get the money. Chris and Ansel decide that after paying Joe from the proceeds of the life insurance policy, they will split the remainder four ways between themselves, Dottie, and Ansels wife Sharla. Dottie hears the plan as they are talking, and agrees that its a good idea.The plan almost fails when Joe demands all of the money in advance, which of course Chris and Ansel do not have. However, Joe is interested in the odd, childlike Dottie and offers to take her as a ""retainer"" until the insurance comes through. Through Dotties interaction with Joe, it is revealed that Adele tried to kill Dottie once when she was an infant. Joe ""dates"" Dottie and then appears to be staying over at their home and having sex with her regularly. Chris has a change of heart and asks him to call off the hit, only to discover that Joe has already killed Adele. With Chris reluctant help, Joe hides the body in a car and torches it.After Adeles death is discovered, the family learns that the insurance beneficiary is actually Rex, Adeles boyfriend, rather than her daughter Dottie.  Chris then admits he originally heard the details about the policy from Rex, who also told him about Joe. Ansel then realizes that Rex duped Chris into hiring Joe to kill Adele. Immediately afterwards, Chris tries to talk Dottie into running away with him to escape Digger, who has already had two of his goons severely beat Chris up for not having repaid him. Dottie says she will go with him, but she must see Joe again first.After Ansel and Sharla return home from Adeles funeral, they find Joe inside with Dottie. He comes out of her room and asks increasingly pointed questions of Sharla, which ultimately leads her to admit that she knew the policy was really $100,000 (accidental death is double).  Joe shows them a check of that amount payable to Rex, as well as incriminating photos which prove Sharla was having an affair with Rex. Angered, Ansel declines to protect Sharla when Joe punches her and forces her to simulate oral sex on a fried chicken drumstick.Joe knows Chris is coming to take Dottie away and he threatens to kill Ansel and Sharla if they dont stop him. After Chris is seated for dinner, Joe announces that he and Dottie will be married. Chris refuses to let them, ordering Dottie to leave with him; Joe tells her to stay where she is. For a moment Dottie sits there, then she gets up and turns and, while the men yell out at her, Chris threatens Joe with a gun and the two struggle. Ansel and Sharla jump in to assist Joe as he brutally beats Chris, not wanting to be killed by Joe if Chris flees with Dottie. In all the confusion, Dottie recovers the gun and, in a rage, she fires several shots, killing Chris and seriously wounding Ansel. Dottie turns the gun on Joe, telling him that she is pregnant. Joe appears overjoyed as he inches closer to Dottie. The film ends just as Dottie moves her finger back on the trigger.",10000000,"[{""id"": 80, ""name"": ""Crime""}, {""id"": 18, ""name"": ""Drama""}, {""id"": 53, ""name"": ""Thriller""}]",http://killerjoethemovie.com/,73567,"[{""id"": 900, ""name"": ""trailer park""}, {""id"": 1419, ""name"": ""gun""}, {""id"": 1556, ""name"": ""texas""}, {""id"": 5011, ""name"": ""deal""}, {""id"": 6259, ""name"": ""psychopath""}, {""id"": 10427, ""name"": ""sexual humiliation""}, {""id"": 10594, ""name"": ""money""}, {""id"": 10968, ""name"": ""lingerie""}, {""id"": 11363, ""name"": ""arson""}, {""id"": 15167, ""name"": ""police detective""}, {""id"": 155794, ""name"": ""physical abuse""}, {""id"": 207268, ""name"": ""neo-noir""}, {""id"": 208518, ""name"": ""burial""}, {""id"": 220628, ""name"": ""pizza shop""}, {""id"": 237851, ""name"": ""drugs""}]",en,A cop (Matthew McConaughey) who moonlights as a hit man agrees to kill the hated mother of a desperate drug dealer (Emile Hirsch) in exchange for a tumble with the young man's virginal sister (Juno Temple).,16.436178,"[{""name"": ""Voltage pictures"", ""id"": 6633}, {""name"": ""Worldview Entertainment"", ""id"": 9015}, {""name"": ""ANA Media"", ""id"": 21817}, {""name"": ""Picture Perfect (I)"", ""id"": 37833}]","[{""iso_3166_1"": ""US"", ""name"": ""United States of America""}]",9/10/2011,3665069,102,"[{""iso_639_1"": ""en"", ""name"": ""English""}]",Released,A Totally Deep-Fried Texas Redneck Trailer Park Murder Story.,Killer Joe,6.5,425,0.5,0.5,0.203150004,0.5,-0.296849996,0.296849996,0,0.197899997,0.3665069
366,367,Killers,2010,/wiki/Killers_(2010_film),"After a break-up with a boyfriend, an overcautious Jen (Katherine Heigl) travels to Nice, France, with her parents (Tom Selleck and Catherine OHara). After getting into an elevator to go to her hotel room, she meets Spencer Aimes (Ashton Kutcher). Spencer asks her out for drinks, and she accepts. The scene then changes to Spencer sneaking onto a boat, putting a remote controlled bomb on the bottom of a helicopter, then taking out a guard. He then swims back and goes on the date with Jen.  After the helicopter takes off, Spencer triggers the bomb using his phone.After a night of drinking, Jen reveals that she is not the spontaneous person shes been pretending to be and, in return, Spencer bluntly tells her that hes an assassin, albeit unhappy about being one. Unfortunately, shes already passed out and hasnt heard. In spite of this, Spencer decides that Jens the woman hes been looking for and decides to marry her. When Spencer tells his boss, Holbrook (Martin Mull), his plan, the response is that quitting is not an option. Spencer is defiant and goes ahead with his plan.Three years later, they are settled into their new normal life. After Spencer surprises Jen with a remodeled office, she gives him a birthday surprise: tickets to Nice to celebrate his birthday and their three years. Because of his dubious connections to Nice, Spencer is less than enthusiastic. When Jens friends ask about his reaction, they take it as a sign that he might be getting bored and fill her head with doubts.Meanwhile, Spencer gets a postcard from his old boss and the ultimatum to take another assignment. While trying to refuse him long distance, Jens father shows up to take Spencer to dinner, so Spencer hangs up the phone, prompting suspicion in Mr. Kornfeldt. This is fueled further when Jens dad sees the postcard and quizzes him about the XOXX (hugs and kisses), being odd coming from a former boss. Stopping home to change, Spencer finds that the dinner invitation is just a detour to bring him to a surprise party. While Spencer navigates drunken friends, Jens friends continue to fill her head with doubts over Spencers lack of enthusiasm for the Nice trip. This is further irritated, when the following morning, despite her attempts to be physical with him, Spencer rushes Jen off on her business trip.A little while later, Jen comes back (without having gone on her trip) to find Spencer being tossed around their house by Henry (Rob Riggle), Spencers best friend and co-worker. Spencer screams for her to get his gun (of which she was unaware) and she shoots Henry in the arm. While interrogating him, Henry reveals that there is a $20 million bounty on Spencers head. An unidentified sniper takes shots at them, and Spencer and Jen flee.  Henry goes after them; and, after a car chase through the neighborhood, they end up in a construction zone, where Henry crashes his car.  Spencer rams him into a trench, impaling his car on rebar and killing him.  They then go to the hotel room where Spencers old boss is staying but find that someone has already killed him. Jen demands that they go to her Dad for help, but Spencer disagrees. In the middle of their argument Jen vomits and declares that she might be pregnant.Heading back to his office for Jen to take a pregnancy test, Spencer is attacked by his secretary (Katheryn Winnick) and realizes that there are others who know about the contract. Jen then reveals that she is pregnant and is leaving Spencer. Left alone, Spencer is attacked by a delivery driver, who is then run over and killed by Olivia (Lisa Ann Walter), Henrys wife, another killer vying for the contract. She then tries to run over Spencer, but Jen returns and smashes Olivias car into a fuel tank, which Spencer then shoots at and explodes, killing Olivia. The two discuss their possible future and return to their neighborhood, which is holding its annual block party. When they first arrive, they are attacked by two more assailants who, in a chase through backyards, crash their car, giving Jen and Spencer a chance to flee into the block party. As they walk through it, they receive many suspicious looks from neighbors. They enter their house to retrieve guns and their passports. Spencer is grabbing the guns when he is attacked by the two assailants again, whom he eventually kills.Meanwhile, one assassin, Kristen (Casey Wilson), one of Jens best friends, holds Jens mother as a hostage in a Mexican standoff with Jen. Jens father arrives and kills Kristen. He then explains that he was the one who put out the bounty on Spencer. He knew of Spencers previous work all along, and hired the neighbors and co-workers three years before, in case Spencer started working for his old boss again, who Jens father says had ""gone dirty."" After seeing the postcard from Holbrook in Spencers office, he came to the conclusion that Spencer had re-accepted his old job and activated the assassins. He reveals that he had been an operative as well, and that he was actually the target Spencer was supposed to kill in Nice three years earlier.In a standoff between Spencer and Jens father, he does not trust that Spencer is really out of the game.  Wanting to prove that he really did get out, Spencer drops his gun, and tells Jens father he has no intention of killing him. Jen, now convinced, reveals her pregnancy to her parents.  Jens father, after killing one last wounded assassin, drops his gun as well. The family makes peace by building a trust circle, in which Spencer reveals that English is not his first language, and that he wanted to be the first one to say ""I love you"" to Jen. The movie ends showing Spencer and Jens father working on some wires near Spencer and Jens babys crib. Spencer has grown a moustache just like Jens father. Spencer and Jen then leave to let Jens mom and dad babysit. They all leave the room, but Spencer comes back in to activate the lasers protecting the baby.",75000000,"[{""id"": 28, ""name"": ""Action""}, {""id"": 35, ""name"": ""Comedy""}, {""id"": 53, ""name"": ""Thriller""}, {""id"": 10749, ""name"": ""Romance""}]",http://killersfilm.com/,37821,"[{""id"": 782, ""name"": ""assassin""}]",en,"When an elite assassin marries a beautiful computer whiz after a whirlwind romance, he gives up the gun and settles down with his new bride.

367,368,Knight and Day,2010,/wiki/Knight_and_Day,"After colliding with Roy Miller (Tom Cruise) twice in the airport departure terminal on the way home from Wichita to pick up car parts, June Havens (Cameron Diaz) is told she has been bumped to a later flight. CIA Agent John Fitzgerald (Peter Sarsgaard), believing Havens is working with Miller, puts her back on the plane. Completely taken with Miller, Havens goes to the restroom to prep herself. Meanwhile, Miller fights and kills everyone else on the plane, even the pilots, who were all agents sent by Fitzgerald. After Havens reemerges and gives him a kiss, Miller crash-lands the plane in a cornfield. He drugs a shocked and confused Havens, warning her about the agents who will come after her and that she is not safe with them.Waking up at home, Havens struggles through a day fitting a bridesmaids dress for her sisters (Maggie Grace) wedding, and is shocked to learn her sister would like to sell their fathers 1966 Pontiac GTO tri-power, which Havens had planned on finishing as a wedding present. Havens is then picked up by a group of intelligence agents, led by Fitzgerald. Miller arrives and, through a long gunfight on the highway, kills several agents and reclaims Havens. She flees at the first opportunity and contacts Rodney (Marc Blucas), a firefighter and former boyfriend. Believing Havens is merely stressed and is playing out a fantasy, Rodney takes her out; she tells him everything that has happened to her, though he still does not understand. Miller then arrives and pretends to take Havens hostage while holding everyone else at gunpoint, fleeing with her.Miller explains that Havens is safer with him and she agrees to follow him as they go to pick up Simon Feck (Paul Dano), a genius inventor who has created a perpetual energy battery called the Zephyr. Traveling to Brooklyn, Miller and Havens discover that Feck has fled from the warehouse he was hiding in, leaving a clue for Miller about his location. They are then attacked by henchmen sent by Spanish arms dealer, Antonio Quintana (Jordi Mollà). After again being drugged, Havens drifts in and out of consciousness between their capture and escape from Quintanas men. Miller brings her to an island that is off-the-grid, which he uses as a safe house. Accepting a call from her sister after leaving in frustration, Havens accidentally leads Quintanas men straight to the hideaway. They try to kill Miller and Havens with an unmanned aerial vehicle. Before they escape by helicopter, Havens is knocked-out by Miller, since she is afraid of flying.Miller reunites with Feck and they, with Havens, get on a train heading for Austria. Havens is attacked by Bernard (Falk Hentschel), an assassin sent by Quintana to retrieve the Zephyr and Feck, and kill Miller. But Miller and Havens fight him and he is killed. Arriving at Salzburg, the three check into a hotel. Miller later leaves to meet with Naomi (Gal Gadot), Quintanas henchwoman, to make a deal. Havens follows him and listens to Millers conversation, misunderstanding that he does not care for her. Havens is picked up by Fitzgerald and C.I.A. Director Isabel George (Viola Davis), who tell her that Miller was using her at the airport to smuggle in the Zephyr when they bumped into each other; they convince her that he doesnt love her. They also tell her that Miller is the traitor and plans to trade the battery with Quintana. Heartbroken, Havens allows the C.I.A. to find Miller back at the hotel. Miller escapes with the battery, but is seemingly shot on the rooftop and falls to his death in the river. Feck is taken into custody afterwards to Schwedelbach, Germany, though it is later revealed that Fitzgerald has been the real traitor all along and he captures Feck.Returning home, Havens heads to an address she remembered from Millers iPhone, where she finds his parents and learns that his real name is Matthew Knight. They believe their son, a former Army sergeant and Eagle Scout, is dead; but they are fabulously wealthy from winning lotteries and sweepstakes they dont remember entering. Leaving a message on her own answering machine that she has the Zephyr, she is captured by Quintanas men and taken to Sevilla, Spain. She is drugged with a prototype truth serum before being rescued by Miller, who was tracking Fitzgerald, who was delivering Feck to Quintana.Chaos erupts throughout the streets and Quintana is killed by a bull stampede. At the docks, Miller saves Feck from a bullet wound after handing over the Zephyr in a small pouch. Feck later reveals that the battery is unstable and it explodes, killing Fitzgerald. Miller collapses from the gunshot and is hospitalized in Washington D.C.. George apologizes to Miller about the antagonism between him and Fitzgerald, but tells him to let go of Havens and return to the C.I.A., however, she uses euphemisms that imply he will be killed by the agency the next day, saying he “will be safe” and “he will be transferred to a secure location” (code language revealed to Havens earlier in the film that means a person will be killed). Miller realizes that the agency will not risk him possibly going rogue again and will likely kill him to prevent it. Shortly after George leaves the room, the nurse in the room, who heard the coded language, drugs Miller; the nurse is Havens. After Havens breaks Miller out of the hospital, he wakes up in the rebuilt GTO that belonged to her father. After Miller asks what day it is, Havens kisses him and says it is someday, a reference to the start of the film, where they both say that they have things they want to do someday. Havens begins to drive towards Cape Horn. As the credits begin to roll, Millers parents unexpectedly receive tickets to Cape Horn in the mail and decide to go.",117000000,"[{""id"": 28, ""name"": ""Action""}, {""id"": 35, ""name"": ""Comedy""}]",http://www.knightanddaymovie.com,37834,"[{""id"": 470, ""name"": ""spy""}, {""id"": 822, ""name"": ""airport""}, {""id"": 1420, ""name"": ""gas station""}, {""id"": 2101, ""name"": ""garage""}, {""id"": 3203, ""name"": ""pilot""}, {""id"": 3713, ""name"": ""chase""}, {""id"": 4289, ""name"": ""secret agent""}, {""id"": 6399, ""name"": ""rope""}, {""id"": 9778, ""name"": ""exploding building""}, {""id"": 15483, ""name"": ""car chase""}, {""id"": 33352, ""name"": ""police car""}, {""id"": 33353, ""name"": ""boy genius""}, {""id"": 179431, ""name"": ""duringcreditsstinger""}]",en,"A fugitive couple goes on a glamorous and sometimes deadly adventure where nothing and no one – even themselves – are what they seem.

368,369,Kung Fu Panda,2011,/wiki/Kung_Fu_Panda,"In the Valley of Peace, a land in ancient China inhabited by anthropomorphic animals, Po, a gluttonous giant panda, is a kung fu fanatic who idolizes the Furious Five (Tigress, Monkey, Mantis, Viper, and Crane), a quintet of kung fu students trained by the red panda Master Shifu at the Jade Palace. However, as he helps his adoptive goose father Mr. Ping in his noodle restaurant, Po is unable to pursue his dream of becoming a kung fu master himself.Grand Master Oogway, a sage old tortoise and Shifus mentor, has a vision that Shifus former student, the corrupted snow leopard Tai Lung, will escape from prison and return to the Valley of Peace to exact his revenge. Panicked, Shifu sends his messenger, Zeng the goose, with a request for the prison to tighten the security in order to prevent Tai Lungs escape. He then holds a tournament for the Furious Five so that Oogway can identify the Dragon Warrior, the one kung fu master worthy of the Dragon Scroll, which is said to hold the secret to boundless power. Po fails to arrive at the arena before the doors are closed. Desperate to see the Dragon Warrior, Po straps himself to a set of fireworks, rockets into the sky and crashes into the arena. He opens his eyes to see Oogway pointing his finger at him. Much to the shock of everyone there (including Po), Oogway proclaims Po as the Dragon Warrior.Unwilling to accept Oogways decision, Shifu tries to dispose of Po with an excruciatingly harsh training regime bordering on torture coupled with constant belittlement of his physique and personality. Following in Shifus footsteps, the Furious Five similarly berate and mock Po as simply an enthusiast with no potential in the martial art. Po considers resigning, but after receiving encouragement from Oogway, he endures his training and slowly begins to befriend the Five with his culinary skill, resilience, and good humor, though Tigress remains reluctant to accept him as the Dragon Warrior.Tigress tells Po the story of Shifu and Tai Lung. Long ago, Shifu found the infant Tai Lung on the steps of the palace. He brought up Tai Lung as his son and taught him kung fu. Although Tai Lung was a proficient kung fu practitioner, Oogway sensed corruption within him and refused to give him the Dragon Scroll. Enraged, Tai Lung attacked the valley and tried to take the scroll by force, but Oogway stopped him and locked him in prison. Shifu, filled with guilt and sorrow over his sons betrayal, became cold and distant to his later students. Meanwhile, Tai Lung escapes from prison as foreseen by Oogway, ironically picking his locks with Zengs fallen feather and killing the guards. Shifu learns of Tai Lungs escape from Zeng and informs Oogway, who extracts a promise from Shifu to believe in Po, and then passes on to the heavens in a stream of peach blossoms. Still unable to grasp the basics of kung fu, Po despairingly admits that he has no chance of defeating Tai Lung. However, Shifu discovers that Po is capable of impressive physical feats when motivated by food, and takes advantage of this in order to successfully train Po by incorporating these feats into an effective kung fu style.Meanwhile, the Furious Five set out to stop Tai Lung themselves, only to be defeated by his nerve strikes. Following their return, Shifu decides that Po is ready to receive the Dragon Scroll, but the scroll reveals nothing but a blank reflective surface. Unable to understand the message of the scroll, Shifu orders Po and the Five to evacuate the valley while he faces Tai Lung, knowing that he will most likely forfeit his life. As Tai Lung arrives and fights Shifu, a distraught Po finds Mr. Ping. In an attempt to console his son, Mr. Ping reveals that the secret ingredient to his famous ""secret ingredient soup"" is ""nothing"" (explaining that ""to make something special, you just have to believe it is""). Po realizes that this is the message of the Dragon Scroll and goes back to confront Tai Lung.Po becomes a formidable challenge for Tai Lung, frustrating him with confusing fighting techniques on top of his excessive body fat that renders him immune to Tai Lungs nerve strikes. Tai Lung momentarily bests Po and retrieves the scroll, but he is unable to understand it. When Po explains to Tai Lung that the true secret to becoming the Dragon Warrior is to just believe in yourself, he refuses to accept it and continues attacking Po. Eventually, Po defeats Tai Lung in combat before using the mysterious Wuxi Finger Hold to vanquish him. Po is praised by the Valley of Peace and earns the respect of the Furious Five, who fully acknowledge him as a true kung fu master. Po then finds Shifu, who finally attains inner peace, now that the valley is safe once more.In a post-credits scene, Po and Shifu share a meal of dumplings together under Oogways peach tree, the seed Shifu planted beside it earlier beginning to blossom.",130000000,"[{""id"": 12, ""name"": ""Adventure""}, {""id"": 16, ""name"": ""Animation""}, {""id"": 10751, ""name"": ""Family""}, {""id"": 35, ""name"": ""Comedy""}]",http://www.kungfupanda.com/,9502,"[{""id"": 478, ""name"": ""china""}, {""id"": 779, ""name"": ""martial arts""}, {""id"": 780, ""name"": ""kung fu""}, {""id"": 1310, ""name"": ""mentor""}, {""id"": 1585, ""name"": ""snake""}, {""id"": 1946, ""name"": ""restaurant""}, {""id"": 1998, ""name"": ""shop""}, {""id"": 2660, ""name"": ""strong woman""}, {""id"": 3930, ""name"": ""bravery""}, {""id"": 4809, ""name"": ""tiger""}, {""id"": 6362, ""name"": ""turtle""}, {""id"": 8531, ""name"": ""panda""}, {""id"": 9362, ""name"": ""sensei""}, {""id"": 11500, ""name"": ""anthropomorphism""}, {""id"": 14955, ""name"": ""fighting""}, {""id"": 15036, ""name"": ""ancient china""}, {""id"": 15149, ""name"": ""monkey""}, {""id"": 33401, ""name"": ""master""}, {""id"": 40850, ""name"": ""destiny""}, {""id"": 156075, ""name"": ""evil""}, {""id"": 179430, ""name"": ""aftercreditsstinger""}, {""id"": 185319, ""name"": ""monkey warrior""}, {""id"": 193046, ""name"": ""noodle""}]",en,"When the Valley of Peace is threatened, lazy Po the panda discovers his destiny as the ""chosen one"" and trains to become a kung fu hero, but transforming the unsleek slacker into a brave warrior won't be easy.

After discovering from the courts goat soothsayer that ""a warrior of black-and-white"" will defeat him if he does not change his ways, Shen leads an army of wolves to exterminate the panda population to avert the prophecy. Shens parents are horrified by this atrocity and disown their son and exile him, who swears revenge.Thirty years later, Po is living his dream as the Dragon Warrior, protecting the Valley of Peace alongside his friends and fellow kung fu masters, the Furious Five. However, his teacher Shifu tells him that he has yet to achieve inner peace. While defending a village from wolf bandits who have been stealing refined metal for Shen, Po is distracted by a symbol on their leaders armor, which causes him to have a flashback of his mother and allows the wolves to escape. Po asks his goose father, Mr. Ping, about his origins. Ping reveals that he found Po as an infant in a radish crate and adopted him, but Po remains unsatisfied, wondering how and why he ended up in the Valley of Peace.Shifu receives word that Shen has returned to Gongmen City and killed Thundering Rhino, the leader of the kung fu council protecting the City, and is plotting to conquer China with his newly developed cannon, forged with the metal the wolves stole. Shifu sends Po and the Furious Five to Gongmen City to stop Shen and destroy his weapon. They find the city occupied by Shens forces, with the two surviving council members Storming Ox and Croc imprisoned. The heroes ask the council members for help to liberate the city, but the two cite their helplessness against Shens weapon and refuse. Po and the Five are discovered by the wolf boss and give chase, only to be arrested in front of Shens tower.Upon being brought before Shen in his tower, Po and the Five escape and destroy Shens weapon. However, Po is again distracted by a flashback upon seeing the same symbol as before on Shens plumage, realizing Shen was there the last night Po saw his parents. This allows Shen to escape and destroy the tower with an arsenal of cannons.

370,371,Kung Fu Panda 2,2011,/wiki/Kung_Fu_Panda_2,"Lord Shen, the scion of a peacock clan that rules Gongmen City in ancient China, seeks to weaponize gunpowder, which had recently been invented to create fireworks. After discovering from the courts goat soothsayer that ""a warrior of black-and-white"" will defeat him if he does not change his ways, Shen leads an army of wolves to exterminate the panda population to avert the prophecy. Shens parents are horrified by this atrocity and disown their son and exile him, who swears revenge.Thirty years later, Po is living his dream as the Dragon Warrior, protecting the Valley of Peace alongside his friends and fellow kung fu masters, the Furious Five. However, his teacher Shifu tells him that he has yet to achieve inner peace. While defending a village from wolf bandits who have been stealing refined metal for Shen, Po is distracted by a symbol on their leaders armor, which causes him to have a flashback of his mother and allows the wolves to escape. Po asks his goose father, Mr. Ping, about his origins. Ping reveals that he found Po as an infant in a radish crate and adopted him, but Po remains unsatisfied, wondering how and why he ended up in the Valley of Peace.Shifu receives word that Shen has returned to Gongmen City and killed Thundering Rhino, the leader of the kung fu council protecting the City, and is plotting to conquer China with his newly developed cannon, forged with the metal the wolves stole. Shifu sends Po and the Furious Five to Gongmen City to stop Shen and destroy his weapon. They find the city occupied by Shens forces, with the two surviving council members Storming Ox and Croc imprisoned. The heroes ask the council members for help to liberate the city, but the two cite their helplessness against Shens weapon and refuse. Po and the Five are discovered by the wolf boss and give chase, only to be arrested in front of Shens tower.Upon being brought before Shen in his tower, Po and the Five escape and destroy Shens weapon. However, Po is again distracted by a flashback upon seeing the same symbol as before on Shens plumage, realizing Shen was there the last night Po saw his parents. This allows Shen to escape and destroy the tower with an arsenal of cannons.

371,372,Kung Fu Panda 3,2016,/wiki/Kung_Fu_Panda_3,"In the spirit realm, Oogway fights against a bull adversary named Kai, who has defeated all the other kung fu masters in the realm and taken their chi. Oogway too is ensnared and has his chi stolen, but warns Kai that the Dragon Warrior, Po, will stop him. Kai takes this as a challenge to steal the Dragon Warriors chi and returns to the mortal realm.Meanwhile, Master Shifu announces his retirement from teaching and passes the role of teacher to Po. An initially excited Po realizes that teaching kung fu is not as easy as anticipated, and the Furious Five are injured as a result. Po is demoralized because of his failure, but Shifu advises Po that instead of trying to be a teacher, he should try to be himself. Po returns home where he meets a panda, Li Shan, whom they both realize is his long-lost biological father. They quickly bond with each other, much to the jealousy of Pos adoptive father, Mr. Ping.After introducing Li to Shifu and his friends, Po and the Five defend the Valley of Peace from jade zombies that Kai has created from the chi of past kung fu masters. The team learns through research that Oogway and Kai were once brothers-in-arms. After Oogway was injured in battle, Kai carried him to a village of pandas who healed him with their mastery of chi. The pandas then taught Oogway how to utilize chi to help others. However, Kai wanted the power for himself and tried to steal the pandas chi, forcing Oogway to banish him to the spirit realm. In order to defeat Kai, Po must learn to master the use of chi himself. Li offers to teach him by taking him to his secret panda village. Po and Li travel to the village while Shifu and the Furious Five stay behind to deal with Kai; Mr. Ping follows the pandas, worried that he will lose Pos affections to Li. Although Po is eager to learn chi, Li tells him he must first learn the relaxed life of a panda in the village. They travel to the village with Mr. Ping as a stowaway.Kai takes the chi of nearly every kung fu master in China, including Shifu and the Furious Five, except Tigress, who warns the pandas of Kais intentions, and Po. Afraid, Li and the pandas prepare to run away. When Po demands that Li teach him how to use chi, Li confesses that he does not know how, and that he lied out of fear of losing his son again. Po is hurt over his fathers misdirection and isolates himself to train vigorously in preparation for fighting Kai; Mr. Ping, who realizes Po has become happier with Li in his life, encourages Li and the other pandas to stay and ask Po to train them so they can fight back. Tigress confronts Po and tells him that he has no other way of defeating Kai. Realizing what had previously made him fail as a teacher, Po agrees and teaches them to use their everyday activities as kung fu skills.Kai arrives and sends his minions to capture Po, who sets the pandas, Ping, and Tigress upon them, distracting Kai. They defeat the jade zombie army, but when Po tries to use his signature Wuxi Finger Hold on Kai to send him back to the spirit realm, Kai reveals that it only works on mortals, not a spirit warrior like himself. Kai gains the upper hand in their fight, but Po uses the Wuxi Finger Hold on himself while gripping Kai around the neck, transporting them both to the spirit realm. They fight again, and Kai subdues Po and begins to steal his chi. Using what they learned from Po, his friends and family use their chi to empower him. Po harnesses their chi to create a giant dragon figure with which he overloads Kai, killing him and restoring all of the fallen masters to normal.In an ethereal golden pond, Oogway appears to Po and informs him that his journey as the Dragon Warrior has come full circle, declaring Po to be his successor. He reveals that he sent Li to find Po. By choice, Po wields a mystic jade yin-yang staff bestowed by Oogway to return to the mortal world.

Larry, who is divorced and lives alone, cannot find a job and could lose his house. Larrys neighbor, Lamar, advises him to enroll at East Valley Community College and get an education.Subsisting on unemployment benefits and unable to afford to drive his SUV, Larry buys a scooter from Lamar. At the college, he becomes part of a colorful community of outcasts, also-rans, and the overlooked all trying to find a better future for themselves.  Two of the classes he takes are speech, taught by Mercedes Tainot and economics, taught by Dr. Ed Matsutani.  While he initially struggles in speech class, he does very well in economics.Mercedes drinks at home after school because she is unhappily married to Dean, a former professor-turned-writer-turned-blogger.  In reality, Dean spends his days looking at internet porn.Larrys economics classmate Talia invites him to join a club of scooter riders led by her boyfriend Dell Gordo. She also updates Larrys home decor, hair style, and wardrobe. Larrys friend Frank, who runs the diner, offers him a job to help make ends meet, as Larry had been a Navy cook.After a night with Dean goes horribly wrong, Mercedes is left alone at a bus stop, where Larry and his scooter gang notice her.  Larry offers her a ride home, which Mercedes reluctantly accepts.  On their way home they witness Dean getting arrested for drunk driving. At her front door, Mercedes offers Larry to kiss her and they hug (Mercedes thinks that they are kissing). She wants to have sex as well, but Larry declines, not wanting to take advantage of her inebriated state.  When Dean arrives home the following morning he finds all of his possessions on the front lawn.Realizing there is no way he will not lose his house, Larry uses the knowledge he gained in his Economics class to begin a strategic foreclosure. Mercedes, meanwhile, warns Larry not to disclose the events of the previous night, and remains under the false impression that he is romantically involved with the much-younger Talia. It disappoints Larry, who had been excited about Mercedes interest in him. He goes back to concentrating on his studies and his new job instead.Mercedes runs into Talia, who is telling Frances, her English teacher, that she will be dropping out of college to start a thrift store. Mercedes finds out that Talia and Larry are just friends.  Later, Frances comes over to Mercedes apartment to provide emotional support due to her divorcing Dean.Finals now come, and Larry is scheduled last.

She lets him know that he was an excellent student, to which he replies that she was an excellent teacher.  When the next term begins, some of the students from Mercedes speech course register for her Shakespeare class, but Larry is not with them.

373,374,Leap Year,2010,/wiki/Leap_Year_(2010_film),"Successful real estate stager Anna Brady (Amy Adams) is frustrated that her cardiologist boyfriend Jeremy Sloane (Adam Scott) still has not proposed to her after four years. She decides to travel from Boston to Dublin, to propose to him on February 29, leap day, while he is there at a conference. Anna wishes to invoke an Irish tradition that a man who is proposed to on leap day must accept the proposal. During the flight, a storm diverts the plane to Wales, where Anna hires a boat to take her to Cork. The severity of the storm, however, forces her to be put ashore at a small seaside village called Dingle, where she makes her way to a local tavern. Anna tries to enlist the help of Declan OCallaghan (Matthew Goode), the surly Irish innkeeper. She requests him to taxi her across the country to Dublin. At first he refuses, but after his tavern is threatened with foreclosure, he agrees to drive her for €500. The two set out in his old beat-up car. Along the way, he makes fun of her fancy Louis Vuitton luggage, which he calls ""Louie"". He also mocks her belief in a leap year ""tradition"" of women proposing to men.Their travel is interrupted by a herd of cows blocking the road. Anna steps in cow-dung while attempting to move the animals, and tries to clean her expensive shoes while leaning on Declans car which causes it to roll downhill into a stream. Continuing on foot, Anna flags down a van with three travellers who offer her a lift. Ignoring Declans warning, Anna accepts the ride and hands them her luggage. Before she can enter the van, they drive off without her. Anna and Declan eventually make their way on foot to a roadside pub, where they discover the three van thieves going through Annas luggage. Declan fights them, displaying unexpected strength for a man of his size, and retrieves Annas bag. Anna and Declan are ejected from the pub by the owner for fighting on the premises.Anna and Declan reach a railway station and decide to wait for the next train. While waiting, they hike up a hill to the ruins of a nearby castle. They ask each other what they would grab if their homes were on fire and they had only 60 seconds to flee. In doing so, Declan also tells her of an old Irish legend about a young woman promised to an elderly lord that she did not love. So she gave her wedding guests a sleeping potion so she could run away with the man she does love. The legend told is loosely based on ""The Pursuit of Diarmuid and Gráinne"".  During the story they lose track of time and miss the train. That night they are forced to stay at a local bed & breakfast at Tipperary, where they pretend to be married, taking the name ""OBrady-Callaghan"" so that their conservative hosts will allow them to stay. During dinner, when other couples kiss to show their love for each other, Anna and Declan are ""forced"" to kiss as well. This stirs feelings that neither had expected. That night, they sleep in the same bed, but do not admit their new feelings for each other.The next day while hitch-hiking down the road, Anna and Declan are caught in a hail-storm and take shelter in a nearby church, where a wedding is taking place. They are invited to the reception. But during the reception, Anna drinks too much. Anna begins to question her own intentions with Jeremy and realizes that she has feelings for Declan. Just as the two are about to kiss, Anna vomits and passes out. The following day they arrive in Dublin, as they make their way on foot from the bus terminal to the hotel, Declan reveals that he was once engaged but his fiancé ran off to Dublin with his mothers claddagh ring and his best friend. Anna suggests to him, now that he is in Dublin, that he should ask for his mothers ring back. When they arrive at the hotel where Jeremy is staying, Jeremy surprises Anna by proposing to her right in the lobby. Anna turns around to look at Declan just to see that he had already walked out of the hotel, and she accepts Jeremys proposal.At their engagement party in Boston, Anna learns that Jeremy decided to propose because he thought it was the only way to appease the co-op board of the apartment building the couple had wanted to move into at the beginning of the film. Dismayed, Anna pulls the fire alarm and waits, testing the 60-second concept she had discussed with Declan earlier. When the alarm sounds, Jeremys instinct is to retrieve all of their electronic materials such as mobile phones, laptops, etc and shows no concern for Annas well-being. At that moment, Anna fully realizes that there is nothing in the apartment that means anything to her, including Jeremy. Meanwhile, in Dublin, Declan retrieves his mothers claddagh ring from his ex-fiancé.Sometime later, Anna arrives back at Caraghs Tavern in Dingle, where Declan is running his seemingly successful business, having pulled together the balance he owed to his property owner with the help of the community. She reveals to him that she has broken off her engagement to Jeremy and tells Declan that she has come to believe that all she needs/wants is right in Dingle. When she proposes that they get together, ignoring her controlling nature and saying they should not make plans, Declan heads outside. Thinking that she had been rejected, Anna rushes outside and makes her way to the edge of a nearby cliff overlooking the sea. Declan emerges, revealing that he went out simply to retrieve his mothers claddagh ring so that he could give it to her. Taking her offer even further, Declan says he wants to make plans with her, and proposes on the cliffside. Anna happily accepts, and they are later seen in Declans car, leaving their destination open to fate.",19000000,"[{""id"": 10749, ""name"": ""Romance""}, {""id"": 35, ""name"": ""Comedy""}]",http://www.leapyearfilm.net,25195,"[{""id"": 444, ""name"": ""taxi""}, {""id"": 1010, ""name"": ""bar""}, {""id"": 1209, ""name"": ""wales""}, {""id"": 1459, ""name"": ""marriage proposal""}, {""id"": 3800, ""name"": ""airplane""}, {""id"": 5319, ""name"": ""pub""}, {""id"": 5543, ""name"": ""cow""}, {""id"": 7578, ""name"": ""wedding ring""}, {""id"": 13027, ""name"": ""wedding""}, {""id"": 14983, ""name"": ""proposal""}, {""id"": 14984, ""name"": ""cardiologist""}, {""id"": 14985, ""name"": ""ireland""}, {""id"": 14987, ""name"": ""cliffs""}]",en,"When yet another anniversary passes without a marriage proposal from her boyfriend, Anna decides to take action.

However, her mother Irene quickly calls to inform her that her father cannot make it. While at the airport waiting for him, Chloe meets up with investigative reporter Cameron ""Buck"" Williams.Rayford shows up on his way to a flight and apologizes to Chloe for missing his birthday party, insisting he was called in to pilot a flight to London at the last minute. He also assures Chloe things are fine between himself and his wife, who recently had become an active believing Christian, much to Chloes chagrin. Chloe suspects things are not fine between her father and mother – she had seen him flirting with flight attendant Hattie Durham and notices he has removed his wedding ring. Her suspicions soon are confirmed when an airport worker hands Chloe two hard-to-get U2 concert tickets in London that Rayford had ordered, indicating his trip to London and possible extramarital fling was planned all along.Chloe brushes off another one of her mothers preachings about Christianity and takes her brother to the mall. While there, her brother suddenly vanishes, leaving only his clothes behind. Chloe is shocked and notices this same thing has happened to numerous others at the mall. Mayhem breaks loose as shoppers begin looting the stores. A driver-less car plows through the mall windows, and a small plane without a pilot crashes in the mall parking lot. Chloe sees television reports of children and some adults disappearing, as worldwide panic sets in.On Rayfords flight, the same strange event has occurred – several people, including his co-pilot Chris Smith, Kimmy, one of the flight attendants, and all the children on board, have simply disappeared, leaving their clothing and personal effects behind. The remaining passengers panic and demand answers. Rayford does his best to reassure the passengers he will pass on information once he has any. Rayford has difficulty getting radio or satellite phone contact with anyone on the ground, until he is finally informed that people have disappeared everywhere and the world is in uproar. Soon a pilot-less jet approaches directly into Rayfords flight path. He narrowly avoids a midair collision, but the jet damages Rayfords fuel line. He decides his only option is to return to New York and hope his fuel holds out.On the ground, Chloe hears her fathers mayday call on her cell phone and assumes his plane has crashed. She later finds her mothers jewelry left behind in the shower, as she has also disappeared. Chloe makes her way to New Hope Village Church to discover family pastor Bruce Barnes, who explains God has taken his believers to heaven, and the rest have to face the end of days. The pastor explains he was not taken because he did not really believe what he had preached. Rayford comes to the same conclusion by examining his copilot and stewardess personal effects. He tells Hattie the truth about his wife. She is initially upset as she did not know he was married, but Rayford convinces her to be brave and to help calm the passengers down until they can safely land.Chloe climbs to the top of a bridge, intending to jump off it and end her life, when she gets a call from Buck, who is in the cockpit with Rayford. Rayford explains to Chloe all the New York area airports are closed and the streets full, and he is low on fuel and has nowhere to land.

Meanwhile, Kyle (Tyrese Gibson), a single father driving to Los Angeles, stops at the diner. He meets the owner, Bob Hanson (Dennis Quaid); Bobs son, Jeep (Lucas Black); Percy (Charles S. Dutton), the short-order cook; Charlie (Adrianne Palicki), a pregnant waitress; Howard (Jon Tenney) and Sandra (Kate Walsh) Anderson, a married couple; and Audrey (Willa Holland), their rebellious teenage daughter. The elderly Gladys (Jeanette Miller) enters the diner and begins taunting the diners patrons. When Howard confronts her, she rips his throat open with her teeth before screeching that they are all going to die, and climbs up the ceiling. Kyle shoots her before she can kill Jeep. Percy, Kyle, Sandra, Audrey and Charlie try to get Howard to the hospital, but they are forced to turn back after passing through an apocalyptic swarm of flies.Michael arrives and arms the patrons as the entire sky turns black. Hundreds of cars approach, filled with possessed people who begin to attack the diner. Michael leads the patrons in the fight, but Howard is dragged away. Later, Michael explains that God has lost faith in mankind and has sent his angels to destroy the human race. He also reveals that Charlies baby must stay alive, as it is destined to be the savior of mankind; Michael disobeyed Gods order to kill Charlies baby, as he still has faith in humanity. The next morning, Sandra discovers Howard crucified behind the restaurant and covered with huge boils. She tries to rescue him, but he violently explodes into acid. Percy dies shielding Sandra from the blast. Sandra is driven insane and must be restrained. Meanwhile, the remaining survivors hear a radio transmission that reveals there are other pockets of resistance. One such refuge is nearby, but Michael advises them not to go, since they would be too vulnerable on the move.That night, a second wave of possessed people attack. Kyle is lured into a trap and killed while Charlie goes into labor. Audrey and Michael help to deliver the baby as trumpets sound, signaling the approach of the Archangel Gabriel (Kevin Durand). In a panic, Sandra breaks her restraints and tries to give the baby to the possessed, but she is executed by Michael. Moments later, Gabriel enters the diner and fatally wounds Bob. Michael urges the group to escape and tells Jeep to ""find the prophets, learn to read the instructions"". The hordes of possessed humans are unable to approach Charlies baby; Jeep, Audrey, Charlie, and the baby go to Michaels cruiser. Gabriel and Michael fight to a standstill before Gabriel stabs Michael through the chest with his morning star. Michael dies and his body disappears. Dying, Bob uses his lighter, which is engraved with ""hope,"" to ignite the diners gas main and blow up the diner, incinerating himself and the remaining possessed.Jeeps body is covered in the same mysterious drawings seen on Michaels body; Jeep concludes that the tattoos are his instructions. Gabriel appears and flies onto the fleeing car. Audrey jumps on him and yells at Jeep to slam on the brakes, sending her and Gabriel through the front windshield, as the car crashes, and buying Jeep and Charlie time to get away, but in the process Audrey is killed. Eventually Gabriel corners them in the nearby mountains and is about to kill them when Michael descends from Heaven, an Archangel again. Michael tells Gabriel that Gabriel gave God what He asked for, but Michael gave Him what He needed, giving humanity another chance; Michael says this was Gods plan to test his angels and that Gabriel failed Him. Ashamed, Gabriel leaves. Michael explains to Jeep that he is the childs true protector and that they will see Michael again, before flying away.

She goes on a pre-honeymoon with her chef fiancé Victor (Gael García Bernal) to Verona, Italy. Victor is unmoved by the romance of Italy and uses his time to research his soon-to-open restaurant, often neglecting Sophie.

378,379,Life of Pi,2012,/wiki/Life_of_Pi_(film),"In Canada, novelist Yann Martel meets Pi Patel; Martel has been told that Pis life story would be a good subject for a book. Pi tells his story to Yann:Pis father names him Piscine Molitor Patel after the swimming pool in France. In secondary school in Pondicherry, he adopts the name ""Pi"" (the Greek letter, π) to avoid the sound-alike nickname ""Pissing Patel"". He is raised in a Hindu family, but at 12 years old, is introduced to Christianity and then Islam, and decides to follow all three religions as he ""just wants to love God"". His mother supports his desire to grow, but his rationalist father tries to secularize him. Pis family owns a zoo, and Pi takes interest in the animals, especially a Bengal tiger named Richard Parker. After Pi gets dangerously close to Richard Parker, his father forces him to witness the tiger killing a goat.When Pi is 16, his father announces that they must move to Canada, where he intends to settle and sell the animals. The family books passage with the animals on a Japanese freighter. During a storm, the ship founders while Pi is on deck. He tries to find his family, but a crewman throws him into a lifeboat. A freed zebra jumps onto the boat with him, breaking its leg. The ship sinks into the Mariana Trench drowning his family. Pi briefly sees what appears to be a survivor, but it turns out to be Richard Parker.After the storm, Pi awakens in the lifeboat with the zebra, and is joined by a resourceful orangutan. A spotted hyena emerges from under a tarpaulin covering half of the lifeboat and snaps at Pi, forcing him to retreat to the end of the boat. The hyena kills the zebra and later the orangutan. Richard Parker emerges from under the tarpaulin, killing the hyena before retreating back to cover for several days.Pi fashions a small tethered raft from flotation vests which he retreats to for safety from Richard Parker. Despite his moral code against killing, he begins fishing, enabling him to sustain the tiger as well. When the tiger jumps into the sea to hunt for fish and then comes threateningly towards Pi, Pi considers letting him drown, but ultimately helps him back into the boat. One night, a humpback whale breaches near the boat, destroying the raft and its supplies. Pi trains Richard Parker to accept him in the boat, and realizes that caring for the tiger is also helping keep himself alive.Weeks later they encounter a floating island of interconnected trees. It is a lush jungle of edible plants, fresh water pools and a large population of meerkats, enabling Pi and Richard Parker to eat and drink freely and regain strength. At night, the island transforms into a hostile environment. Richard Parker retreats to the lifeboat while Pi and the meerkats sleep in the trees; the water pools turn acidic, digesting the fish in them. Pi deduces that the island is carnivorous after finding a human tooth embedded in a flower.Pi and Richard Parker leave the island, eventually reaching the coast of Mexico. Pi is saddened that Richard Parker does not acknowledge him before disappearing into the jungle. He is rescued and brought to a hospital. Insurance agents for the Japanese freighter company interview him, but do not believe his story and ask what really happened. He tells a different story, in which the animals are replaced by human survivors: his mother for the orangutan, an amiable sailor for the zebra, and the ships brutish cook for the hyena. In this story, the cook kills the sailor and feeds on his flesh. He also kills Pis mother after which Pi kills him with a knife and uses his remains as food and fish bait. The insurance agents are dissatisfied with this story, but they leave without questioning Pi further.Yann recognizes the parallels between the two stories, noting that in the second one, Pi fills the role of the tiger. Pi asks which story the writer prefers, and Yann chooses the first, to which Pi replies, ""and so it goes with God"". Glancing at a copy of the insurance report, Yann sees that the agents also chose the first story.",120000000,"[{""id"": 12, ""name"": ""Adventure""}, {""id"": 18, ""name"": ""Drama""}, {""id"": 28, ""name"": ""Action""}]",http://www.lifeofpimovie.com/,87827,"[{""id"": 270, ""name"": ""ocean""}, {""id"": 2580, ""name"": ""shipwreck""}, {""id"": 4096, ""name"": ""hindu""}, {""id"": 4809, ""name"": ""tiger""}, {""id"": 6150, ""name"": ""faith""}, {""id"": 12971, ""name"": ""zookeeper""}, {""id"": 18068, ""name"": ""teenage boy""}, {""id"": 158022, ""name"": ""cargo ship""}, {""id"": 163000, ""name"": ""lifeboat""}, {""id"": 163014, ""name"": ""injured animal""}]",en,"The story of an Indian boy named Pi, a zookeeper's son who finds himself in the company of a hyena, zebra, orangutan, and a Bengal tiger after a shipwreck sets them adrift in the Pacific Ocean.",51.328145,"[{""name"": ""Ingenious Film Partners"", ""id"": 289}, {""name"": ""Ingenious Media"", ""id"": 290}, {""name"": ""Dune Entertainment"", ""id"": 444}, {""name"": ""Fox 2000 Pictures"", ""id"": 711}, {""name"": ""Big Screen Productions"", ""id"": 10893}, {""name"": ""Haishang Films"", ""id"": 13480}]","[{""iso_3166_1"": ""US"", ""name"": ""United States of America""}, {""iso_3166_1"": ""TW"", ""name"": ""Taiwan""}, {""iso_3166_1"": ""GB"", ""name"": ""United Kingdom""}]",11/20/2012,609016565,127,"[{""iso_639_1"": ""zh"", ""name"": ""\u666e\u901a\u8bdd""}, {""iso_639_1"": ""en"", ""name"": ""English""}, {""iso_639_1"": ""fr"", ""name"": ""Fran\u00e7ais""}, {""iso_639_1"": ""hi"", ""name"": ""\u0939\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0926\u0940""}, {""iso_639_1"": ""ja"", ""name"": ""\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e""}, {""iso_639_1"": ""ta"", ""name"": ""\u0ba4\u0bae\u0bbf\u0bb4\u0bcd""}]",Released,Believe The Unbelievable,Life of Pi,7.2,5797,0.5,0.784924269,0.209247112,0.5,-0.290752888,0.575677156,-0.284924269,0.383784771,5.075138042

After graduation, Anna decides to spend the summer with Jacob rather than return to the United Kingdom, unaware of the consequences of overstaying her student visa, which expired upon her graduation. After returning to London for a family engagement, Anna flies back to Los Angeles, where she is detained, denied entry, and deported to the United Kingdom by immigration officials.The couples love for each other grows strained by their separation and long-distance relationship. Despite her efforts at appealing the immigration decision, Anna is told she is banned from entering the United States. Meanwhile, Jacob leaves behind his successful design business and visits Anna in London for a few weeks. There, he learns that Annas parents, Bernard (Oliver Muirhead) and Jackie (Alex Kingston), have hired an immigration lawyer to try to get the ban lifted. Bernard suggests that marrying may help their efforts. Jacob is uncomfortable with the suggestion, and the couple struggle with their feelings.After Jacob returns to the United States, he and Anna grow apart, and Jacob begins a relationship with his colleague, Samantha (Jennifer Lawrence). Anna also tries to find a new life for herself, beginning work as a secretary for a magazine, but she is unable to abandon her feelings for Jacob. She eventually phones him from London and says that they will never find in others what they found in each other, and that they should marry. Soon after, Jacob breaks up with Samantha, returns to London and marries Anna in a small registry office ceremony with her parents as witnesses—both affirming that they will ""never allow anything to destroy the feelings we share for each other"".

When Pepper asks a doctor if he has dwarfism, the doctor tells him, ""For now, Pepper, lets just say youre a little boy,"" this expression would become Peppers nickname. He would learn to despise those two words and always make a problem when someone would call out his nickname.However, when World War II begins, Peppers older brother is declared ineligible for military service because of flat feet and his father joins in his place, which devastates Pepper. Not long after his father leaves for war, Pepper hears the Bible verse, ""Truly I tell you, if you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, ‘Move from here to there,’ and it will move"" (Matthew 17:20), he becomes determined to get enough faith to bring his father home.  Nevertheless, as his friend and mentor Father Oliver tells him, faith is useless to anyone who harbors hatred. Father Oliver tells Pepper to befriend a Japanese man named Hashimoto.At first, the anti-Japanese sentiment Pepper has internalized - which has become prevalent in his society - makes him hesitant to follow this advice, but as he gets to know Hashimoto, he begins to value their friendship and learns from Hashimoto to stand up to those who bully him about his height.  Father Oliver gave Pepper a list of tasks to complete. When Peppers father is reported missing in action, Peppers mother (Emily Watson) struggles to keep her family together in the face of these overwhelming hardships. His brother London, and Sam - one of the townspeople that lost a son - go to Hashimotos home and attack him one night, leading to him being hospitalized. London is initially arrested, but Hashimoto decides not to press charges and he is released.An Army representative brings the news that Peppers father has been killed and is buried in the Philippines. Hashimoto goes to the memorial service at the OHare Cemetery to pay his respects. Pepper and Hashimoto sit on a bench and discuss their mutual losses of family and believing in something. Pepper goes back to the cemetery to visit his fathers grave and place the list on top of his grave marker. Pepper and his mother go to the doctor, where the town doctor, Dr. Fox tries to hit on her and invite himself over to the house that evening under the pretext of talking about what could possibly be the cause of Peppers short stature.Later that day, a spokesperson from the Army arrives to tell her that her husband didnt die after all. The man that actually died had stolen Peppers fathers boots, with his dog tags attached to the laces, when he fell after being shot, so he was misidentified as Peppers father.  The family leaves town to visit James in the hospital and Pepper takes him the boots that James had been eyeing for some time, which Pepper bought for him after he went off to war. Upon arriving, they realize that James has suffered from mild amnesia due to an injury to the head. However, Pepper calls his father by his longtime nickname, ""partner"", and presents him his gift.

381,382,Little Fockers,2010,/wiki/Little_Fockers,"Five years after the events of the previous film, Gaylord ""Greg"" Focker (Stiller) is preparing to celebrate his twins Samantha and Henrys fifth-birthday party. Things seem to go awry when Gregs father-in-law Jack Byrnes (De Niro) visits. Recently, Jack has been diagnosed with a heart condition and become embittered by his daughter Debbies divorce from her husband Bob (their marriage was the social event in the first film and how Jack and Greg met), for cheating on her with a nurse. Jacks original plan was to declare Bob his successor as head of the Byrnes family, but he decides to pass the role to Greg, naming him ""The Godfocker"". Despite Greg reluctantly accepting the role, Jack resumes his spying on him and begins to suspect him of infidelity when he sees him with drug representative Andi Garcia (Alba), who openly flirts with him, and the presence of Sustengo erection pills in Gregs house prompts Jack to think Greg is no longer sexually attracted to his wife Pam (Polo). Furthermore, Jack starts to doubt Gregs ability to provide for his family when he appears reluctant to send his children to a private school.During a medical conference promoting Sustengo, Greg meets Bob at a bar. Bob tells Greg of Jacks original intention to name him as successor, ""The Bobfather"", and his relief and happiness at leaving Jacks family makes Greg slightly uncomfortable. Meanwhile, Jack speaks to Pam about the possibility of divorcing Greg and renewing her relationship with her ex-fiancé, Kevin Rawley (Wilson). Eventually, following a row at a clinic, Greg escapes to his and Pams unfinished new house, where Andi turns up. She tries to cheer him up with takeout and wine, but she drinks so much wine (also popping many erection pills) that she gets excessively drunk and makes an eccentric, extremely aggressive sexual pass on Greg. Jack, looking for Greg so he can apologize to him and bring him home, pulls up to the house and sees through the window what looks like Greg and Andi having sex, although Greg is actually trying to rebuff Andis advances. Disgusted, Jack leaves, and tells Dina and Pam that he couldnt find Greg.Gregs parents Bernie (Hoffman) and Roz (Streisand) rejoin the family at the twins birthday party the next day. Enraged at Gregs apparent infidelity, Jack engages him in a physical fight, despite Greg claiming that Andi was drunk and he was rebuffing her. The fight culminates with Jack having a heart attack and collapsing, and Greg quickly taking charge of the situation and looking after Jack. As paramedics take him away, Jack quietly admits that he believes Greg after feeling his carotid artery, which remained stable while Greg was claiming his innocence. Impressed with Greg for his integrity and quick thinking, Jack approves Greg to be the Godfocker.Four months later, on Christmas Day, Greg and Pams parents come to spend Christmas with them in their new house. Gregs parents (who are Jewish) give Jack a kippah as his present, informing him that while they were nursing him back to health they traced his family roots and discovered that he is part Jewish (which doesnt impress Jack). Bernie informs Greg and Pam that he and Roz have sold their Miami Island home and are moving to Chicago, only two houses down from their house. Jack and Dina decide they will move too, because they also want to be close to their grandchildren. The film ends with Greg and Pam trying to wean their parents off the idea.During the credits, Jack is back in his home on Long Island. He has grown fond of the search engine Google (having used it to do research on Andi earlier in the film). With Mr. Jinx, the familys cat, Jack watches a video of Greg on YouTube in which Greg mocks him at the Sustengo conference. Jack then discovers a remixed version of the video using puns of several of the words in the video, and is slightly amused.",100000000,"[{""id"": 35, ""name"": ""Comedy""}, {""id"": 10749, ""name"": ""Romance""}]",http://www.littlefockers.net/,39451,"[{""id"": 428, ""name"": ""nurse""}, {""id"": 977, ""name"": ""cat""}, {""id"": 4604, ""name"": ""father-in-law""}, {""id"": 5569, ""name"": ""vomit""}, {""id"": 9963, ""name"": ""kids and family""}, {""id"": 10425, ""name"": ""viagra""}, {""id"": 179431, ""name"": ""duringcreditsstinger""}]",en,"It has taken 10 years, two little Fockers with wife Pam and countless hurdles for Greg to finally get in with his tightly wound father-in-law, Jack.

382,383,Lockout,2012,/wiki/Lockout_(film),"In 2079, CIA agent Snow is arrested for murdering undercover agent Frank Armstrong, who had uncovered evidence of another agent selling secrets about the space program. Secret Service director Scott Langral, on advice from the President, has Snow convicted of murder and espionage. Snow is sentenced to thirty years on the maximum security space penitentiary MS One, where prisoners are kept in stasis for the length of their sentence. Snows friend and fellow agent Harry Shaw tries to locate Snows contact Mace, who knows where Franks briefcase containing the stolen secrets is hidden.Meanwhile, the Presidents daughter Emilie arrives on MS One to investigate claims that keeping prisoners in stasis can cause them to develop mental instability. The warden allows her to interview Hydell, a deranged prisoner. He manages to escape and releases all of the prisoners, starting a riot led by his brother Alex. Emilie is shot, and is captured along with others. Shaw convinces Langral and the President to send Snow to rescue Emilie, rather than risk her life in a siege. Snow is initially reluctant to go, but agrees after Shaw tells him that Mace is on MS One and could help Snow prove his innocence. Langral initially attempts to trick Alex into releasing Emilie, but it goes bad and Snow is forced to infiltrate MS One. Alex realizes that Emilie is the Presidents daughter and secures her, but she escapes with her bodyguard Hock and they hide in a secure room. A problem with the oxygen supply brings Hock to sacrifice his life by suicide in order to stop himself from using up oxygen so as to buy Emilie more time.Snow breaks into the secure room and rescues Emilie after administering first aid for her wounds. Snow then changes Emilies hair & clothing to conceal her gender, allowing them to walk through the prison population without being noticed. They find Mace, but the stasis has given him dementia and made him incoherent. Snow and Emilie bring Mace with them and attempt to reach the escape pod. With no one at the helm, the prison falls out of orbit and crashes into the International Space Station. The collision causes a hull breach, killing Mace. Snow brings Emilie to the escape pod, but discovers it has only one seat. Realizing that he has been sent there to die, he sends Emilie on her way, but she allows the pod to launch without her because she believes the remaining hostages will be killed. Hydell contacts Emilie and threatens the hostages unless she reveals her location; after she does, however, he kills them anyway.Snow and Emilie discover evidence that the prisoners were being illegally used as test subjects. Alex finds and captures Emilie; he also shoots Snow, leaving him for dead. Alex learns that Hydell has killed all of the hostages; he contacts the President, threatening to let Hydell and the prisoners rape Emilie if they are not released. The President refuses to allow a siege and risk Emilie, causing Langral to temporarily relieve him of his command. Langral orders the destruction of MS One. Hydell tries to rape Emilie as promised, but is stopped by Alex. Hydell and Alex fight, resulting in Alexs death. Hydell then tries to stab Emilie, but Snow arrives and knocks him out. Snow and Emilie flee from Hydell and the remaining prisoners. Meanwhile, Langrals men plant a bomb on the prison. Snow and Emilie use space suits and jump from MS One as it detonates. Using their suits, Snow and Emilie re-enter Earths atmosphere and land safely in New York City, where Snow is arrested.Emilie later realizes that Maces incoherent rambling was actually a code revealing the location of Franks briefcase. Snow gives the briefcase to Shaw, who unlocks it but is shocked to find it empty. Snow notes that he had not given Shaw the unlocking code, and Shaw is revealed to be the mole and arrested. Snow is released and his possessions returned, including a lighter given to him by Frank before his death. Examining the lighter, Snow finds a memory card containing the real secret information hidden inside.

383,384,London Has Fallen,2016,/wiki/London_Has_Fallen,"Western intelligence services of the G8 track down Pakistani arms dealer Aamir Barkawi (Alon Moni Aboutboul) as the mastermind behind several terrorist attacks, and authorize an American drone strike on Barkawis compound, apparently killing Barkawi and his family.Two years later, UK Prime Minister James Wilson suddenly dies, and arrangements are made for the Western world leaders to attend his funeral in London. Secret Service Director Lynne Jacobs (Angela Bassett) assigns agent Mike Banning (Gerard Butler), a close friend of U.S. President Benjamin Asher (Aaron Eckhart), to lead Ashers security detail while overseas, even though Bannings wife Leah (Radha Mitchell) is due to give birth to their child in a few weeks. The entourage arrives via Air Force One at Stansted Airport, and Banning pushes their arrival at Somerset House in London via Marine One to earlier. As Ashers Presidential State Car arrives at St Pauls Cathedral, a series of coordinated attacks by terrorists disguised as Metropolitan Police, the Queens Guardsmen, and other first responders erupts, killing the other Western leaders, damaging or destroying major landmarks and generating mass panic. Ashers early arrival has thrown the attack on him at St. Pauls off-guard, and Banning is able to rescue Asher and Jacobs and rushes them back to Marine One. As the helicopter and its escorts takes off, terrorists fire Stinger missiles at them, destroying the escorts and forcing the damaged helicopter to crash-land in Hyde Park. Banning and Asher suffer only minor wounds, but Jacobs is fatally injured, and she makes Banning promise to stay alive for his unborn child and get back at whoever did this. Banning quickly escorts Asher into the London Underground as the citys power is lost and people take shelter in their homes.In Washington, D.C., U.S. Vice President Allan Trumbull (Morgan Freeman) works with the British authorities to investigate the incident while trying to track down the President. Trumbull receives a call from Barkawi, still alive after all and operating out of Yemen. The man takes responsibility for the attacks, coordinated by his son Kamran (Waleed Zuaiter). Barkawi purposely had Wilson poisoned to lure the Western leaders to London to attack them. Barkawi knows Asher is still alive, and promises that if Kamran captures him, he will broadcast the execution of the President on the Internet. Trumbull orders his intelligence staff to locate Barkawis known operatives to find any connection to the attack, while British authorities have all first responders stand down, so that any left in the open can be identified as terrorists.After leaving a sign to be picked up by satellite tracking, Banning leads Asher to an MI6 safe-house, where Jacqueline ""Jax"" Marshall (Charlotte Riley) briefs them on what their intelligence has learned. Marshall receives a voice message from Trumbull that confirms they saw Bannings sign and that an extraction team is en route. Security monitors show the approach of a Delta Force team, but Banning suspects they have arrived far too soon and may be more terrorists. He covers and fights off the terrorists before Asher and Banning drive away, but their car is struck by a truck driven by terrorists, allowing them to kidnap Asher. Banning is rescued by the extraction team, a combined Delta Force/S.A.S. squad. They also suspect that there is a mole in the British government.Trumbulls staff have identified a building in London owned by one of Barkawis companies, which still appears to be drawing massive amounts of power despite supposedly being under construction and unoccupied, and suspect it is Kamrans headquarters. Banning joins the extraction team to infiltrate the building and stop Kamran before he can kill Asher. Banning and Asher escape just before the building is destroyed by the Delta Force/SAS squad, killing Kamran and the remaining terrorists. Marshall has worked with British authorities to restore Londons security system and, discovering that MI5 Intelligence Chief John Lancaster (Patrick Kennedy) aided in Barkawis attack, she kills him. Meanwhile, Trumbull contacts Barkawi to tell him that his plan failed, and then to look outside, moments before the building is destroyed by another drone strike, killing him.Two weeks after the attack on London, Banning is home spending time with Leah and their newborn child, named Lynne after his deceased boss. He sits in front of his laptop and contemplates sending his letter of resignation. On TV, Trumbull speaks regarding the recent events, leaving an inspiring message that the U.S. will prevail.

384,385,Lone Survivor,2013,/wiki/Lone_Survivor,"In 2005 Afghanistan, Taliban leader Ahmad Shah is responsible for killing over twenty United States Marines, as well as villagers and refugees who were aiding American forces. In response to these killings, a United States Navy SEALs unit is ordered to execute a counter-insurgent mission to capture Shah. As part of the mission, a four-man SEAL reconnaissance and surveillance team is tasked with locating Shah. The four SEALs include team leader Michael Murphy; snipers Marcus Luttrell and Matthew Axelson; and communications specialist Danny Dietz.The team is inserted into the Hindu Kush region of Afghanistan, where they make a trek through the mountains where they begin to encounter communications problems. Arriving at their designated location, the SEALs are accidentally discovered by local goat herders, who the SEALs detain. Knowing that if they release them, the herders will likely alert the Taliban to their presence, the team is split about whether to kill the herders or not. After a brief debate, the team chooses to release them and abort the mission, but before they can escape, they are attacked by Taliban forces. Although the SEALs kill several Taliban gunmen, they are heavily outnumbered and at a disadvantage, and the men take on various wounds during the firefight, worsened when they jump off the edge of a ridge and into a large ravine.Despite their injuries, the SEALs make a defensive retreat through the steep woods. Dietz begins to lose consciousness and shouts questions to Luttrell, unwittingly revealing the teams position. Murphy and Axelson jump off another ridge lead the escape while Luttrell tries to carry Dietz down the mountain, but Dietz is shot again; the impact forces Luttrell to lose his grip and fall off the cliff. A dying Dietz remains at the top of the cliff and is killed. Murphy attempts to climb back up the cliff to get a phone signal in order to call for support via satellite phone with Axelson and Luttrell providing cover fire. When he finally reaches higher ground, Murphy is able to alert his unit of his teams predicament and request assistance before he is killed himself.In response to Murphys distress call, a quick reaction force made up of fellow SEALs boards Chinook helicopters and heads toward the location without gunship escort. When they arrive, the Taliban shoot down one of the helicopters, killing all eight Navy SEALs and eight Special Operations aviators aboard, while the second helicopter is forced back. Luttrell and Axelson are left to fend for themselves again. Axelson attempts to find cover but is killed when he leaves his hiding spot to attack several approaching insurgents. When Luttrell is discovered by the Taliban, one of the insurgents fires a rocket-propelled grenade, and its impact throws him to the bottom of a rock crevice where he is able to hide from the Taliban and eventually escape.Luttrell stumbles upon a small body of water where a local Pashtun villager, Mohammad Gulab, discovers him. Gulab takes Luttrell into his care, returning to his village, where he attempts to hide Luttrell in his home. Gulab then sends a mountain man to the nearest American base to alert them to Luttrells location. Taliban fighters arrive at the village to take Luttrell, but Gulab and the villagers intervene, threatening to kill the fighters if they harm Luttrell. The fighters leave, but later return to punish the villagers for protecting Luttrell. Gulab and his villagers are initially able to fend off the attackers but are nearly overrun and Luttrell badly wounded when American forces arrive and defeat the advancing Taliban. After thanking the villagers who had saved him, Luttrell is evacuated. He almost succumbs to his injuries but is revived in time.Images of the real Luttrell, Gulab and the fallen service members killed during the mission are shown during a four-minute montage, and an epilogue reveals that the Pashtun villagers agreed to help Luttrell as part of a traditional code of honor known as the Pashtunwali.",40000000,"[{""id"": 28, ""name"": ""Action""}, {""id"": 18, ""name"": ""Drama""}, {""id"": 53, ""name"": ""Thriller""}, {""id"": 10752, ""name"": ""War""}]",http://www.lonesurvivorfilm.com/,193756,"[{""id"": 6091, ""name"": ""war""}, {""id"": 10349, ""name"": ""survival""}, {""id"": 11219, ""name"": ""navy seal""}, {""id"": 162365, ""name"": ""military""}, {""id"": 181325, ""name"": ""dangerous mission""}]",en,"Based on the failed June 28, 2005 mission ""Operation Red Wing.""

Since future tracking systems have made it near-impossible to dispose of bodies, the syndicate uses time travel, invented thirty years later and outlawed instantly. Managed by a future man named Abe, loopers kill and dispose of face-concealed victims, and are paid with silver bars strapped to the target. To prevent connections to the syndicate, a loopers final victim will be their retired future self (identified by gold bars strapped to them instead of silver), ending the contract and ""closing the loop"".Joes friend Seth, part of a minority that manifest low-level telekinesis (or TK), confides that his old self has escaped, after warning him of a person in the future called the Rainmaker who will overthrow the five major bosses and close all loops.

Young Joe collects a corner of Old Joes map as both escape.Young Joe follows the map to a farm where a woman Sara and her son Cid live. Sara recognizes a number on the map as Cids birthday and hospital code. Young Joe guesses that Old Joe is going to kill all three children born on the same day, not knowing which one will become the Rainmaker, so he stays at the farm to wait for Old Joe.Jesse, another Gat Man, comes looking for both Joes at the farm, but Cid and Young Joe hide. Later that night, Sara and Young Joe have sex and Sara reveals she has TK powers. Cids powers are revealed to be even stronger, with Sara hiding in a safe when he has a tantrum.

The van explodes, killing the team and MacGruber is removed from the case. MacGruber convinces Piper to form a new team, now including Vicki.The group travels to Cunths nightclub in Las Vegas. MacGruber gets on stage and announces who he is, his intentions, and where he will be the next day. The team sets up a sting operation with Vicki portraying MacGruber. Hoss Bender, one of Cunths henchmen, attacks the van MacGruber and Piper are in, but MacGruber runs down Bender. With Vicki disguised as Bender and Piper disguised as MacGruber, the team breaks into a warehouse to stop Cunth from getting the passwords to operate the rocket. MacGruber distracts the guards and Piper kills most of the men, but is unable to stop the transfer of the pass codes. The team goes to a charity event Cunth is holding and Cunths guards throw MacGruber out.MacGruber returns to the Pentagon where Faith reprimands him and takes him off of the case. Soldiers attack and MacGruber uses Piper as a human shield to survive; Vicki and MacGruber escape. Piper survives since he was wearing a bulletproof vest, but leaves since MacGruber used him as protection. Vicki and MacGruber return to Vickis house where the two have sex. MacGruber goes to his wifes grave in shame, but her ghost gives her blessing. MacGruber then has sex with the ghost of his wife on her tombstone.Upon returning to Vickis house, MacGruber discovers that Cunth has kidnapped her and what Cunths plan is: to bomb the State of the Union address. Cunth calls MacGruber to gloat, but MacGruber traces the call. MacGruber and Piper make their way into Cunths compound. Soldiers capture MacGruber and Piper and bring them to Vicki and the missile. The group overpowers Cunth and his men and MacGruber handcuffs Cunth to a handrail. MacGruber removes the nuclear component and guidance system before his team escapes as the missile explodes.Six months later, MacGruber and Vicki are getting married. Also present at the wedding as ghosts are his dead team members. MacGruber spots a disfigured Cunth with an RPG. MacGruber saves Vicki, and battles Cunth before throwing him off a cliff behind the altar, shooting him with a machine gun and launching a grenade as he falls, incinerating the corpse, and finally urinating on it at the foot of the cliff.",10000000,"[{""id"": 28, ""name"": ""Action""}, {""id"": 12, ""name"": ""Adventure""}, {""id"": 35, ""name"": ""Comedy""}]",http://iamrogue.com/macgruber/,37931,"[{""id"": 179430, ""name"": ""aftercreditsstinger""}, {""id"": 179431, ""name"": ""duringcreditsstinger""}]",en,"Ex-special operative MacGruber (Forte) is called back into action to take down his archenemy, Dieter Von Cunth (Kilmer), who's in possession of a nuclear warhead and bent on destroying Washington, DC.",14.038512,"[{""name"": ""Relativity Media"", ""id"": 7295}]","[{""iso_3166_1"": ""US"", ""name"": ""United States of America""}]",5/21/2010,6110000,90,"[{""iso_639_1"": ""en"", ""name"": ""English""}, {""iso_639_1"": ""ru"", ""name"": ""P\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439""}]",Released,He's the ultimate tool.,MacGruber,5.1,179,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0,0,0,0,0.611

Michael Booth (Jeff Fahey), a local businessman and spin doctor, explains to Machete that corrupt Texas State Senator John McLaughlin (Robert De Niro) is sending hundreds of illegal immigrants out of the country. In order to stop this, Booth offers Machete $150,000 to kill McLaughlin. Machete accepts the murder contract after Booth threatens to kill him if he does not.Machete trains a rifle on McLaughlin from a rooftop during a rally, but before he fires he sees one of Booths henchmen aiming at him. The henchman shoots Machete in the shoulder, the latter then shoots McLaughlin in the leg. It is revealed that Booth orchestrated the attempted assassination as part of a false flag operation to gain public support for McLaughlins secure border campaign. By setting up Machete as the gunman, the conspirators make it appear that an outlaw illegal Mexican immigrant has tried to assassinate the senator, who is known for his tough stance on illegal immigration.An injured Machete escapes capture by Booth and is taken to a hospital to be treated for wounds, escaping once again from Booths henchmen at the hospital. Agent Sartana Rivera (Jessica Alba), a persistent U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent, is sent by her superior to find and capture the injured Machete. Machete, with the help of Luz (Michelle Rodriguez), aka Shé, the leader of an illegal immigrant aid movement known as the Network, recruits Padre (Cheech Marin), his ""holy"" brother. To take revenge on Booth, Machete kidnaps Booths wife and his daughter, April (Lindsay Lohan), after ""starring"" in an amateur adult film with them. He also collects evidence from Booths house linking McLaughlin and the Mexican drug lord in a major drug trafficking deal. After encountering Machete, Sartana begins to develop an interest in him. Elsewhere, Booth, who is revealed to be working for Torrez, hires a hitman, Osiris Amanpour (Tom Savini), to assist in the hunt for Machete.Booth and Osiris kill Padre in his church by nailing him to a cross, but do not find his own wife and daughter. Unbeknownst to Booth, the church has cameras. Through the CCTV recordings, the news of McLaughlins corruption and faked assassination is eventually aired on national television. Infuriated, McLaughlin kills Booth and heads back to join Torrez to kill Machete.

389,390,Machine Gun Preacher,2011,/wiki/Machine_Gun_Preacher,"In South Sudan the LRA are attacking a village and force a young boy to attack a woman.Sam Childers (Gerard Butler) is an alcoholic drug-using biker from Pennsylvania. On his release from prison, he finds that his wife (Michelle Monaghan) has given up her job as a stripper, because she has since accepted Christ as her saviour. Initially infuriated by his wifes decision, he returns to his routine of partying and using drugs like heroin with his fellow biker friend Donnie (Michael Shannon). One night while on a bender with Donnie, he almost kills a vagrant. He is shaken by the experience, and the day after allows his wife to persuade him to go to church with her, where he is eventually baptized and offered salvation. Sam soon finds a stable job as a construction worker and later starts his own construction company. Later, on a missionary trip to Uganda to build homes for refugees, he asks one of the SPLA soldiers watching over them to take him on a trip to the north, to Sudan. The soldier warns him that it is a war zone, but upon Sams insistence they go. They arrive at a medical tent in Sudan. As the soldier moves off to talk to some people, Sam is roped in by a female doctor to help lift a lipless Sudanese woman onto the examination table. That night as they lay on their beds at the relief station, they hear noises outside, and when they look out, Sam and the soldier see large numbers of Sudanese children swarming around to sleep outside the building. The soldier explains that their parents send them to sleep over here because it is safer than staying in their own village. Sam wakes up the children and gets as many as he can fit to sleep in their room for the night. The next day Sam and the soldier follow the children back to their village only to find that the LRA has burnt it down and killed their parents. One of the children runs after his dog and is killed by a hidden landmine. Sam cradles the dead child and cries, the experience traumatizes and changes Sam. After returning home, Sam has a ""vision from God"" and decides to build an orphanage for the children of South Sudan, as well as a church in his own neighborhood that will be ""open to all"" without judgement. After its completion he begins preaching at his church, and helps his old friend Donnie get sober and find God as well. He soon returns to Africa and despite vocal opposition, builds the orphanage. One night after it is built, the LRA attack it and burn it to the ground. Sam then phones home, telling his wife what has happened and that he is giving up. She reminds him that the orphans have been through worse but they have not given up, and that he should not give up and tells him to rebuild the orphanage. After the orphanage has been rebuilt, he and his friends from the SPLA are attacked on the road by the LRA, they manage to chase off the small force of the LRA that attacked them. They search the area and discover a large group of Sudanese children hiding in a ditch not far from the road. Since they can not take all the children in one trip, Sam chooses to take the ones who need medical attention along with a few others on their first trip back to the orphanage. However, upon returning to the spot as quickly as he could, he finds that the LRA killed and burnt those he had left behind. This causes Childers to lead armed raids to rescue children from the LRA.He returns home to the U.S. disgruntled and exasperated about the lack of money for the project. He also feels disconnected from his community; he is disgusted by the excess displayed and petty ""problems"" of his family and friends, as well as their apparent apathy toward the children of Sudan. Sam even goes far as to neglecting his family and beating up a biker at a bar for making racist comments about the children. Meanwhile his friend Donnie breaks his sobriety and ends up dying from an overdose, this pushes Sam further into negativity and despair. He sells his business and boards a plane for Sudan. His faith and mission is revitalised when an orphan boy tells his personal story to Sam. The boy tells him that if he allows hatred to fester in his heart, his fight against injustice fails. Sam also rekindles his emotional attachment with his family over the phone. The next day he engages with the camp actively. Later he goes out with SPLA and rescues a caravan full of children who were kidnapped by LRA. The end credits include black and white pictures of the real Sam Childers, his wife, daughter, and his orphanage in Sudan.

390,391,Mad Max: Fury Road,2015,/wiki/Mad_Max:_Fury_Road,"Following an energy crisis, the world has become a desert wasteland and civilization has collapsed. Max Rockatansky, a survivor, is captured by the War Boys, the army of the tyrannical Immortan Joe, and taken to Joes Citadel. Designated a universal blood donor, Max is imprisoned and used as a ""blood bag"" for a sick War Boy called Nux. Meanwhile, Imperator Furiosa, one of Joes lieutenants, is sent in her armoured semi-truck, the ""War Rig"", to collect gasoline. When she drives off-route, Joe realizes that his five wives—women selected for breeding—are missing, and fleeing with her. Joe leads his entire army in pursuit of Furiosa, calling on the aid of nearby Gas Town and the Bullet Farm.Nux joins the pursuit with Max strapped to his car to continue supplying blood. A battle ensues between the War Rig and Joes forces. Furiosa drives into a sand storm, evading her pursuers, except Nux, who attempts to sacrifice himself to destroy the Rig. Max escapes and restrains Nux, but the car is destroyed. After the storm, Max finds Furiosa repairing the Rig, accompanied by the wives: Capable, Cheedo, Toast, the Dag, and the Splendid Angharad, who is heavily pregnant with Joes child. Max steals the Rig, but Furiosa has activated a kill switch which disables it. Max reluctantly agrees to let Furiosa and the wives accompany him; Nux climbs on the Rig as it leaves and attempts to kill Furiosa, but is overcome and thrown out, and is picked up by Joes army.Furiosa drives through a biker gang-controlled canyon to barter a deal for safe passage. However, with Joes forces pursuing, the gang turns on her, forcing her and the group to flee, while the bikers detonate the canyon walls to block Joe. Max and Furiosa fight pursuing bikers as Joes car, with Nux now on board, breaks through the blockade and eventually attacks the War Rig, allowing Nux to board and once again attempts to attack Furiosa, but fails and falls to the disappointment of Joe. However, as the Rig escapes, Angharad also falls off trying to protect Max and is run over by Joes car, killing her and her child. Furiosa explains to Max that they are escaping to the ""Green Place"", an idyllic land she remembers from her childhood. Capable finds Nux hiding in the Rig, distraught over his failure, and consoles him. That night, the Rig gets stuck in the mud. Furiosa and Max slow Joes forces with mines, but Joes ally, the Bullet Farmer, continues pursuing them. Nux helps Max free the Rig while Furiosa shoots and blinds the Bullet Farmer. Max walks into the dark to confront the Bullet Farmer and his men, wordlessly returning with guns and ammunition and covered in blood.They drive the War Rig overnight through swampland and desert, coming across a naked woman the next day. Max suspects a trap, though Furiosa approaches the woman and states her history and clan affiliation. The naked woman summons her clan, the Vuvalini, who recognize Furiosa as one of their own who was kidnapped as a child. Furiosa is devastated to learn that the swampland they passed was indeed the Green Place, now uninhabitable. The group then plans to ride motorbikes across immense salt flats in the hope of finding a new home. Max chooses to stay behind, but after seeing visions of a child he failed to save, he convinces them to return to the undefended Citadel, which has ample water and greenery that Joe keeps for himself, and trap Joe and his army in the bikers canyon.The group heads back to the Citadel, but they are attacked en route by Joes forces, and Furiosa is seriously wounded. Joe positions his car in front of the War Rig to slow it, while Max fights Joes giant son, Rictus Erectus. Joe captures Toast, who manages to distract him long enough for Furiosa to kill him. Nux sacrifices himself by wrecking the Rig, killing Rictus and blocking the canyon, allowing Max, Furiosa, the wives, and the surviving Vuvalini to escape in Joes car, where Max transfuses his blood to Furiosa, saving her life.At the Citadel, the impoverished citizens react to Joes death with joy.

391,392,Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa,2012,/wiki/Madagascar:_Escape_2_Africa,"In Africa, Zuba the lion tries to teach his son Alakay how to fight, but the cub is more interested in dancing. Rival male Makunga challenges Zuba for the title of alpha lion, and during their fight Alakay is captured by poachers. The crate containing Alakay falls into the ocean and drifts to New York City, where he is renamed Alex and grows up at the Central Park Zoo with Marty the zebra, Melman the giraffe, and Gloria the hippopotamus.Years later, following their adventure in Madagascar, the zoo animals—Alex, Marty, Melman, Gloria, the penguins Skipper, Kowalski, Rico, and Private, and chimpanzees Mason and Phil—prepare to return to New York aboard a battered airplane piloted by the penguins, accompanied by the lemurs King Julien XIII the ring-tailed lemur, Maurice the aye-aye, and Mort the mouse lemur. The plane runs out of fuel and crash lands in continental Africa. The animals find themselves at a watering hole on a nature reserve, and are excited to meet others of their species. Alex is reunited with his parents and impresses them with tales of his status as ""the King of New York"". Marty fits in with a herd of other zebras who look and sound just like him. Melman, a hypochondriac, is distressed that the reserve has no doctors, so the other giraffes appoint him their witch doctor. Seeking romance, Gloria attracts the attention of the smooth-talking male hippopotamus, Moto Moto.Meanwhile, the penguins set about repairing the plane, assisted by numerous chimpanzees recruited by Mason and Phil. They steal vehicles from several groups of New Yorkers who are on safari and strip them for parts. Nana, a tough old woman who beat up Alex during the events of Madagascar, takes charge of the stranded tourists and helps them survive in the wilderness.The zoo animals excitement soon turns to disappointment. In a scheme to oust Zuba as alpha lion, Makunga insists that Alex complete a rite of passage which Alex mistakes for a talent contest. It is actually a fighting contest, and Makunga tricks him into choosing the strongest lion as his opponent, resulting in Alexs humiliating defeat. Faced with the duty of banishing his son, Zuba relinquishes his title as alpha and Makunga takes over. Meanwhile, Marty is dejected by the realization that the other zebras can do everything he can, believing himself no longer unique. Melman comes to believe that he is deathly ill, and Glorias interest in Moto Moto saddens him since he has secretly loved her for a long time. The four friends argue heatedly with one another. Gloria has a date with Moto Moto, but loses interest when she realizes he is only attracted to her because of her size. After a pep talk from King Julien, Melman finally reveals his feelings for Gloria.The next day, the animals panic when the watering hole dries up. Determined to redeem himself, Alex mends his friendship with Marty and they leave the reserve to investigate upriver. King Julien suggests that offering a sacrifice to the nearby volcano will restore the water. Melman, forlorn and believing he is dying, volunteers to be sacrificed. Gloria stops him from jumping into the volcano, and realizes that he is the perfect guy for her. Alex and Marty discover that the stranded New Yorkers have built a camp and dammed up the river, and Alex is captured by them. Zuba rushes to his aid, but Alex saves them both by dancing for the tourists, who remember him fondly from the zoo. Marty, Melman, Gloria, the penguins, and the chimpanzees arrive in the repaired airplane and help Alex destroy the dam, restoring the water.

392,393,Maggie,2015,/wiki/Maggie_(film),"In the present-day Midwestern United States, society struggles to function in the aftermath of a zombie pandemic barely under control (Necroambulism). Maggie Vogel (Abigail Breslin) calls her father from a broken city under curfew; her voicemail urges that he not seek her and that she loves him. Her arm was bitten. Knowing she has only weeks before the ""Necroambulist virus"" turns her cannibalistic, she left home to protect her family. Maggies father Wade (Arnold Schwarzenegger) has searched two weeks, despite her warning. Finding her in a hospital for the infected, he brings Maggie home to care for her until she must eventually be quarantined. During their return, a zombie attacks Wade at an abandoned gasoline station and he breaks its neck.At home, Maggie’s younger half-siblings Bobby and Molly (Aidan and Carsen Flowers) are leaving to stay with their aunt. Maggie talks to Bobby, who mostly understands what she is undergoing. She withdraws from her family, struggling to cope with her hopeless situation and torn about contacting her friends. Falling from a swing, she breaks a finger on her infected arm, from which black fluid oozes. Terrified, even though she feels little or no pain, and despairing over her deteriorating body, Maggie cuts off the finger. She flees outside and encounters a neighbor, Nathan, and his young daughter, both senseless with infection. Wade kills both zombies but feels extreme remorse. The responding sheriff and deputy consider Wade blameless, instead blaming Nathan’s wife Bonnie, who hid her infected family from the authorities. Bonnie visits Wade that night, decrying the dehumanizing treatment of the infected and revealing that Nathan had locked himself in with his sick daughter, becoming infected himself, rather than abandon her to death among strangers in quarantine.A doctor warns Wade that Maggie’s condition is worsening quickly, leaving him three eventual options: she can be quarantined, which Wade refuses; Wade can administer at home the same euthanasia injection offered in quarantine, which he’s warned is painful; or Wade can ""make it quick"" himself. Wade and Maggie make the most of their remaining days, reminiscing about Maggies deceased mother. Despite Maggies physical deterioration (she’s woken by maggots wriggling in her dying arm) she struggles to maintain normality. She attends a bonfire with high school friends Allie and an infected boy, Trent (Bryce Romero), whom Maggie previously dated, and whom she kisses. He tells rumors of horrible conditions at the quarantine facilities, saying he would die before going there.One day, Maggie smells food near her stepmother Caroline (Joely Richardson), though Caroline smells nothing and muses that Wade must be cooking downstairs. Finding the kitchen empty, Caroline realizes in horror that Maggie has begun to smell living flesh, in this case Carolines, as food. Maggie receives a desperate call from Trent. At his home, Trent has locked himself inside his bedroom after he too felt hunger smelling another human. Maggie tries to comfort him but watches helplessly as the police forcibly remove Trent to quarantine.Back home, Maggie encounters a trapped fox in the woods. Later she runs into her home, hysterical and coated in blood, admitting through tears to her frightened parents that she freed the fox but then couldnt stop herself from attacking it. Wade shoots the half-eaten fox. Caroline departs and urges Wade it’s time Maggie is taken away. Two officers arrive and Wade fights one of them before Maggie appears, assuring them she has not yet turned. The sympathetic sheriff leaves Wade with a warning that he’d better decide what to do with her before they next come to check on Maggie.Wade shows Maggie white daisies he’s grown in her mother’s old garden, ""Daisy"" being a nickname he sometimes uses for Maggie. She thanks him for the garden’s beauty, but also begs him to promise that he will ""make it stop"" before she grows worse. Later, Wade sits alone with his shotgun, still unable to use it. He pretends to sleep when Maggie approaches, her skin now gray and her eyes blackened. She lingers over him, smelling him, seemingly on the edge of self-control, before kissing his forehead. She then climbs to the roof and jumps off, her last memories being of herself as a child frolicking outdoors with her mother, picking a daisy.",4000000,"[{""id"": 27, ""name"": ""Horror""}]",http://www.maggiethefilm.com/,287424,"[{""id"": 4458, ""name"": ""post-apocalyptic""}, {""id"": 4565, ""name"": ""dystopia""}, {""id"": 12377, ""name"": ""zombie""}]",en,"There's a deadly zombie epidemic threatening humanity, but Wade, a small-town farmer and family man, refuses to accept defeat even when his daughter Maggie becomes infected.

Mike takes Adam under his wing and encourages him to begin stripping at Xquisite. Mike is introduced to Adams sister Brooke (Cody Horn). Despite his on-and-off relationship with a woman named Joanna (Olivia Munn), Mike finds himself attracted to Brooke and promises to look after Adam.Adam falls further into the excessive lifestyle of the Xquisite dancers, using drugs and having sexual encounters with many clients. When Dallas announces he has a plan to move their act to Miami, Mike confides in Brooke that he is tiring of the lifestyle and wants to get a small business loan to pursue his dream of opening a custom furniture business. The bank declines his loan application and Mike realizes that he has to stay in the business to continue to pay his bills. Mike later attends a hurricane party at Dallas house, where Adam becomes part of a scheme created by Tobias (Gabriel Iglesias), Xquisites DJ, to sell drugs to Xquisites clients, and is eventually given a package of ecstasy. Adam begins using drugs regularly, and Mike notices more of Adams reckless behavior, to the chagrin of Brooke, who is relying on Mike to protect him.A few days later, Mike and Adam perform for a private party at a sorority house where Adam brings the package of drugs with him. At the party, Adam gives a young woman an ecstasy pill, causing a brawl between Adam and the womans boyfriend. Mike and Adam are forced to flee without the drugs, which Adam says were worth $1,000. They also do not collect their payment, which infuriates Dallas. After the next nights show, Mike and Adam take drugs and go to a club. Adam vomits and passes out; Brooke finds him on Mikes floor the next morning. Brooke angrily confronts Mike about his lifestyle, and ends her friendship with him. Tobias and his suppliers break into Mikes house looking for Adam, revealing that the drugs were actually worth $10,000. Mike gives up most of his life savings to pay Adams debt in full.Later, before the dancers final performance at Xquisite, Mike decides he has had enough. Knowing that Dallas has no loyalty to any of them and is driven by greed, Mike leaves the club through the back. After realizing Mike is not coming back, Dallas promotes Adam to replace Mike as lead dancer. Mike drives to Brookes apartment and tells her he has quit stripping.

394,395,Maleficent,2014,/wiki/Maleficent_(film),"Maleficent is a powerful fairy living in the Moors, a magical forest realm bordering a human kingdom. As a young girl, she meets and falls in love with a human peasant boy named Stefan, whose love for Maleficent is overshadowed by his ambition. As they become older, the two grow apart, and Maleficent becomes protector of the Moors. When King Henry tries to conquer the Moors, Maleficent mortally wounds him and forces him to retreat. As he lies dying, he declares that whoever kills Maleficent will be named his successor and marry his daughter, Princess Leila. Stefan visits Maleficent in the Moors. He drugs her, but cannot bring himself to kill her. Instead, he cuts off her wings with iron, which is lethal to fairies, and presents them to the king. Devastated by Stefans betrayal, Maleficent turns the Moors into a dark kingdom. She finds a raven named Diaval to act as her wings, spy and confidant. She transforms him into different forms as needed, including human.After some time, Diaval informs Maleficent that Stefan, now king, is hosting a christening for his newborn daughter, Aurora. Bent on revenge, Maleficent arrives uninvited and curses the infant princess: on her sixteenth birthday, she will prick her finger on the spindle of a spinning wheel and fall into a deep sleep from which she will never awaken. When Stefan begs for mercy, Maleficent mocks him and offers an antidote: the curse can only be broken by true loves kiss. Fearing for his daughters safety, Stefan sends Aurora to live with three pixies—Knotgrass, Thistlewit, and Flittle—until the day after her sixteenth birthday, while he destroys all the spinning wheels in the kingdom and hides their remnants in the castle dungeon. He sends his armies to find and kill Maleficent, but she surrounds the Moors with an impenetrable wall of thorns. King Stefan slips into madness and paranoia, trying to prevent the curse, even neglecting to see his wife on her deathbed.Despite her initial dislike for Aurora, Maleficent begins to care for her when the bumbling and neglectful pixies fail to do so. After a brief meeting with the young Aurora, Maleficent watches over her from afar. When Aurora is fifteen, she encounters Maleficent. Knowing that she is being watched over, she calls Maleficent her ""fairy godmother"". Maleficent tries desperately to undo the curse but is unsuccessful, as the curse proves to be unbreakable by any means other than true loves kiss. In the forest, Aurora meets Prince Philip, and the two are attracted to each other. On the day before Auroras sixteenth birthday, Aurora tells Maleficent that she would like to live with her in the Moors. When Aurora returns to the cottage, the pixies inadvertently tell Aurora of her past. Having learned of Maleficents true identity, Aurora runs to her fathers castle.After a brief reunion with his daughter, Stefan locks her away in a room for her own safety while setting up a plan to kill Maleficent. However, the power of the curse draws Aurora to the dungeon, where a spinning wheel magically reassembles itself. She pricks her finger and falls into a deep sleep, fulfilling the curse. Maleficent, intent on saving Aurora, abducts Phillip and infiltrates Stefans castle, but Phillips kiss fails to awaken Aurora. At her bedside, Maleficent apologizes to Aurora and kisses her forehead. Aurora awakens, as Maleficents motherly feelings towards her count as true love. However, as Maleficent and Aurora attempt to leave, they are ambushed by Stefan and his guards, with an iron net dropping on her. Maleficent transforms Diaval into a dragon, and he battles Stefans guards, but he is eventually caught as well. Stefan taunts Maleficent, who is dizzy and sick from the iron, his former love for her fully gone, but before he can deliver a killing blow, Aurora finds her wings and releases them. They fly to Maleficent and reattach themselves. Maleficent carries Stefan to the top of the castles highest tower and beats him easily and quickly in battle, but cannot bring herself to kill him. Stefan attacks her as she turns away, however, and both plummet entwined from the tower. Maleficent opens her wings and Stefan loses his grip, falling to his death.In the end, Maleficent returns the Moors to its former glory, and Aurora is crowned queen to unify the two kingdoms.",180000000,"[{""id"": 14, ""name"": ""Fantasy""}, {""id"": 12, ""name"": ""Adventure""}, {""id"": 28, ""name"": ""Action""}, {""id"": 10751, ""name"": ""Family""}, {""id"": 10749, ""name"": ""Romance""}]",http://movies.disney.com/maleficent,102651,"[{""id"": 3205, ""name"": ""fairy tale""}, {""id"": 3289, ""name"": ""villain""}, {""id"": 7430, ""name"": ""sleeping beauty""}, {""id"": 177895, ""name"": ""dark fantasy""}, {""id"": 179411, ""name"": ""based on fairy tale""}, {""id"": 186846, ""name"": ""adaptation""}, {""id"": 186847, ""name"": ""retelling""}, {""id"": 186849, ""name"": ""literary adaptation""}, {""id"": 209714, ""name"": ""3d""}]",en,"The untold story of Disney's most iconic villain from the 1959 classic 'Sleeping Beauty'.

Lydia arrives at the hotel room and manages to acquire Nicks fingerprints from a cigarette they share, after his initial resistance to revealing his true identity, going as far as to wipe any surface he touched in the main room to remove fingerprints. Dougherty has them analyzed and discovers that Nick is an ex-policeman, arrested for stealing the $40 million Monarch diamond from businessman David Englander (Ed Harris). Nick was given a 25-year sentence but escaped from the Sing Sing Correctional Facility one month before the main events of the film, after being allowed to attend his fathers funeral. Nick, however, maintains his innocence and accuses Englander of framing him for the theft of the diamond, as Englander lost his fortune and was too proud to sell the diamond.Unknown to the police, Nick is merely distracting them while his brother, Joey (Jamie Bell), and Joeys girlfriend, Angie (Genesis Rodriguez), break into Englanders vault across the street, using the cover of Nicks theatrics to detonate explosives on the roof to gain entry, in order to steal the diamond and ultimately prove Nicks innocence. Cassidy must make use of double entendres in order to provide instructions to Joey and Angie through an earpiece whilst not revealing their plan to the police. Meanwhile, Dougherty informs Marcus of Nicks identity, and Marcus orders the jewelry stores security to check the vault. Joey and Angie are able to evade them by hiding in a ceiling vent, but do not find the diamond. They deliberately set off the heat-sensing alarms, tricking Englander into retrieving the diamond and ambush him in his office, stealing the diamond at gunpoint and forcing him to handcuff himself to his safe. Meanwhile, Nicks ex-partner, Mike Ackerman (Anthony Mackie), arrives at the hotel with evidence that Nick is planning something and demands to be allowed into the hotel room. Lydia does not trust him, and Dougherty backs her up. Ackerman claims he has found bomb schematics in a storage unit Nick rented and is convinced that he will detonate an explosive somewhere. While the crowd is evacuated by the bomb squad, Lydia, believing in Nicks innocence, calls Internal Affairs and discovers that three of the cops employed by Englander were suspected of being corrupt: Ackerman, Marcus, and a deceased officer called Walker, whose name Cassidy uses when checking into the hotel.Joey and Angie enter the hotel and hand the bag containing the diamond to the hotel concierge (William Sadler). The concierge pockets the diamond while placing the bag onto the rack. Englander calls Marcus, one of the corrupt cops who helped him frame Nick, and has him capture Joey and Angie as they reach the street. Nick begins to make his escape through the hotel, with a tactical team in hot pursuit, at one point being aided by the concierge who tells him ""everyone is rooting for you, kid,"" while handing him a disguise, with the diamond hidden in one of the pockets. Marcus chases Nick to the roof, where he has Lydia arrested for obstruction, removing her from the rooftop to allow him to deal with Nick alone. Englander brings Joey and Angie, threatening to throw Joey off the roof if Nick does not give him the diamond. Nick turns it over, under protests from Joey, and Englander leaves. Meanwhile, Lydia escapes custody whilst in an elevator and rushes back to the roof. Marcus attempts to force Nick to jump off the roof, but Ackerman arrives and shoots Marcus, who wounds Ackerman. Nick rushes to Ackermans side, who apologizes and reveals that he had no idea that Englander would frame Nick for stealing the diamond. Marcus survives, as he is wearing a bulletproof vest, and is preparing to kill Nick, when Lydia shoots him, but does not kill him. Seeing Englander leaving the area, mocking him with a wave, Nick jumps from the roof onto an airbag set up earlier by the police, catches up to Englander, beats him with the assistance of a crowd member, and pulls the diamond he had only just recently given him from his jacket, proving Nicks innocence in front of both the police and public, resulting in Englander being arrested.Later, Nick is cleared of all charges and released from custody and meets Joey, Angie, and Lydia at a bar owned by Nicks father, where it is revealed that the bartender, also the hotel concierge, is in fact Nick and Joeys father, Frank Cassidy, who is Nick and Joeys father who had faked his own death in order to allow Nick, his son, to break out of prison under the guise of attending his fathers (Frank Cassidys) funeral, and prove his innocence. Lydia at this point in the film asks Nick to ""explain everything"" to her before Joey proposes to Angie with a diamond ring presumably stolen from Englanders vault. She accepts and they all celebrate together.",42000000,"[{""id"": 28, ""name"": ""Action""}, {""id"": 53, ""name"": ""Thriller""}, {""id"": 80, ""name"": ""Crime""}]",http://www.manonaledge.com/,49527,"[{""id"": 9758, ""name"": ""deception""}, {""id"": 14512, ""name"": ""new york city""}, {""id"": 15219, ""name"": ""rooftop""}, {""id"": 40903, ""name"": ""diamond heist""}, {""id"": 157210, ""name"": ""framed for a crime""}, {""id"": 169271, ""name"": ""escaped prisoner""}, {""id"": 209140, ""name"": ""negotiator""}]",en,"An ex-cop turned con threatens to jump to his death from a Manhattan hotel rooftop.

398,399,Margin Call,2011,/wiki/Margin_Call_(film),"An investment bank begins a mass layoff on the trading floor during a normal business day. Among those let go is Eric Dale (Stanley Tucci), head of risk management. Dale tries to speak about his current, unfinished project, first with human resources staff and then with desk head Will Emerson (Paul Bettany), but is told that this is no longer his concern. While being escorted out of the building he meets one of his risk analysts, Peter Sullivan (Zachary Quinto), and gives him a USB stick to look at with a vague instruction to ""be careful.""Sullivan works late that night to finish Dales project, and discovers that current volatility in the firms portfolio of mortgage-backed securities has exceeded the historical volatility levels of the positions. Because of excessive leverage, if the firms assets decrease by 25%, the loss will be greater than the value of the firm itself and the firm will go bankrupt. Sullivan and his colleague, junior analyst Seth Bregman (Badgley), tell Emerson about the situation. Emerson alerts floor head Sam Rogers (Spacey), who also returns to the office. They attempt to contact Dale, but the company shut off his phone and he hadnt yet returned home.They have emergency meetings in the middle of the night with division head Jared Cohen (Baker), chief risk management officer Sarah Robertson (Moore), and other senior executives to discuss their options.  Finally CEO John Tuld (Jeremy Irons) is called in. Cohens plan is for the firm to quickly dump all of the toxic assets in a fire sale before the market learns of their worthlessness, thereby limiting the firms exposure, a plan favored by Tuld. Rogers protests that dumping the firms toxic assets will spread the risk throughout the financial sector and destroy the firms relationships with its counterparties, as well as cripple the market for the foreseeable future. He also warns Cohen that their customers will quickly learn of the firms plans once they realize that the firm is only selling the toxic securities, but is not buying any new ones.They finally locate Dale back at his home in Brooklyn, and Will is able to convince him to return to the office, informing him that the firm will not pay him his severance and other benefits unless he agrees to participate in their plan. Will also tells Seth hell probably lose his job in the crisis, but will get a large severance, while explaining to him the amoral, cyclical nature of the markets. Meanwhile, it is revealed that Robertson, Cohen, and Tuld were aware of the risks in the weeks leading up to the crisis. Tuld offers Robertson up as the scapegoat, putting the blame of the crisis on her and forcing her resignation. Both Dale and Robertson are instructed to remain in the office all day and do nothing in return for an increase to their severance packages. Robertson expresses regret for not doing more to stop the crisis.Before morning, Tuld is able to convince Rogers to go along with Cohens plan. In a speech to his traders in preparation for the fire sale, Rogers warns them that, by participating, they are effectively ruining their reputations and ending their careers in the industry, but offers a $1.4 million dollar bonus to those able to sell 93% of their assigned securities, with further $1.3 million dollar bonuses if the entire sales floor can reach 93% as a whole. As the trading bell sounds and the markets open, Emerson and the traders immediately begin rapidly selling off their securities, and quickly arouse suspicion and anger from their buyers as the hours pass, and by closing bell the firm takes tremendous losses while dumping positions for cents on the dollar, but is able to successfully sell off all the toxic assets. After trading hours end, Cohen tells Rogers there will be another round of layoffs, but Rogers will keep his job. Angry that he was retained, Rogers confronts Tuld in the executive dining room, telling him that he wants to cash in on his options and severance pay and leave the company, but Tuld dismisses his protests, claiming that the current crisis is no different from various bear markets of the past, and that sharp gains and losses are simply part of the economic cycle. He persuades Rogers to stay at the firm for another two years, promising that there will be a lot of money to be made from the coming crisis. Cohen is seen bringing Sullivan into the dining room, and Tuld informs Rogers he is promoting Sullivan. Rogers reluctantly accepts Tulds deal, but says its only because he needs the money.Rogers buries his dog in his ex-wifes front yard in the middle of the night, and learns from her that their sons financial firm took a big hit but survived the days trading.The screen cuts to black and the credits roll as the sound of Rogers shoveling dirt continues.",3500000,"[{""id"": 53, ""name"": ""Thriller""}, {""id"": 18, ""name"": ""Drama""}]",http://www.margincallmovie.com/,50839,"[{""id"": 592, ""name"": ""capitalism""}, {""id"": 4608, ""name"": ""brokerage""}, {""id"": 5636, ""name"": ""wall street""}, {""id"": 33471, ""name"": ""downsizing""}, {""id"": 165193, ""name"": ""financial crisis""}, {""id"": 177493, ""name"": ""stock market""}, {""id"": 187243, ""name"": ""stock market crash""}, {""id"": 209493, ""name"": ""21st century""}, {""id"": 221004, ""name"": ""investment""}]",en,A thriller that revolves around the key people at an investment bank over a 24-hour period during the early stages of the financial crisis.,26.259389,"[{""name"": ""Benaroya Pictures"", ""id"": 6692}, {""name"": ""Before the Door Pictures"", ""id"": 14861}, {""name"": ""Washington Square Films"", ""id"": 14862}, {""name"": ""Untitled Entertainment"", ""id"": 46225}]","[{""iso_3166_1"": ""US"", ""name"": ""United States of America""}]",9/28/2011,19504039,107,"[{""iso_639_1"": ""en"", ""name"": ""English""}]",Released,Be first.

399,400,Marmaduke,2010,/wiki/Marmaduke_(film),"Marmaduke, a Great Dane, lives in rural Kansas with his best friend, a cat named Carlos. His owners, Phil and Debbie Winslow, work for Bark Organic dog food. Phil is very strict, from Marmadukes perspective. Phil is transferred to Orange County, California. Phils boss, Don Twombly, wants to sell Bark Organic in nation-wide Petco stores. Phil and Don meet at the dog park to discuss Phils assignment, an ad campaign to win over Petco. There, Marmaduke meets Mazie, who develops a crush on Marmaduke. He also meets Giuseppe, a Chinese Crested dog who is afraid of everything, and Raisin, a very smart but minute Dachshund.Later, Marmaduke meets a Rough Collie named Jezebel, whose boyfriend is Bosco, a violent Beauceron with two Miniature Pinscher minions named Thunder and Lightning. Bosco intimidates Marmaduke, who does not want to fight. Marmaduke and the mutts get together at night and crash Boscos pedigrees-only party, only to be scared away. Marmaduke asks Mazie to help him get a girl, whom she presumes is herself but is Jezebel.Marmaduke has Carlos pretend to be lost in the dog park, and the two stage a fight in front of all the dogs to boost Marmadukes popularity. Marmaduke enters a dog surfing contest put together as a promotional stunt by Phil to sway Petco and beats Bosco, who is the reigning dog-surfing champion. They get into a fight, which appalls the Petco executives. As a result, Phil hires a dog trainer named Anton to help him control Marmaduke, albeit with little success.Marmaduke takes Jezebel on Mazies dream date, which the latter watches from afar. While the Winslow family are on Dons boat, Marmaduke throws a party; most residents of the dog park attend, save for Mazie, Giuseppe, and Raisin. Bosco crashes the party and discovers it was Carlos at the dog park. He exposes Marmaduke, who loses his friends. When the Winslows return and Phil discovers the house in a wreck, he locks Marmaduke outside. Marmaduke runs away and leaves Mazie a toy she had given him earlier. Mazie goes to Marmadukes house, and Carlos tells her Marmaduke never returned. As she looks for him, Marmaduke meets Chupadogra, a wise, elderly English Mastiff who is feared for presumably eating his owner. In reality, he ran away to lead a pack, but they abandoned him. He has spent the time alone in the woods with nothing but a blanket and his old water bowl, which reads ""Buster"". Buster tells Marmaduke to return to his family while he still has one and distracts a dog catcher. Marmaduke leaves but gets lost.In the morning, the Winslows discover Marmaduke missing and search for him. Mazie and the family find him simultaneously on the streets, but Mazie falls into a subterranean rainwater conduit after the street below her collapses. Marmaduke jumps in after her; Phil and the fire department attempt to retrieve him. The fireman saves Mazie but loses Marmaduke in the raging water. By this time, Phil has been fired for missing his last chance meeting with Petco. He follows the aqueduct and finds Marmaduke in the raging waters. Phil begs Marmaduke to let go of the branch he is holding onto and let the waters carry him to Phil. He reluctantly does and is saved. Several kids record it on video and put it on YouTube. When it proves popular, Phil is rehired and Petco stocks Bark Organic. Phil discusses moving back to Kansas, but the Winslow family wants to stay in California.Marmaduke convinces the pedigrees to share the park, and they turn on Bosco, who leaves, after revealing his fear of bees (which Marmaduke also fears). Meanwhile, Phil and Don think of new commercials while considering whether dogs can talk to each other or dance.

400,401,Mars Needs Moms,2011,/wiki/Mars_Needs_Moms,"Unbeknownst to humans, there is a thriving, technologically sophisticated society of Martians living below the surface of Mars. The Martians Supervisor, while observing Earth, sees a mother persuading her son, Milo, to do his chores. The Martians decide to bring her to Mars, where her ""momness"" will be extracted and implanted into the next generation of nannybots. Meanwhile, Milo, who doesnt like following the house rules and doing chores, tells his mother in anger that his life would be better without her, breaking her heart.Later that night, Milo goes to apologize, but discovers his mom is being abducted. He runs after her, but they end up in separate parts of the Martian spaceship.  On Mars, Milo is taken to an underground cell. He escapes and is chased by Martian guards, but he follows a voice that tells him to jump down a chute, and lands in a lower subterranean level. There, he sees a trash-covered landscape that is inhabited by furry creatures.Milo is whisked away by the creatures to meet Gribble, a.k.a. George Ribble, the childlike adult human who had told him to jump down the chute.  Gribble explains to Milo that the Martians plan to extract Milos Moms memories at sunrise, using a process that will kill her. Gribble, who is lonely and doesnt want Milo to leave, pretends to help Milo rescue his mother, but his plan goes awry leading to Gribble being captured and Milo being pursued by Martian guards.Milo is rescued by Ki, one of the supervisors who raise Martian babies.

Milo is captured by the guards, but Ki tosses him a laser gun, allowing him to escape.Milo and Gribble retreat to an even lower uninhabited level, where, Gribble explains his Moms abduction and murder by the Martians 20 years ago. Gribble blames himself for her being chosen, and regrets that he hadnt been able to save her. Milo convinces Gribble to actually help him just as Ki finds them. They discover an ancient mural of a Martian family and realize that Martian children werent always raised by machines.

This lets the adult males and babies enter, where they run amok, attacking the guards and robots.Milo and his Mom steal oxygen helmets and try to escape across the Martian surface, but the Supervisor causes Milo to trip and his helmet shatters.

402,403,Me Before You,2016,/wiki/Me_Before_You_(film),"Louisa Clark (Emilia Clarke) is a happy, outgoing woman who lives with and supports her working-class family. After losing her job at a local cafe, she is hired as a companion for Will Traynor (Sam Claflin), a former successful banker and once active young man who became paralyzed after being involved in a motorcycle accident two years prior. Louisa has no experience, but Wills mother believes her cheery personality will help lift his spirits. Will only spends time with his nurse Nathan (Steve Peacocke), who knows that he will never regain use of his body due to the damage to his spinal cord. Nathan assists him with everything physical like movement, exercise, and clothing.Cynical and depressed because he can no longer live an active life, Will initially reacts coldly to Louisas upbeat demeanor and treats her with contempt. After two weeks, Will has a visit from his former best friend Rupert and ex-girlfriend Alicia, who reveal that they are engaged. Will manages to smash all the photographs on his dresser in anger and indignation, which Louisa tries to repair the next day, leading to a verbal altercation between the two. The next day, Will asks Louisa to watch a film with subtitles with him, and she accepts. The two begin to bond and eventually become close friends. Louisa and Will continue to talk daily; she learns that he is cultured and worldly, having traveled extensively. In contrast, her life so far has been simple, without many interests or hobbies or travel away from home. Her long-term boyfriend, Patrick (Matthew Lewis), is training to take part in a Viking triathlon in Norway, a hobby that he often chooses over spending time with her. Will urges Louisa to broaden her horizons and tells her that its her responsibility to live her life as fully as possible.While Nathan takes care of Will during one of his occasional illnesses, Louisa notices Wills scarred wrists from a previous suicide attempt. Sometime after, Louisa overhears an argument between Wills parents, and she learns that Will has given his parents six months before checking in to Dignitas in Switzerland for assisted suicide. Will refuses to accept life with a disability that entails dependency, pain, and suffering without any hope for recovery of his old self. Louisa then takes it upon herself to change his mind. She organizes various trips and adventures to show Will that life is worth living, despite his disability. Will gradually becomes more communicative and open to her plans. Louisa, Will, and Nathan attend horse racing, a trip far from perfect. Nonetheless, Louisa sways Will into attending a Mozart concert. Will then decides to attend Alicias wedding and asks Louisa to accompany him. At the wedding, Louisa and Will enjoy offending the straight-laced guests. Louisa learns from the brides godmother that she considers Will to be Alicias ""one that got away"".Will joins Louisas family for dinner on her birthday, where they learn that Louisas father had lost his job in a leveraged buyout that happened to have been organized by a younger associate of Will. Shortly thereafter, Louisas father is offered the head of maintenance job at Stortfold Castle, which belongs to Wills family, and Louisa realizes that Will is trying to help her secure her freedom from her family. Gradually they develop strong feelings for one another, which makes Patrick jealous and causes problems in Louisas long-standing relationship, eventually leading to their break-up.During a luxurious trip to the island of Mauritius together, undertaken after another bout with pneumonia and with help from Nathan, Will informs Louisa that he still intends to follow through with the euthanasia. He wants her to live a full life instead of ""half a life"" with him. He says their time together has been special, but he cannot bear to live in a wheelchair. He asks her to accompany him to Switzerland to be with him through his last moments. Heartbroken, she informs Wills parents upon arrival in London that she is quitting immediately and travels back to her home by bus. She does not speak to Will for the days that follow. However, at home, Louisas father convinces her to go to Will.

403,404,Meet the Fockers,2010,/wiki/Meet_the_Fockers,"Set two years after the events of the first film, Gaylord ""Greg"" Focker (Ben Stiller) and his fiancée Pam Byrnes (Teri Polo) decide to introduce their parents to each other. They first fly to Oyster Bay, New York, on Long Island, to pick up Pams father, retired CIA operative Jack Byrnes (Robert De Niro), her mother Dina (Blythe Danner) and one-year-old nephew Little Jack (the son of Bob and Debbie Banks). But rather than going to the airport as planned, Jack decides to drive the family to Miami to meet the Fockers in his new RV.Once they arrive, they are greeted by Gregs eccentric but fun-loving and amiable father, Bernie (Dustin Hoffman), and mother, Roz (Barbra Streisand), who is a sex therapist for elderly couples. Concerned that Jack might be put off by the Fockers lifestyle, Greg convinces Roz to pretend that she is a yoga instructor for the weekend. However, small cracks begin to form between Jack and the Fockers, due to their contrasting personalities. The meet gets off to a bad start when a chase between the Fockers sexually active dog, Moses, and the Byrness cat, Jinx, culminates with Jinx flushing Moses down the RVs toilet, forcing Bernie to destroy it to save Moses. Later, Bernie accidentally injures Jacks back during a game of football.Meanwhile, Pam informs Greg that shes pregnant, and the two decide to keep it secret from Jack. Jack again becomes suspicious of Gregs character when they are introduced to the Fockers housekeeper, Isabel Villalobos (Alanna Ubach), with whom Bernie reveals Greg had a sexual affair fifteen years before. Jack later takes the RV to Isabels 15-year-old son, Jorge (Ray Santiago), to fix the toilet, but is disturbed by Jorges striking resemblance to Greg, and the fact that Jorge never met his father, and jumps to the conclusion that he might be Gregs son with Isabel. Meanwhile, Roz, Bernie and Dina realize Pam is pregnant, but promise not to tell Jack. Growing envious of Bernie and Rozs active sex life, Dina consults Roz on sex tips in order to seduce Jack, but none of them works.Greg and Jacks relationship is again put to the test when Greg is left alone to babysit Little Jack, whom Jack has been raising via the Ferber method. Despite Jacks strict instructions to leave Little Jack to self-soothe, Greg is unable to stand listening to Little Jacks cries and tends to the boy to cheer him up by hugging him, putting Elmos World on TV, and acting funny, but inadvertently teaches him the word ""asshole."" Disaster strikes when Greg answers a brief phone call from Roz, which is long enough for Little Jack to wander out of his playpen (which Jinx had opened), put on Scarface, and glue his hands to a bottle of rum. After a furious argument with the Fockers and his own family (though amends are quickly made), Jack resumes his spying on Greg and sends Greg and Jorges hair samples for a DNA test, while inviting Jorge to the Fockers planned engagement party in the hope of getting Greg to admit he is Jorges father. At the engagement party, Jack, who automatically assumes that Greg knew about Jorge and has deliberately been keeping him a secret from Pam, introduces Greg to Jorge. Later, when Greg denies knowing anything about Jorge, Jack still refuses to believe him and drugs him with truth serum to make him talk. On stage, Greg uncontrollably blurts out that Pam is pregnant and that Jorge is his son in a Darth Vader-esqe matter before immediately losing consciousness.The next morning, Pam questions Greg about Jorge, and Greg does not confirm or deny that he is Jorges father, but insists that he knew nothing about him before the previous evening. Pam believes him, and is willing to work things out with him. Jack reaches his breaking point with Gregs dishonesty and demands that Pam and Dina leave the island with him. Dina refuses and reveals Jacks actions to everyone. Everyone turns against Jack, with Pam announcing her intent to marry Greg regardless of him having Jorge with Isabel, and Dina admits that they were all aware of Pams pregnancy. A shocked and hurt Jack leaves with his grandson.Bernie and Greg pursue Jack, but are soon tasered and arrested by an overzealous deputy sheriff, Vern LeFlore (Tim Blake Nelson), for speeding and refusing to remain in their car. Meanwhile, Jack is informed that Greg is not Jorges father (his real father turns out to be a baseball player who also resembles Greg), and attempts to defend Greg and Bernie, but the overzealous Leflore tasers and arrests him, too. In their cell, Greg, Jack, and Bernie are released by the local judge, Ira (Shelley Berman), who is a client of Roz and a close friend of the Fockers. Before they leave, Greg asks that Jack and Bernie stop their feud. Jack admits that he made a mistake regarding Jorge and reveals his past career in the CIA to Bernie, before apologizing for his actions and making up with the two of them.Greg and Pam are married that weekend by Pams ex-fiancé, Kevin (Owen Wilson), who is now an ordained interfaith minister. During the party, Jack asks Roz for some sex tips and sneaks into the RV with Dina.During the post-credit scene, Jack watches hidden baby-cam footage of the Fockers giving attention to Little Jack over Jacks previous objections: Roz gives Little Jack chocolate, Bernie advises him to use his crying to disagree with everything Jack says, and Greg pretends to drunkenly tell Little Jack to keep it a secret that he left to smoke pot, not answer the phone, when he left Little Jack unattended and that Pam is not really pregnant and only said it so that Jack would let them get married. Greg then pretends to only just discover the camera but then after making teasing gestures at it, Greg reveals that he knew about it all along and none of the things he said before was true.",80000000,"[{""id"": 35, ""name"": ""Comedy""}, {""id"": 10749, ""name"": ""Romance""}]",http://www.meetthefockers.com/index.php,693,"[{""id"": 591, ""name"": ""cia""}, {""id"": 970, ""name"": ""parents kids relationship""}, {""id"": 1196, ""name"": ""florida""}, {""id"": 2088, ""name"": ""anti-authoritarian upbringing""}, {""id"": 2606, ""name"": ""jew""}, {""id"": 3453, ""name"": ""parents-in-law""}, {""id"": 3454, ""name"": ""orderly""}, {""id"": 3455, ""name"": ""just married""}, {""id"": 3456, ""name"": ""sex therapy""}, {""id"": 6188, ""name"": ""bad father-in-law""}, {""id"": 18035, ""name"": ""family""}, {""id"": 183886, ""name"": ""illegitimate son""}]",en,"Hard-to-crack ex-CIA man, Jack Byrnes and his wife, Dina head for the warmer climes of Florida to meet son-in-law-to-be, Greg Focker's parents.

404,405,Megamind,2010,/wiki/Megamind,"Ever since they arrived on Earth as infants, supervillain Megamind has fought superhero Metro Man for dominance of Metro City. In his latest plan, Megamind and his sidekick Minion kidnap reporter Roxanne Ritchi and hold her hostage in a copper-lined observatory. When Metro Man arrives to save her, he reveals he is weakened by copper, and Megamind obliterates him with a death ray. Megamind finally takes control of the city, but his celebration is short-lived as without Metro Man to challenge him, he finds his life has no meaning.While wandering the recently-opened Metro Man Museum, Megamind sees Roxanne nearby, and uses his holographic disguise watch to take the form of Bernard, the museums curator, whom he had ""dehydrated"" into a small cube. He talks to Roxanne and becomes attracted to her, and is inspired by one of her statements to create a new superhero for him to fight. Megamind returns to his lair and creates a serum containing Metro Mans DNA which he plans to inject into a proper candidate with his Defuser Gun. However, Roxannes arrival at his lair with her dimwitted cameraman Hal Stewart causes Megamind to inadvertently inject Hal with the serum. Megamind disguises himself as Hals ""Space Dad"" and convinces him to become the superhero ""Titan"". Titan spends several days training with his Space Dad before issuing a challenge to fight Megamind.On the day before the fight, Megamind gets into an argument with Minion, and Titan tries and fails to woo Roxanne. Megamind, disguised as Bernard, takes Roxanne on a dinner date. Titan sees them, and as he had been infatuated with Roxanne, becomes upset and leaves. Shortly thereafter, Megaminds disguise fails, revealing his identity to Roxanne, who also storms off. The situation leaves him unable to find his invisible car, which is where he left the Defuser Gun he used to inject the serum into Hal.Titan does not arrive at the scheduled fight, and Megamind finds that he has used his abilities for criminal purposes. As ""Space Dad"" and ""Bernard"" Megamind successfully convinces Titan to fight him as Titan realizes Megamind has used him and ""taken"" Roxanne from him. Titan engages in a super-powered fight with Megamind. However, when Titan wants to kill him instead of arrest him, Megamind lures Titan into a copper-lined trap, but he is unaffected and continues to fight. Megamind escapes from the battle and seeks out Roxanne, hoping she can help. She offers to take him to Metro Mans secret headquarters, where they are both surprised to find Metro Man alive. Metro Man faked his death and weakness to copper, as he had become tired of being a superhero and wanted to retire to become a music star. He declines to help, but offers Megamind the advice that a hero will always rise up to challenge evil.Returning to the city, Megamind does not believe he can become the hero the city needs, and allows himself to be locked up in prison. Titan kidnaps Roxanne and demands Megamind show himself or he will kill her. Megamind has a change of heart and pleads with the prison warden, apologizing for his past actions. The warden reveals himself to be Minion in disguise, accepting Megaminds apology, and frees him so they can fight Hal.As Hal is about to kill Roxanne, Megamind appears and frees her. The two escape, but Hal traps Megamind under rubble and threatens to kill him when Metro Man suddenly arrives, and Hal flees. Roxanne discovers that ""Megamind"" is really an injured Minion in disguise, while ""Metro Man"" is Megamind. Hal, in his flight, recognizes Megaminds distinctive mispronunciations, and realizes he was duped. Hal flies back and fights Megamind, during which Megamind finds his invisible car. He grabs the Defuser Gun and is able to extract the Metro Man serum from Titan, restoring him to normal. Now hailed as heroes, Megamind and Minion appear at the reopening of Metro Mans museum, now dedicated to Megamind instead, while Metro Man, in disguise within the crowd, silently congratulates his former rival.In a mid-credits scene Minion is doing the laundry when a re-hydrated Bernard pops out of the washing machine.",130000000,"[{""id"": 16, ""name"": ""Animation""}, {""id"": 28, ""name"": ""Action""}, {""id"": 35, ""name"": ""Comedy""}, {""id"": 10751, ""name"": ""Family""}, {""id"": 878, ""name"": ""Science Fiction""}]",http://www.megamind.com,38055,"[{""id"": 83, ""name"": ""saving the world""}, {""id"": 248, ""name"": ""date""}, {""id"": 378, ""name"": ""prison""}, {""id"": 1308, ""name"": ""secret identity""}, {""id"": 1357, ""name"": ""fish""}, {""id"": 1419, ""name"": ""gun""}, {""id"": 1718, ""name"": ""dna""}, {""id"": 1919, ""name"": ""mayor""}, {""id"": 2095, ""name"": ""anti hero""}, {""id"": 2217, ""name"": ""rain""}, {""id"": 2598, ""name"": ""museum""}, {""id"": 4127, ""name"": ""one-sided love""}, {""id"": 8803, ""name"": ""serum""}, {""id"": 11477, ""name"": ""talking animal""}, {""id"": 12193, ""name"": ""reporter""}, {""id"": 179431, ""name"": ""duringcreditsstinger""}, {""id"": 219826, ""name"": ""stronger villain""}]",en,"Bumbling supervillain Megamind finally defeats his nemesis, the superhero Metro Man.

405,406,Men in Black 3,2012,/wiki/Men_in_Black_3,"In 2012, an alien criminal named Boris the Animal, a Boglodite, escapes from a maximum-security prison on the Moon and arrives on Earth, bent on taking revenge on Agent K, who shot off his left arm and captured him in 1969. He confronts K, who is with his partner Agent J, telling him he is ""already dead"". J then returns to MiB Headquarters and discovers that K was responsible not only for capturing Boris, but for deploying the ""ArcNet"", a shield that prevented the Boglodites from conquering Earth and caused their extinction.Boris travels back in time to kill the young Agent K. With history altered so that K is long-dead, J finds that only his memory has been unaffected, and no one from the Agency understands his obsession with K until Agent O, the new Chief, deduces that there has been a fracture in the space-time continuum. With K out of the picture, the ArcNet was never deployed, and there is nothing to protect the present-day Earth from the Boglodite invasion, so J must travel back in time to stop Boris and save K.Back in 1969, J goes to Coney Island, knowing from the Agencys records that in 1969, Boris will commit a murder there. He finds Boris, but is arrested by 1969 K, who takes him to MiB Headquarters and prepares to neuralyze him, but decides at the last minute to investigate Js claims that he has traveled from the future to protect him. K and J follow clues, leading them to a bowling alley, and then to The Factory, where they come across an alien named Griffin, who is in possession of the ArcNet. Griffin, who can see all possible future timelines and outcomes, senses Boris is coming and flees, promising to give them the ArcNet the next time they meet. Boris later captures Griffin. J and K pursue and rescue Griffin, acquiring the ArcNet. 1969 Boris escapes and 2012 Boris arrives, and they team up.Upon learning that they must go to Cape Canaveral, Florida and attach the ArcNet to the Apollo 11 rocket so it can be deployed in space, J reveals the real purpose of his mission to K, who initially takes the news badly. J, K, and Griffin fly there using jetpacks, but are stopped by the military. Griffin shows a skeptical colonel the future, convincing him of the importance of their mission, and the officer assists them in reaching the launch site. As the agents climb up the rockets launch tower, they are attacked by both 1969 Boris and 2012 Boris. Using his time-travel device, J evades an attack by 2012 Boris and knocks him off one of the launch tower bridges. K shoots off 1969 Boriss left arm, knocking him off the tower as well. The ArcNet is attached and deploys successfully when the rocket launches, with 2012 Boris being incinerated by the rockets exhaust, killing him. 1969 Boris attacks K on a beach, but the colonel saves K by sacrificing himself. K kills Boris instead of arresting him as he originally did. The colonels young son arrives and inquires about his father, but rather than tell him the truth, K neuralyzes him and tells him only that his father is a hero. Observing from afar, J realizes that the young boy is himself, the colonel was his father, and that K has been watching over him all his life and was there when the timeline changed, thus explaining why he was the only one who remembered K in the alternate 2012.With his mission complete, J returns to 2012, where he reconciles with K. Griffin observes this, and says it is his new favorite moment in human history.",225000000,"[{""id"": 28, ""name"": ""Action""}, {""id"": 35, ""name"": ""Comedy""}, {""id"": 878, ""name"": ""Science Fiction""}]",http://www.sonypictures.com/movies/meninblack3/,41154,"[{""id"": 4379, ""name"": ""time travel""}, {""id"": 5455, ""name"": ""time machine""}, {""id"": 9951, ""name"": ""alien""}, {""id"": 174915, ""name"": ""fictional government agency""}, {""id"": 185668, ""name"": ""seeing the future""}, {""id"": 208756, ""name"": ""changing history""}]",en,"Agents J (Will Smith) and K (Tommy Lee Jones) are back...in time.

406,407,Men in Black II,2012,/wiki/Men_in_Black_II,"Five years after the retirement of Agent K and the defeat of Edgar the Bug from Men in Black, the secret New York City-based agency that monitors and regulates extraterrestrial life residing on Earth, Agent J–Ks former partner and hand-picked replacement–is called to investigate the murder of an alien, Ben, at his pizzeria. The waitress, Laura Vasquez, tells him that the murderers are Serleena, a shapeshifting, plant-like Kylothian who has taken the form of a lingerie model, and her two-headed servant Scrad. Laura says they were looking for something called the Light of Zartha. J is strongly attracted to Laura, and in violation of MiB rules, does not neuralyze her to erase her memories.J finds that little is known about the Light of Zartha, except that it is immensely powerful. As he investigates the crime, every lead points to his mentor, Agent K, who was neuralyzed upon retirement and remembers nothing of his MiB service. In Truro, Massachusetts, where K is now the towns postmaster, J convinces him by proving that all of his fellow postal workers are aliens. Back in New York City, Serleena and Scrad launch an attack on MiB headquarters before Ks neuralyzation can be reversed, but Jack Jeebs, an old friend of Agent J, has an illegal deneuralyzer in his basement. K regains his memories, but remembers that years before, he neuralyzed himself specifically to erase what he knew of the Light of Zartha, and those memories have not returned. As a precaution, he left himself a series of clues.At the pizzeria, they find a locker key. J hides Laura, who fears for her safety, with worm aliens. The key opens a locker in Grand Central Station where a society of tiny aliens, who worship K as their deity, guard their most sacred relics: Ks wristwatch and video store membership card. At the video store, as J and K watch a fictionalized story of the Light of Zartha, K remembers the Zarthan Queen Laurana long ago entrusted Men in Black with safeguarding the Light from her nemesis, Serleena, who followed Laurana to Earth and killed her. After hiding the Light, K neuralyzed himself to ensure that he would never reveal its hiding place. K still cannot remember where he hid it, nor what the Light actually looks like; he only remembers that it must return to Zartha soon, or both Earth and Zartha will be destroyed.At the worms apartment, they find that Laura has been kidnapped by Serleena, who believes that Lauras bracelet is the Light. J, K, and the worms counterattack MiB headquarters, freeing Laura and the other agents. Serleena attempts to retaliate by chasing them with a spaceship through New York but is eaten by Jeff, a gigantic worm alien living in the New York City Subway.Lauras bracelet leads J and K to the roof of a skyscraper where a ship stands ready to transport the Light back to Zartha. The two realize Laura is the daughter of Laurana, and is herself the Light. K convinces J and Laura that she must go to Zartha, to save both her planet and Earth from destruction. Serleena, who has assimilated Jeff and taken his form, attempts to snatch the ship carrying Laura as it lifts off, but J and K blast her out of the sky. Since all of New York City has just witnessed this battle in the skies over the metropolis, K activates a giant neuralyzer in the torch of the Statue of Liberty.Back at headquarters, K and Men in Black Chief Zed, hoping to cheer up a heartbroken J, have relocated the tiny locker-dwelling aliens who worship him to his Men in Black locker. When J suggests showing the miniature creatures that their universe is bigger than a locker, K shows J that the human universe is itself a locker within an immense alien train station.",140000000,"[{""id"": 28, ""name"": ""Action""}, {""id"": 12, ""name"": ""Adventure""}, {""id"": 35, ""name"": ""Comedy""}, {""id"": 878, ""name"": ""Science Fiction""}]",http://www.sonypictures.com/homevideo/meninblackii/,608,"[{""id"": 83, ""name"": ""saving the world""}, {""id"": 1308, ""name"": ""secret identity""}, {""id"": 1381, ""name"": ""sun glasses""}, {""id"": 1568, ""name"": ""undercover""}, {""id"": 1826, ""name"": ""space marine""}, {""id"": 2173, ""name"": ""illegal immigration""}, {""id"": 2428, ""name"": ""deportation""}, {""id"": 2547, ""name"": ""new identity""}, {""id"": 3243, ""name"": ""flying saucer""}, {""id"": 3760, ""name"": ""light""}, {""id"": 6112, ""name"": ""firearm""}, {""id"": 9951, ""name"": ""alien""}, {""id"": 174915, ""name"": ""fictional government agency""}]",en,"Kay and Jay reunite to provide our best, last and only line of defense against a sinister seductress who levels the toughest challenge yet to the MIB's untarnished mission statement – protecting Earth from the scum of the universe.

407,408,Midnight Special,2016,/wiki/Midnight_Special_(film),"In a motel, Roy Tomlin (Michael Shannon) and his friend Lucas (Joel Edgerton) watch an AMBER Alert for 8-year-old Alton Meyer (Jaeden Lieberher) and his reported abductor, Roy, while the boy reads on the floor.At the Ranch, a religious cult in rural Texas, Pastor Calvin Meyer (Sam Shepard) dispatches two of his parishioners (Bill Camp and Scott Haze) to retrieve Alton. He then faces his congregation as the FBI storms their church. NSA communications analyst Paul Sevier (Adam Driver) asks Calvin how numbers sent via encoded satellite transmissions made their way into his sermons. Calvin explains that Alton speaks in tongues and gave the numbers to Calvin. As Altons powers grew, his mother Sarah (Kirsten Dunst) abandoned him, and members of the Ranch have been raising him, with Pastor Meyer as his adoptive father. It is also noted in this sequence that Roy is Altons biological father.After a violent confrontation with a state trooper, Roy and Lucas seek cover at the home of Elden (David Jansen), a former Ranch member. During the night, an earthquake seems to wake Roy and Lucas. When they break down the door to Altons room, they find him linked to Elden by blinding beams of light directly from his eyes into Eldens. Roy knocks out Elden and covers up Alton, who is extremely photosensitive. They take Eldens van and continue on toward a location that Alton specified. Members of the Ranch seem to know this location, but the FBI is desperately trying to figure out where the trio are headed.When they stop at a gas station, Alton seems to destroy a satellite, creating a rain of debris crashing down on them. They drive to Sarah Tomlins house, and she is overjoyed to be reunited with her son. After they watch the news together, Alton explains that he caused the satellite to crash because the police were using it to track him. As the fugitives, now including Sarah, continue their trek, Alton appears to be growing sick and weak. He convinces Roy to let him see the daylight, while Lucas and Sarah go ahead to a motel. After witnessing his first sunrise, Altons eyes begin to glow, and an enormous dome of light surrounds the duo. They reunite with Lucas and Sarah, and Alton is healthy. He explains that seeing the sun helped him realize his true identity. He explains that there is a world ""built on top of"" this one, and that he belongs to it. Roy confirms that he briefly saw this hidden world inside the dome of light.When they leave the hotel room, they are ambushed by Calvins trackers from the ranch, who abduct Alton but are soon captured by the police. The boy is taken to a government facility where he insists that he will only talk to Sevier. After Sevier experiences Altons powers, he helps reunite him with his parents. Having deduced their destination from Calvins sermons, Sevier warns the fugitives that there is a 5-mile security perimeter around the location, on the Florida panhandle.Roy barrels through a roadblock, driving inside the perimeter as the Army scrambles to chase them. Alton and Sarah exit the car and run into the woods. Roy and Lucas lead the Army on a wild goose chase while Alton and Sarah reach the edge of a swamp. There, Alton creates a dome of light that engulfs much of Florida and surrounding states; everyone inside it can see the futuristic structures of a parallel world. Eventually, other beings of this world gather around Alton, and the entire dome disappears, taking Alton with it.Roy and Lucas are arrested. Lucas is interviewed by the FBI.

408,409,Million Dollar Arm,2014,/wiki/Million_Dollar_Arm,"J. B. Bernstein is a big-time sports agent who, along with his partner Ash Vasudevan, recently formed their own company. Unfortunately, all of J. B.s clients have retired, and he is unable to reel in star football player Popo Vanuatu. Desperate to find new clients, J. B. realizes India, with over one billion people, has real potential for untapped baseball talent. He approaches investor Mr. Chang with his proposal—a talent contest staged in India called ""Million Dollar Arm."" Contestants score points by demonstrating they can pitch a baseball with speed and accuracy. Along with the prize money, two winners will be flown to the U.S. and receive coaching to become legitimate baseball prospects within two years. Chang commits to providing the funding, on the condition the prospects are ready within only one year. With no alternative, J. B. reluctantly assures Chang the winners will be ready for a major-league try-out within one year.J. B. approaches veteran baseball pitching coach Tom House who explains that cricket, the main sport played in India, and baseball have very different motions for bowling and pitching, and getting a good recruit ready for a try-out in one year is extremely unlikely, if not impossible. J. B. points how House has nothing to lose and everything to gain by taking up the challenge, and House agrees.While Ash is holding down the fort in Los Angeles, J. B. flies to India. He is bewildered by the traffic, the overcrowding, and the lax way Indians conduct business. He is joined by the curmudgeonly Ray Poitevint, a longtime major league scout, and hires Amit Rohan as his interpreter. After lengthy try-outs in numerous cities, two youngsters emerge as the winners — Rinku Singh and Dinesh Patel, and they are flown to the U.S. to begin their baseball training. The pair, who grew up in poverty in India and do not speak or understand English, are instantly overwhelmed by the sights and sounds of America, although Rinku immediately develops a liking for pizza. Things soon come to a crunch when they are detained by hotel security for messing with elevator emergency controls, inadvertently getting themselves stuck and setting off the fire alarm. J. B. is subsequently forced to invite them to stay at his home. For their baseball training, J. B. dumps the pair by House and his staff while he runs off to close more deals. In being treated so, the pair feels like social outcasts. J. B.s tenant Brenda Fenwick is the only person who genuinely seems interested in their well-being.When J. B. takes the boys and Amit to a party thrown by Popo, whom J. B. hopes to sign, things get worse when Amit gets drunk after mistakenly drinking a punch with alcohol and Rinku becomes sick from overeating and as a result, both vomit on J. B.s windshield, forcing an enraged J. B. to drive them home, and forfeit the deal with Popo, who signed with someone else. Brenda calms him down and makes him realize he is treating the two boys like a business deal. The next day, J. B. trades in his Porsche for a Dodge Caravan and joins the boys for their prayers. Ignoring J. B.s pleas of the two boys lack of readiness, Chang insists his terms be fulfilled and the boys demonstrate their baseball skills one year from the time they arrived in the US. ESPN, Sports Illustrated, and local media are joined by numerous major-league scouts to watch the boys pitch. The try-out is a complete disaster, as the pair is both very nervous and pitch without speed or control, failing to impress anyone.Brenda convinces J. B. that the boys be given another try-out. Chang refused to go along with it, and no scouts are interested in wasting their time on another fiasco. All hope is lost until Ray arranges for J. B. to meet the Pittsburgh Pirates head scout who was away in Puerto Rico for the first try-out, and agrees to come. Chang changes his mind and sees the second try-out of Singh and Patel. This time, J. B. insists the boys relax and have fun. The scouts are quickly impressed as the pair consistently deliver 90+ mph fastballs thrown accurately, and both are offered a contract by the Pittsburgh Pirates. Unfortunately, on the boys way back to India for a final reunion with their families, they are killed in a plane crash. The movie ends with a slow and dark shot of J.B. receiving this news and passing out. This twist is completely unexpected and many argue that it takes away from the films overall vibe.

413,414,Miracles from Heaven,2016,/wiki/Miracles_from_Heaven_(film),"Set in Burleson, Texas, between 2008 and 2012, the film centers on a 10-year-old girl named Annabel Beam, daughter of Christy Beam. One day, Anna starts to vomit, and when examined by her doctor, he does not find anything abnormal. On March 20, 2008, Anna wakes up her family at midnight because of an intense stomach pain, severe enough that her parents decide to take her to the hospital.  Doctors find no signs of illness, except to say it could be either acid reflux, or lactose intolerance, but Christy is not convinced by this. The following morning, Christy finally finds a pediatrician in the hospital that is able to diagnose Anna with an abdominal obstruction, and he tells them he must operate immediately or she will die. After the emergency surgery is performed, the doctor explains that Anna has been left with pseudo-obstruction motility disorder and she is unable to eat, so feeding tubes are needed for her nutrition. The doctor then tells the Beams about Americas foremost pediatric gastroenterologist, Dr. Nurko, who practices in Boston, but explains it could take months for them to be seen. In January 2009, Christy and Anna travel to Boston despite not having an appointment with the doctor.Dr. Nurko has a last minute opening, and when Anna is subsequently examined at Boston Childrens Hospital, the extent of her chronic illness is found. She then goes through extensive treatment. During this ordeal, Anna and her mother befriend a local Massachusetts resident named Angela, as well as Ben and his sick daughter, Haley.On December 29, 2011, Anna, along with her bigger sister Abbie, climb up to a very high branch of an old cotton tree. While they are on that branch, it begins to break. Anna goes to the trunk for safety, whereupon stepping on it, she falls in a hole to the base of the tree. When Christy finds out what has happened, she desperately calls her husband, as well as the fire department. Anna is then rescued by the firefighters, who warn Christy to expect the worst by saying that nobody could fall 30 feet without sustaining a serious injury; broken bones or paralysis. Once out, Anna is airlifted to a hospital, where a battery of tests are run on her, and all of the tests come back negative. Other than a minor concussion, Anna is uninjured....Sometime after the fall, Anna seems to no longer be affected by her illness. When Christy and Anna go to an appointment with Dr. Nurko, he tells Christy that Anna is miraculously cured. Anna then recounts with her parents the experience she had during the fall. She describes how her soul left her body during the fall, and God promised that she would be cured of her illness upon her return to Earth.

414,415,Mission: Impossible III,2011,/wiki/Mission:_Impossible_III,"Ethan Hunt has retired from field work for the IMF. He instead trains new recruits while settling down with his fiancée, Julia Meade, a nurse who is unaware of Ethans true job. He is approached by fellow IMF agent John Musgrave about a mission to rescue one of Ethans protégés, Lindsey Farris. Lindsey was captured while investigating arms dealer Owen Davian. Musgrave has already prepared a team for Ethan: Declan Gormley, Zhen Lei, and his old partner Luther Stickell.The team rescues Lindsey and collects two damaged laptop computers. As they flee, Ethan discovers an explosive pellet implanted in Lindseys head. Before he can disable it, it goes off and kills her. Back in the U.S., Ethan and Musgrave are reprimanded by IMF Director Theodore Brassel. Ethan learns that Lindsey mailed him a postcard before her capture and discovers a magnetic microdot under the stamp.IMF technician Benji Dunn recovers enough data from the laptops to determine Davian will be in Vatican City to obtain a mysterious object called the ""Rabbits Foot"". Ethan plans a mission to capture Davian without seeking official approval. Before leaving, he and Julia have an impromptu wedding at the hospitals chapel. The team successfully infiltrates Vatican City and captures Davian.On the flight back to the U.S., Ethan threatens to drop Davian from the plane as he interrogates him about the Rabbits Foot, but Davian remains tightlipped. After landing, Ethan learns that the microdot contains a video of Lindsey warning that Brassel is working with Davian. The convoy taking Davian across the Chesapeake Bay Bridge–Tunnel is attacked, and Davian escapes. Ethan races to Julias workplace, only to find she has already been kidnapped. Davian gives Ethan 48 hours to recover the Rabbits Foot in exchange for Julias life, but Ethan is soon captured by the IMF.Musgrave takes part in Ethans interrogation but discreetly mouths that the Rabbits Foot is located in Shanghai, China, and provides Ethan with the means to escape. Ethan successfully escapes IMF headquarters shortly thereafter, resulting in him being declared an enemy of the state and placed on Interpol’s most wanted list. Ethan then travels to Shanghai where Declan Gormley, Zhen Lei, and Luther, sent by Musgrave under the guise of another operation, assist him in acquiring the Rabbits Foot. As he delivers the Rabbits Foot to the meeting point, Ethan is tranquilized. When he comes to, he realizes a micro-explosive is implanted in his head. The restrained Ethan sees Davian holding Julia at gunpoint. Julia is bound to a chair and gagged with duct tape on her mouth. Despite Ethan asserting that he brought the real Rabbits Foot, Davian shoots Julia and leaves.Musgrave arrives and explains that the woman killed was not Julia, but Davians head of security disguised as Julia, executed for failing to protect him in Vatican City. The ruse was to confirm the authenticity of the Rabbits Foot. Julia is alive and being held hostage. Musgrave reveals himself as the mole. He arranged for Davian to acquire the Rabbits Foot and sell it to a terrorist group so that IMF would have reasons to launch a preemptive strike. When Musgrave lets his guard down, Ethan knocks him unconscious. He frees himself and uses Musgraves phone to track the last calls location to find Julia. He arrives and finds the place, but encounters Davian. Davian triggers the micro-explosive in Ethans head, but Ethan duels him and kills him and then jury-rigs an impromptu defibrillator to deactivate the explosive. Before electrocuting himself, he kisses Julia and teaches her how to use his Beretta 92 to defend herself. While Ethan is dead, Musgrave and a henchman arrive, and Julia kills them. She successfully revives Ethan, and he explains his true IMF career to her.Back in the US, Ethan is congratulated by Brassel as he leaves for his honeymoon with Julia.",150000000,"[{""id"": 12, ""name"": ""Adventure""}, {""id"": 28, ""name"": ""Action""}, {""id"": 53, ""name"": ""Thriller""}]",http://www.missionimpossible.com/,956,"[{""id"": 220, ""name"": ""berlin""}, {""id"": 591, ""name"": ""cia""}, {""id"": 716, ""name"": ""vatican""}, {""id"": 833, ""name"": ""white house""}, {""id"": 1308, ""name"": ""secret identity""}, {""id"": 1328, ""name"": ""secret""}, {""id"": 1653, ""name"": ""explosive""}, {""id"": 1880, ""name"": ""mobile phone""}, {""id"": 1969, ""name"": ""map""}, {""id"": 2052, ""name"": ""traitor""}, {""id"": 2546, ""name"": ""mask""}, {""id"": 2676, ""name"": ""honeymoon""}, {""id"": 2682, ""name"": ""shanghai""}, {""id"": 3181, ""name"": ""pretended murder""}, {""id"": 3269, ""name"": ""secret mission""}, {""id"": 3344, ""name"": ""letter""}, {""id"": 3739, ""name"": ""funeral""}, {""id"": 3877, ""name"": ""covered investigation""}, {""id"": 4277, ""name"": ""to shoot dead""}, {""id"": 4289, ""name"": ""secret agent""}, {""id"": 4697, ""name"": ""video""}, {""id"": 4698, ""name"": ""stamp""}, {""id"": 4699, ""name"": ""hard drive""}, {""id"": 4700, ""name"": ""e-mail""}, {""id"": 4701, ""name"": ""decipherment""}, {""id"": 4702, ""name"": ""suitcase""}, {""id"": 6104, ""name"": ""computer""}, {""id"": 9748, ""name"": ""revenge""}, {""id"": 9826, ""name"": ""murder""}, {""id"": 10364, ""name"": ""mission""}, {""id"": 11612, ""name"": ""hospital""}, {""id"": 12965, ""name"": ""duel""}, {""id"": 18118, ""name"": ""disguise""}, {""id"": 33648, ""name"": ""celebration""}, {""id"": 46958, ""name"": ""good and bad""}, {""id"": 191881, ""name"": ""research laboratory""}, {""id"": 222423, ""name"": ""blast""}]",en,"Retired from active duty to train new IMF agents, Ethan Hunt is called back into action to confront sadistic arms dealer, Owen Davian.

415,416,Moneyball,2011,/wiki/Moneyball_(film),"Oakland Athletics general manager Billy Beane is upset by his teams loss to the New York Yankees in the 2001 American League Division Series. With the impending departure of star players Johnny Damon, Jason Giambi, and Jason Isringhausen to free agency, Beane needs to assemble a competitive team for 2002 with Oaklands limited budget.During a visit to the Cleveland Indians, Beane meets Peter Brand, a young Yale economics graduate with radical ideas about how to assess player value. Beane tests Brands theory by asking whether he would have drafted Beane out of high school; though scouts considered Beane hugely promising, his career in the major leagues was disappointing. Brand admits that, based on his method of assessing player value, he would not have drafted him until the ninth round. Impressed, Beane hires Brand as his assistant manager.Rather than relying on scouts experience and intuition, Brand uses sabermetrics, selecting players based on their on-base percentage (OBP). Brand and Beane hire undervalued players such as unorthodox submarine pitcher Chad Bradford, aging outfielder David Justice, and an injured catcher, Scott Hatteberg.Oakland scouts are hostile toward the strategy, and Beane fires one, Grady Fuson, after he accuses him of destroying the team. Beane also faces opposition from Art Howe (Philip Seymour Hoffman), the Athletics manager. With tensions already high between them due to a contract dispute, Howe disregards Beanes and Brands strategy and plays a lineup he prefers.Early in the season, the Athletics fare poorly, leading critics to dismiss the new method as a failure. Brand argues their sample size is too small to conclude the method does not work, and Beane convinces the owner to stay the course. He trades away the lone traditional first baseman, Carlos Peña, to force Howe to use Hatteberg, threatening to make similar deals if Howe does not cooperate. The Athletics win 19 consecutive games, tying the longest winning streak in American League history. Though Beane does not watch games, his young daughter persuades him to attend the next game, against the Kansas City Royals, when Oakland is leading 11–0 after the third inning. Beane arrives in the fourth inning, only to watch the team falter and allow the Royals to even the score. Thanks to a walk-off home run by Hatteberg, the Athletics win a record-breaking 20th consecutive win. Beane tells Brand he will not be satisfied until they have ""changed the game"" by winning the championship using their system.The Athletics eventually clinch the 2002 American League West title but lose to the Minnesota Twins in the 2002 American League Division Series. Beane is contacted by the owner of the Boston Red Sox, who realizes that sabermetrics is the future of baseball. Beane declines an offer to become the Red Sox general manager, despite the $12.5 million salary, which would have made him the highest-paid general manager in history. He returns to Oakland. Two years later, the Red Sox win the 2004 World Series using the model the Athletics pioneered.",50000000,"[{""id"": 18, ""name"": ""Drama""}]",http://www.moneyball-movie.com/,60308,"[{""id"": 240, ""name"": ""underdog""}, {""id"": 818, ""name"": ""based on novel""}, {""id"": 1480, ""name"": ""baseball""}, {""id"": 4298, ""name"": ""teamwork""}, {""id"": 6075, ""name"": ""sport""}, {""id"": 9104, ""name"": ""partner""}, {""id"": 41153, ""name"": ""meeting""}, {""id"": 41604, ""name"": ""oakland california""}, {""id"": 158470, ""name"": ""strategy""}, {""id"": 159431, ""name"": ""voice over""}, {""id"": 204841, ""name"": ""statistics""}]",en,"The story of Oakland Athletics general manager Billy Beane's successful attempt to put together a baseball team on a budget, by employing computer-generated analysis to draft his players.",46.180421,"[{""name"": ""Columbia Pictures"", ""id"": 5}, {""name"": ""Scott Rudin Productions"", ""id"": 258}]","[{""iso_3166_1"": ""US"", ""name"": ""United States of America""}]",9/22/2011,110206216,133,"[{""iso_639_1"": ""en"", ""name"": ""English""}]",Released,What are you really worth?,Moneyball,7,1381,0.5,0.139052421,0.08778733,0.179830045,-0.092042714,0.051265091,0.360947579,0.168085128,2.20412432

418,419,Moonrise Kingdom,2012,/wiki/Moonrise_Kingdom,"In September 1965, on the New England island of New Penzance, 12-year-old orphan Sam Shakusky is attending Camp Ivanhoe, a Khaki Scout summer camp led by Scout Master Randy Ward. Suzy Bishop, also 12, lives on the island with her parents Walt and Laura, both attorneys, and her three younger brothers in a house called Summers End. Sam and Suzy, both introverted, intelligent and mature for their age, met in the summer of 1964 during a church performance of Noyes Fludde and became pen pals. The relationship became romantic over the course of their correspondence and they made a secret pact to reunite and run away together. They hike, camp, and fish in the wilderness with the goal of reaching a secluded cove on the island. Meanwhile, the Khaki Scouts have become aware of Sams absence, finding a letter he left behind stating he has resigned his position as a Khaki Scout. Scout Master Ward tells the Khaki Scouts to use their skills to set up a search party and find Sam.Eventually, a group of Khaki Scouts confronts Sam and Suzy and try to capture them. During the resulting altercation, Suzy injures the Scouts de facto leader, Redford, and a stray arrow fired by one of the Scouts kills Camp Ivanhoes dog Snoopy. The Scouts flee, and Sam and Suzy hike to the cove, which they name Moonrise Kingdom. They set up camp, and as the romantic tension between them grows, they kiss repeatedly.Suzys parents, Scout Master Ward, the Scouts from Camp Ivanhoe, and Island Police Captain Duffy Sharp find Sam and Suzy in their tent at the cove. Suzys parents take her home and when Sharp contacts the foster parents they tell him they no longer wish to house Sam. He stays with Sharp while they await the arrival of ""Social Services""—an otherwise nameless woman who plans to place Sam in a ""juvenile refuge"" and  explore the possibility of treating him with electroshock therapy.The Camp Ivanhoe Scouts have a change of heart and decide to help the couple. Together, they paddle to a neighboring St. Jack Wood Island to seek out the help of Cousin Ben, an older relative of one of the Scouts. Ben works at Fort Lebanon, a larger Khaki Scout summer camp on St. Jack Wood Island run by Commander Pierce, who is Wards superior. Ben decides to try to take Sam and Suzy to a crabbing boat anchored off the island so that Sam can work as a crewman and avoid Social Services. Ben performs a ""wedding"" ceremony, which he admits is not legally binding before they leave. Sam and Suzy never make it onto the crabbing boat. Suzys parents, Captain Sharp, Social Services, and the scouts of Fort Lebanon under the command of Scout Master Ward pursue them instead.A violent hurricane and flash flood strike, and Sharp apprehends Sam and Suzy on the steeple of the church in which they first met. Lightning destroys the steeple, but Sharp saves them. During the storm, Sharp decides to become Sams legal guardian, allowing him to stay on New Penzance Island and maintain contact with Suzy.At Summers End, Sam is painting a landscape of Moonrise Kingdom.

419,420,Morning Glory,2010,/wiki/Morning_Glory_(2010_film),"Aspiring news producer Becky Fuller (Rachel McAdams) has dreamed since childhood of working for the Today show, but her dedication to her career is off-putting to potential suitors. After being laid off from her job at the local Good Morning New Jersey, her mother advises her to give up her dream before it becomes an embarrassment. However, Becky perseveres, sending many different résumés out. She finally receives a call from IBS, which is looking for a producer on its struggling national morning show, DayBreak.After a discouraging job interview with Jerry Barnes (Jeff Goldblum), who dismisses both her and DayBreak as also-rans, Becky bumps into one of her heroes, veteran television journalist Mike Pomeroy (Harrison Ford) in an elevator. She is brushed off rudely, but is told by the other passenger that this is just typical of Mike. Seemingly against his better judgement, Jerry hires Becky to be DayBreaks executive producer. On her first day, Becky realizes she has signed on to a show in turmoil, lacking in direction and money. After meeting the acerbic but long-suffering co-host Colleen Peck (Diane Keaton), who predicts Beckys demise, she fires the conceited co-host Paul McVee (Ty Burrell), much to the delight of her co-workers. Becky chooses an unwilling Mike as Colleens new co-host. Mike is under contract to IBS, but has mostly managed to escape being utilized while still getting paid. Becky finds a clause in his contract by which he is obliged to accept an official job offer or lose his salary, so he is forced to comply.Becky gets to know Adam Bennett (Patrick Wilson), another IBS producer who had worked with Mike previously. After initially teaming up to deal with Mike, they begin dating, and he is initially supportive of her dedication to her job. Mike proves to be hard going, throwing his weight about, trying to sabotage his debut on the show by getting drunk, refusing to banter with Colleen on air, and ensuring he only does serious news stories by making use of a clause in his contract that allows him to refuse certain assignments, like cooking segments, that he considers beneath him. Ratings continue to drop. Jerry shows Becky the figures in his office one afternoon. Becky tells Jerry that Mike is still getting up to speed, which Jerry dismisses. Jerry proceeds to inform Becky that IBS wants to cancel DayBreak and air game shows and syndicated talk instead. He further brings Becky down by blaming the perennial ratings slump and the shows impending demise on her. Becky asks Jerry not to tell anyone that DayBreak will end its 47-year run in six weeks due to poor staff morale.After a heated confrontation with Mike, Becky snaps and decides on a radical approach to save the show. She improves ratings by persuading Ernie (Matt Malloy), the DayBreak weatherman, to do the weather while doing stunts, such as riding a new Six Flags roller coaster. Colleen also expresses a keen interest in Beckys campaign to rejuvenate the show, and appears on a number of colorful segments that help the shows ratings. Jerry remains unconvinced that Becky can get the ratings up enough to stave off cancellation. Adam, not realizing what is on the line, teases Becky about how caught up she is in improving the ratings, but she sees it as a criticism that she has heard from previous men, and walks out. Mike tells her that he was once the same way, but ended up with no life outside of work.During a staff meeting, Mike shows interest in doing a story, surprising colleagues. Becky goes along, but realizes that he is going to the Governors summer house instead of the destination she expected. At this point, the six-week deadline is approaching that Friday. Fearing embarrassment and not being able to land employment in the future, Becky informs Mike that the show will be replaced with soap operas and game shows if ratings do not increase by the end of the week. Mike ends up confronting the Governor on charges of racketeering, and breaks the story of his arrest on live television. This increases DayBreaks ratings enough to secure another year for the show. Due to DayBreaks rise in popularity, Becky receives a job interview from  Today. During the interview, DayBreak is on. Between segments, Colleen tells Mike about the interview, and that his refusal to adapt has driven Becky away. He goes to the kitchen where food segments are done. Becky watches in shock as Mike tells the viewers how to make a good frittata. Becky runs back to the set and decides to remain at DayBreak.",40000000,"[{""id"": 35, ""name"": ""Comedy""}, {""id"": 18, ""name"": ""Drama""}, {""id"": 10749, ""name"": ""Romance""}]",http://www.morningglorymovie.com/,38357,"[{""id"": 13281, ""name"": ""work ethic""}, {""id"": 13384, ""name"": ""tv morning show""}, {""id"": 13424, ""name"": ""tv reporter""}]",en,"A young and devoted morning television producer is hired as an executive producer on a  long-running morning show at a once-prominent but currently failing station in New York City.

420,421,Mortdecai,2015,/wiki/Mortdecai_(film),"Lord Charlie Mortdecai, an unscrupulous art dealer and swindler, is accosted in Hong Kong by one of his victims, a gangster named Fang. Jock, Mortdecais faithful manservant, extricates his master before they can be killed by Fangs gunmen. They return to London, where Mortdecai and his wife, Johanna, consider ways to pay off their crushing debt to the UK taxman. A painting by Francisco Goya becomes the target of an elaborate theft which results in the murders of an art restorer and one of the thieves. Inspector Alistair Martland is put on the case. Martland, who has been in love with Johanna since college, asks Mortdecai to assist him. Martland believes the prime suspect to be Emil Strago. Mortdecai agrees to help in exchange for 10% of the insurance money.Mortdecai interviews people affiliated with the art world, including Spinoza, an art smuggler. While they argue, Strago arrives and shoots at them, killing Spinoza; Mortdecai and Jock escape unharmed. Johanna meets with a man known as The Duke, who knows the thief and says that the painting conceals the location of a hoard of Nazi gold. Mortdecai is kidnapped by thugs working for a Russian named Romanov. Romanov and Strago think that Mortdecai has the painting. Romanov threatens torture unless Mortdecai surrenders it, but Mortdecai escapes through a window and Jock spirits him away.Martland, wanting to be alone with Johanna, sends Mortdecai to America to meet with Milton Krampf, a potential buyer for the Goya. Mortdecai plans to sell his  beloved Rolls-Royce to the American, and uses the opportunity to see if Krampf is involved with the theft. Arriving in Los Angeles, he discovers that the Goya has been hidden in the Rolls. Spinoza, in the employ of Krampf, stashed it there after stealing it from Strago, the original thief; Krampf planned to dupe Mortdecai into smuggling the Goya into the United States in his own car. He invites Mortdecai to a party that night, where Krampf intends to display the ill-gotten painting. Jock suggests that he and Mortdecai steal the painting for themselves during the party. Krampfs daughter, Georgina, is secretly Stragos partner. She attempts to seduce Mortdecai while Strago steals the painting. Johanna arrives with Martland and catches her husband in a compromising position. Mortdecai flees the scene to help Jock steal the painting, but they find Krampf has been murdered by Strago and the painting is gone. Martland and Johanna capture Strago, but Georgina gets the drop on them, liberating her lover and the painting.

Johanna reveals that the painting was a fake; The Duke has the real one hidden.The Mortdecais retrieve the painting and put it up for auction. The sale attracts Fang, still seeking revenge, and Romanov, who wants the painting regardless of cost.  While Mortdecai and Jock waylay both mens thugs, Strago attempts to kidnap Johanna. Mortdecai bids up the Goya but Romanov wins it; Martland apprehends Strago during the commotion. The Mortdecais find that the proceeds of the sale pay off their debt courtesy of Martland and that after the sale they are still broke however, the painting is revealed to be another fake.

421,422,Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising,2016,/wiki/Neighbors_2:_Sorority_Rising,"Two years after the events of the first film, Mac (Seth Rogen) and Kelly (Rose Byrne) are trying to sell their home with the arrival of another baby. A couple, Eric (Sam Richardson) and Jessica Baiers (Abbi Jacobson) are looking to buy; the realtor (Liz Cackowski) tells Mac and Kelly that their house is in escrow for 30 days, so the buyers will check in every now and then to make sure everything is okay. Meanwhile, Macs friend, Jimmy (Ike Barinholtz), and his once-again wife Paula (Carla Gallo) are also expecting a baby. At the Phi Lambda sorority, Shelby (Chloë Grace Moretz), a freshman, learns that sororities are not allowed to host parties, and can only attend frat parties. Shelby goes to a frat party and meets two other freshmen, Beth (Kiersey Clemons) and Nora (Beanie Feldstein). They are disgusted by the sexist and perverse nature of the party and leave. Bonding over their dissatisfaction, the trio decides to set up a new sorority, Kappa Nu, to host their own parties.Meanwhile, Teddy Sanders (Zac Efron) is at a dinner with his old frat brothers Pete (Dave Franco), Scoonie (Christopher Mintz-Plasse), and Garf (Jerrod Carmichael). Since graduating, they had been successful in their own jobs: Pete is working as an architect and has come out of the closet, Scoonie has launched his own app, and Garf is now a cop. Due to the events from the first film, Teddy now has a criminal record and cannot get a worthwhile job to support himself (having been fired from his job as a shirt model). Since that time, he had continued blaming the Radners for both the record and the loss of career opportunities. Petes boyfriend Darren (John Early) then proposes to him, and Pete accepts, leading Pete to ask Teddy to move out, which later escalates into an argument between the two. The following day, the girls try to rent the adjacent house to the Radners, but do not have enough money to pay for it. Teddy, finding an opportunity where he can be valued, offers to help them and suggests a successful way to afford the rent. That night, they throw their first party. Horrified to learn they are a sorority, Mac and Kelly ask Shelby to keep the noise down. Mac and Kelly report them to Dean Gladstone (Lisa Kudrow), but she is unable to intervene since they are an independent sorority and she fears that shutting it down may lead to a public relations nightmare regarding sexism.The couple contact Shelbys father (Kelsey Grammer), but he fails to control the situation. Feeling outraged, the girls constantly haze the Radners. Mac, Kelly, Jimmy, and Paula retaliate by causing a bed bug infestation in the house, resulting in a fumigation just in time for the Baiers visit. The girls plan to raise money by selling weed at the schools tailgate and eliminating all the other competition by getting all the other weed dealers on campus arrested. Teddy strongly objects and the girls vote to kick him out of the house. Spurned, Teddy decides to join forces with the Radners to take down the sorority. They all go to the tailgate event to steal the weed. Teddy distracts the girls while Mac steals their weed supply. Shelby catches Mac, but he manages to escape. As gratitude for Teddys help, Mac and Kelly allow him to stay at their place until he decides what he wants to do with his life, where he grows closer to them.In retaliation for the tailgate, the girls switch Macs and Kellys phone numbers with their own, leading Kelly to become paranoid, and Mac to end up in Sydney, Australia. When he returns, Mac and Kelly find that they have been robbed and the sorority is selling their stuff and has spray-painted ""Kappa Nu Steals From You"" in the house. This causes the Baiers to threaten to pull out from the deal, while Mac and Kelly also reflect if they have been good parents. When the realtor of the sorority house reveals the girls are late on their payments, the Baiers give Mac and Kelly a day to get them out of the house. The girls find an eviction notice on their door. With barely any money to support themselves, Shelby says the only way they can win is to abandon their morals and resort to having a basic frat party with more sex appeal. They advertise the party to everyone on campus, leading to more people showing up at the house.Jimmy and Paula sneak into the party while Teddy tries to shut off the power. Teddy gets into the electrical box, but the girls have a backup power source. While Jimmy ends up getting roofied, Shelby enters the Radners house to cut off their phones. Mac and Teddy chase her to the garage, but get locked inside. They break out by using airbags from an old car.Disgusted by how much they have degraded themselves, Beth and Nora decide to quit the sorority and blame Shelby for the disaster, leading the other girls to leave as well. Mac and Kelly feel sorry for the girls after hearing that Shelby only formed the sorority so she could make friends since back in high school she had none and was constantly bullied and rejected. They also realize that they too are setting a terrible example for their daughter with their behavior in ruining Kappa Nu by trying to evict the girls so they could allow the Baiers to move in to their old home. Relating to her own experience in being rejected through high school, Kelly helps the girls mend their friendship and to go back to what they believe in. The girls then kick the frat boys out and have a more empowering party. The success of being the first sorority to throw a party brings girls from Phi Lambda and other sororities who want to pledge for Kappa Nu. By the end of the night, the girls make enough money not only to keep their house, but to give the surplus to Mac and Kelly so they can rent out their house due to overflowing pledges. Mac and Kelly happily agree, as long as they get five money-buckets per month. Paula goes into labor, meanwhile Teddy apologizes to Pete and Darren for his behavior and gets reassurance that he will never lose his best friend. Mac and Kellys anxiety about their parenthood is also alleviated as they realize they have been good parents all along.Three months later, Teddy is helping Pete get ready to walk down the aisle. Teddy has become a wedding planner for gay couples and enabling him a worthwhile career. Mac and Kelly have now moved into their new home.

423,424,Never Let Me Go,2010,/wiki/Never_Let_Me_Go_(2010_film),"The film begins with on-screen captions explaining that a medical breakthrough in 1952 has permitted the human lifespan to be extended beyond 100 years. It is narrated by 28-year-old Kathy H as she reminisces about her childhood at a boarding school called Hailsham, as well as her adult life after leaving the school. The first act of the film depicts the young Kathy, along with her friends Tommy and Ruth, spending their childhood at Hailsham in 1978. The students are encouraged to create artwork, and their best work gets into The Gallery run by a mysterious woman known only as Madame. One day, a new teacher, Miss Lucy, quietly informs the students of their fate: they are destined to be organ donors and will die, or ""complete"", in their early adulthood. Shortly afterward she is fired by the headmistress, Miss Emily, for sharing this revelation with the children. As time passes, Kathy falls in love with Tommy, but Ruth and Tommy begin a relationship and stay together throughout the rest of their time at Hailsham.In the second act, Kathy, Ruth, and Tommy, now teenagers, are rehoused in cottages on a farm in 1985. They are permitted to leave the grounds on day trips, but are resigned to their eventual fate. At the farm, they meet former pupils of schools similar to theirs, and it is revealed that they are all clones. They also hear rumours of the possibility of ""deferral"" – a temporary reprieve from organ donation for donors who are in love and can prove it. Tommy becomes convinced that The Gallery at Hailsham was intended to look into their souls and that artwork sent to The Gallery will be able to confirm true love where it is present. The relationship between Tommy and Ruth becomes sexual, and jealousy causes Kathy and Ruth to break their friendship. The lonely Kathy leaves and becomes a ""carer"" – a clone who is given a temporary reprieve from donation as a reward for supporting and comforting donors as they are made to give up their organs. Tommy and Ruths relationship ends.In the third and final act, in 1994, Kathy is still working as a carer, and has watched many clones gradually die as their organs are harvested. Kathy, who has not seen Ruth or Tommy since the farm, discovers Ruth, frail after two donations. They find Tommy, who is also weakened by his donations, and drive to the sea. There, Ruth admits that she did not love Tommy, and only seduced him because she was afraid to be alone. She is consumed with guilt and has been searching for a way to help Tommy and Kathy. She believes that the rumours of ""deferral"" are true, and has found the address of the gallery owner, Madame, who she thinks may grant deferrals to couples in love. Ruth dies on the operating table shortly afterward.Kathy and Tommy finally begin a relationship. Tommy explains to Kathy that he has been creating art in the hope that it will aid deferral. He and Kathy drive to visit Madame, who lives with the headmistress of Hailsham. The two teachers tell them that there is no such thing as deferral, and that Tommys artworks will not help him. They explain that the purpose of The Gallery was not to look into their souls but to investigate whether the ""all but human"" clones even have souls at all; Hailsham was the last place to consider the ethical implications of the donor scheme. As they take in the news on their return journey, Tommy breaks down in an explosion of rage and frustration, and he and Kathy cling to each other in grief.

424,425,Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian,2014,/wiki/Night_at_the_Museum:_Battle_of_the_Smithsonian,"Two years after the events of the first film, Larry Daley, former night guard at the American Museum of Natural History, now runs his own direct response television company that sells inventions based on his experiences. He travels to the museum, discovering most of the exhibits will be moved to the Federal Archives at the Smithsonian Institution and replaced with holographic information providers. The Tablet of Ahkmenrah is to remain in the museum, leaving most of the exhibits without the ability to come to life at night. After the exhibits are moved, Larry receives a phone call from  Jedediah, who informs him that Dexter the monkey stole the tablet and took it to the Smithsonian, bringing every exhibit in it to life. Larry travels to Washington, DC, navigating his way to the archives with help from his son Nick while posing as a night guard.Larry finds his friends trapped in their shipping container under attack from Ahkmenrah’s evil older brother Kahmunrah, accidentally activating the tablet and bringing the exhibits in the Smithsonian to life again. Kahmunrah reveals his plans to use the tablet’s powers to conquer the world. Larry escapes, aided by a gigantic octopus and General George A. Custer, who is captured, and then the adventurous Amelia Earhart, who becomes his travelling companion around the museum. The two evade Kahmunrah’s army, trapping them in the portrait of V-J Day in Times Square. Kahmunrah enlists fellow evil historical leaders, Ivan the Terrible, Napoleon Bonaparte, and Al Capone to help capture Larry and retrieve the tablet. Jedediah tries to help but is placed in an hourglass. Kahmunrah is unable to open the Gate of the Underworld with the tablet, and gives Larry and Amelia an hour to translate it, or Kahmunrah will kill Larry and his friends.While searching for someone in the museum who can help, Larry and Amelia end up falling in love. They travel to the National Air and Space Museum, briefly encountering the statue of Abraham Lincoln at the Lincoln Memorial. Inside the museum, Larry grounds all of the aircraft and rockets from taking off, before a group of Albert Einstein bobbleheads inform him that the combination is the value of pi. Napoleon, Ivan, and Capone’s troops arrive, prompting Larry and Amelia to escape using the Wright Flyer. They crash the plane into the Smithsonian, where Kahmunrah uses the acquired combination to summon an army of bird-headed warriors. Lincoln crashes in through the window, frightening the warriors back into the Underworld.Amelia gathers an army of allies including Larry’s friends and Custer, leading to a climactic battle. But Custer is afraid to fight after remembering Little Big Horn. Larry persuades him to forget the past and fight on. Meanwhile, Octavius rescues Jedediah, who together, turn the tide of the Battle. Larry obtains the tablet, and devises a plan to stop Kahmunrah. Inspired by an idea given to him by Lincoln, Larry sparks a disagreement between Capone, Bonaparte and Ivan, causing them to brawl amongst themselves. Larry attempts to escape, only to be cut off by an angry Kahmunrah, brandishing a Khopesh. After a brief scuffle between Larry, armed with his flashlight, and Kahmunrah, Amelia eventually manages to use the tablet to open the gate, and Larry finally defeats Kahmunrah, banishing him to the Underworld. Amelia flies Larry and the New York exhibits back home, giving Larry a final kiss before taking off in her plane, knowing she will become dust before reaching the Smithsonian. Two months later, Larry sells his company, donating the money to the museum to renovate it, and the exhibits remain, capable of moving about at night under the pretense of being animatronics. Larry is rehired as a night guard and aids a woman who resembles Amelia during the debut of the museums new extension of visiting hours.",150000000,"[{""id"": 12, ""name"": ""Adventure""}, {""id"": 14, ""name"": ""Fantasy""}, {""id"": 28, ""name"": ""Action""}, {""id"": 35, ""name"": ""Comedy""}, {""id"": 10751, ""name"": ""Family""}]",http://www.nightatthemuseummovie.com,18360,"[{""id"": 2598, ""name"": ""museum""}, {""id"": 5648, ""name"": ""theodore roosevelt""}, {""id"": 179431, ""name"": ""duringcreditsstinger""}, {""id"": 194476, ""name"": ""amelia earhart""}, {""id"": 209642, ""name"": ""smithsonian""}]",en,"Hapless museum night watchman Larry Daley must help his living, breathing exhibit friends out of a pickle now that they've been transferred to the archives at the Smithsonian Institution.

425,426,Nightcrawler,2014,/wiki/Nightcrawler_(film),"Petty thief Louis ""Lou"" Bloom is caught stealing from a Los Angeles construction site by a security guard. He attacks the guard, steals his watch and leaves with the stolen material. After selling the material at a scrap yard, Lou asks for a job, but the foreman says he does not hire thieves. While driving home, Lou sees a car crash and pulls over. Stringers—freelance photojournalists—arrive and record two police officers pulling a woman from the wreck. One of the stringers, Joe Loder, tells Lou that they sell their footage to local news stations. Inspired, Lou steals a bicycle and pawns it for a camcorder and a police radio scanner. After two unsuccessful attempts at recording incidents, Lou records the aftermath of a fatal carjacking and sells the footage to KWLA 6. The morning news director Nina Romina tells him the station is especially interested in footage of violent incidents in affluent areas. Lou hires an assistant, Rick, a young man desperate for money. To give his footage more impact, Lou begins tampering with crime scenes and in one case moves a body. As Lous work gains traction, he buys better equipment and a faster car.Lou coerces Nina into a date and threatens to terminate his business with her unless she has sex with him. A sexual relationship is implied. The next day he turns down a business offer from Loder, who beats him to an important plane crash story later that night. Nina berates Lou to get better footage and keep his end of their bargain. In retaliation, Lou sabotages Joes van; when it crashes, Joe is severely injured and Lou records the aftermath. Later, Lou and Rick arrive before the police at the site of a home invasion in an affluent neighborhood. Lou records footage of the gunmen leaving in their SUV and of the victims in the house. The news staff fret over the ethics of the footage but Nina is eager to break the story. In exchange, Lou demands public credit and more money. Police detective Frontieri questions Lou about his connection to the home invasion. He gives her edited footage of the home invasion, cutting out the parts with the gunmen. That night, he and Rick track down the gunmen; Lou plans to follow them to a more crowded public area, then call the police and record the ensuing confrontation. Alarmed, Rick demands half the money Lou stands to make, threatening to tell the police about Lous crimes; Lou agrees.When the gunmen stop at a restaurant, Lou phones the police. They arrive and exchange gunfire. One suspect is killed while the other manages to escape in his SUV. The police give chase with Lou and Rick tailing and recording. After the gunmans SUV crashes, Lou urges Rick to film the gunman, claiming he is dead. The wounded gunman shoots Rick through the glass and tries to escape but is shot by police. As Rick lies dying, Lou films him and tells him that he cannot work with someone who has leverage over him. Nina is awed by the chase footage and expresses her devotion to Lou. The news team discovers that the home invasion was actually a drug deal gone wrong; Nina refuses to report this information to maximize the storys impact. Police try to confiscate the footage for evidence but Nina defends her right to withhold it. Interrogated by Frontieri, Lou fabricates a story about the men in the SUV following him; Frontieri suspects he is lying, but cannot prove it. Lou hires a team of interns and buys new vans to expand his business.",8500000,"[{""id"": 80, ""name"": ""Crime""}, {""id"": 18, ""name"": ""Drama""}, {""id"": 53, ""name"": ""Thriller""}]",http://nightcrawlerfilm.com/,242582,"[{""id"": 917, ""name"": ""journalism""}, {""id"": 1353, ""name"": ""underground""}, {""id"": 3586, ""name"": ""tv station""}, {""id"": 9740, ""name"": ""sociopath""}, {""id"": 14903, ""name"": ""home invasion""}, {""id"": 15483, ""name"": ""car chase""}, {""id"": 158584, ""name"": ""tv news""}, {""id"": 167925, ""name"": ""employer employee relationship""}, {""id"": 211062, ""name"": ""ethics""}, {""id"": 215774, ""name"": ""stringer""}]",en,"When Lou Bloom, desperate for work, muscles into the world of L.A. crime journalism, he blurs the line between observer and participant to become the star of his own story.

426,427,No Good Deed,2014,/wiki/No_Good_Deed_(2014_film),"Colin Evans (Idris Elba) has been imprisoned for over five years for manslaughter in the state of Tennessee. He is eligible for parole and during his parole hearing Colin pleads his case to the board members. He claims he is a changed man and has been rehabilitated. The parole board denies his release, claiming that he is not trustworthy enough. On the way back to prison, a frustrated Colin outwits the corrections officers transporting him by killing them both and escapes with the van.In Atlanta, Terri Granger (Taraji P. Henson) is home with her young children. Her best friend Meg (Leslie Bibb) suggests that Terri relax and not stress herself with her children and husband Jeffrey (Henry Simmons). Meg knows that Terris relationship with Jeffrey has been taxing. Hence, Meg tells her not to worry and that she will visit her at night for a girls night to cheer Terri up. Jeffrey arrives home just long enough to pack his things and visit his father, abruptly leaving Terri with their two children.Colin stalks his ex-fiancée Alexis (Kate del Castillo) and witnesses her meeting another man at an outdoor cafe. She greets the man with a hug and joins him at a table. Colin follows her home where they argue violently, resulting in him murdering her in fury. Later, Colin is driving on a dark road in a terrible storm and loses control of his car, crashing it into a tree. Walking down the road, he notices one house with the lights on, and it is Terris. He rings her doorbell and asks her if he can use her phone to call for a tow truck. She is at first apprehensive, but she gives him the phone. They engage in chit chat, and, feeling more comfortable with the stranger, she invites him inside. Terri reveals that before she married and had children, she was a criminal prosecutor for the District Attorneys office. Colin tells Terri that he just broke up with his fiancée because she was cheating on him.Meg arrives at the house and is shocked to see Colin. When she inquires about where he lives, he is evasive. Later, the three talk and share glasses of wine. When Terri leaves momentarily to comfort her baby, Meg and Colin are left alone. Colin excuses himself for a cigarette break. Meg follows him into the garage, smokes with him and resumes her inquiries about him. Colin suggests that he is having an affair with Terri, but Meg doubts Terri would not have previously confided this. Meg bluntly tells him that his story ""doesnt add up"" and declares that she will find out the truth. She begins to call out to Terri, but Colin quickly grabs a shovel and bashes Meg in the head with it, killing her.Terri returns to the hall after putting her baby to bed and is surprised to see that Meg is not there. Colin tells Terri that Meg left, but Terri is suspicious, especially when she sees Megs umbrella in the stand. Terri realizes that Colin is not the nice person that he appeared to be. Alarmed, she rushes to the kitchen to call the police, only to find out that Colin has disconnected all the wires and hidden all of her knives. She realizes that she and her children are in danger, and she rushes to her daughter Ryans bedroom, finding Colin playing with the child. As they walk out of Ryans bedroom, Terri hits him with a fire extinguisher and sprays him in the face with it. He falls down the stairs, and she runs to get her children, but as she leaves Ryans room, she sees that Colin has recovered. He tells her to put the children back in their rooms and reveals his gun. Terri obeys him (including taking her clothes off in his presence). In a brief moment where she strikes him unconscious, she manages to flee to her home office where there is a fax machine. She dials 911 for help. Colin recovers and discovers her in the office. He yanks the phone out of her hand just as she finishes her call. She begs him to leave, explaining him that the police are coming, that his blood is all over her kitchen (because she managed to cut him). Colin forces her to take the children into her vehicle and drive away with him. While walking out of the garage, Terri sees Megs dead body on the floor.Tearfully, Terri asks him why he is doing this; Colin replies that she will see for herself soon. He refuses to tell her their destination. As they pass a police car on the road, Terri flashes her headlights when she thinks Colin is not looking, hoping to catch their attention. The police car forces them to pull over, and a young policeman questions them. He requests that Terri step out of the vehicle, which she does. He asks her if she is all right, to which she is forced to reluctantly agree because Colin is alone with her children in her vehicle. The policeman senses her reluctance, but before he can do anything, Colin steps out of the car and shoots him dead. He shoves Terri back into the vehicle, and they resume their journey.Colin makes Terri drive to Alexis house. She panics when she sees Alexis dead body in the bedroom. As she tries to find the first aid kit in the house, the high winds from the storm cause Terris car alarm to activate. Worried that the noise will attract attention, Colin binds her hands behind her back and her feet with medical gauze while he goes to check on the car. As Colin exits the house, Alexis phone rings. Terri manages to answer the phone and is surprised to hear the voice of her husband Jeffrey, who is calling Alexis to find out why she has not arrived at the hotel for a rendezvous with him. Terri realizes that he was not out of town with his father after all and has been having an affair with Alexis. Terri also realizes that the encounter with Colin was not so random and that Colin wants revenge on Jeffrey because of his affair with Alexis. Terri tells her surprised husband the truth and has him call 911. She misleads Colin into thinking that she and her children have escaped. When Colin discovers her, she attacks him, grabbing his gun and shooting him until he falls out of a window, dead.The police arrive with Jeffrey. He tells Terri that he is sorry and that Alexis meant nothing to him. Terri punches Jeffery in the face and walks away.

It turns out that he texted Emma and then came to the apartment she shares with some other residents—Patrice (Greta Gerwig), Shira (Mindy Kaling), and Guy (Guy Branum). Once there, he took off all his clothes and then passed out. Emma leads Adam to her bedroom to retrieve his missing pants and they end up having sex.The two have sex again at Adam’s house and before she leaves Adam agrees to her proposal for a casual relationship (as she puts it, using each other for the dirty and nothing else).

At first things go well, but Adam becomes jealous when Sam (Ben Lawson)—another resident—seeks her attention. Adam brings Emma a gift (a mix CD) and she rebuffs him, saying they should stop for a while and hook up with other people.

A nervous Emma phones Adam and tells him that she misses him. He responds that they were never really together.

428,429,Noah,2014,/wiki/Noah_(2014_film),"As a young boy, Noah witnesses his father, Lamech, killed by a young Tubal-cain. Years later, an adult Noah lives with his wife Naameh and their sons Shem, Ham, and Japheth. After seeing a flower grow instantly from the ground and being haunted by dreams of a great flood, Noah takes them to visit his grandfather Methuselah.They encounter a group of people recently killed and take in and adopt the lone survivor, a girl named Ila. Ila is treated for an abdominal wound and will survive, but Naameh determines that she will be unable to have children. Noah and his family are chased by the murderers and seek refuge with the fallen angels known as the ""Watchers"", in whose territory Methuselah lives. The Watchers are confined on Earth as stone golems for helping humans banished from the Garden of Eden. Methuselah gives Noah a seed from Eden and tells Noah that he was chosen for a reason. Returning to his tent that night, Noah plants the seed in the ground. The Watchers arrive the next morning and debate whether they should help Noah until they see water spout from the spot where Noah planted the seed. After a forest grows instantly, the Watchers agree to help Noah and his family build an ark.After birds fly to the ark, Tubal-cain arrives with his followers and confronts Noah. Noah defies Tubal-cain and remarks that there is no escape for the line of Cain. Tubal-cain retreats and decides to build weapons to defeat the Watchers and take the ark. As the ark nears completion, animals of various species enter the ark and are sedated with incense.With Ila having become enamored of Shem, Noah goes to a nearby settlement to find wives for Ham and Japheth but, seeing the settlers selling their daughters for food, he abandons his effort and begins believing that the Creator wants all of humanity dead. He tells his family that he will not seek wives for his younger sons. After the flood, they will be the last humans and there will be no new human generations.Devastated that he will be alone his entire life, Ham runs into the forest. Naameh begs Noah to reconsider but, when he will not, she goes to Methuselah for help. Ila encounters Methuselah who cures her infertility. Ham, searching for a wife on his own, befriends the refugee Nael.After it starts raining, Tubal-cain becomes angry that he was not chosen to be saved and incites his followers to make a run for the ark. Noah finds Ham in the forest and forces Ham to save himself, but leaves Nael to die when she is caught in an animal trap. Noahs family enter the ark except for Methuselah, who remains in the forest and is swept away by the rushing waters. The Watchers fight off Tubal-cain and his mob of followers, sacrificing themselves and ascending to heaven, their reward for protecting Noah. As the flood drowns the remaining humans, an injured Tubal-cain climbs onto the ark and solicits Ham, playing on anger toward Noah for allowing Nael to die.Ila discovers she is pregnant as the rains stop and begs the Creator to let the child live. Noah interprets the ending of the rain to mean he must ensure the extinction of humans and, against his wifes protests, resolves that, if the child is a girl, he will kill her. Months pass, and Ila and Shem build a raft to escape Noahs resolve, but Noah discovers and burns it. Ila then starts feeling labor pains and gives birth to twin girls. After Ham calls Noah telling him the beasts are awake and eating each other, Tubal-cain emerges and attempts to hit Noah. Noah and Tubal-cain engage in combat. Shem promises Ila that Noah will not harm their daughters and goes to stop him. He attacks Noah as Tubal-cain falls to the ground only to be knocked out.

429,430,Now You See Me 2,2016,/wiki/Now_You_See_Me_2,"Eighteen months after outwitting the FBI, the remaining members of the Four Horsemen—J. Daniel Atlas (Jesse Eisenberg), Merritt McKinney (Woody Harrelson) and Jack Wilder (Dave Franco)—are in hiding in New York City, awaiting further instructions from The Eye, the secret society of magicians theyve been recruited into. Atlas, having grown tired of waiting for a mission, seeks out The Eye himself. His search leads him to an underground tunnel in which he hears a voice that tells him that his wait may be coming to an end. The Horsemens handler, FBI Special Agent Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo), ultimately assigns them a new mission, exposing corrupt businessman Owen Case (Ben Lamb), whose new software secretly steals data on its users for Cases benefit. Lula May (Lizzy Caplan) is added to the team to replace former member Henley Reeves (Isla Fisher), who has left the Horsemen after breaking up with Atlas.The Horsemen hijack the launch party for the new software, but the show is interrupted by a mysterious individual who reveals to the world that Wilder, believed to be dead, is actually alive, and that Rhodes is their mole, forcing him to escape. While escaping, the Horsemen enter their escape tube on a roof and emerge in Macau, where they are captured by mercenaries and Chase McKinney (also played by Woody Harrelson), Merritts twin brother. The Horsemen are then brought before Chases employer, technology prodigy Walter Mabry (Daniel Radcliffe), Cases former business partner, who faked his own death after Case stole Walters company. Mabry conscripts the Horsemen into stealing the data-mining device developed by Case to prevent him from using it. The chip allows the user to decrypt and access any electronic device around the world. The Horsemen agree to steal the device.They get supplies at a famous magic shop in Macau, run by Li (Jay Chou) and Bu Bu (Tsai Chin), and secretly contact The Eye to arrange to hand over the device after they steal it. Meanwhile, Rhodes is branded a fugitive and forced to spring his rival Thaddeus Bradley (Morgan Freeman), whom Rhodes blames for the death of his father, out of jail for help.The Horsemen infiltrate the facility and steal the chip, despite being interrogated and searched by security guard Allen Scott-Frank (Henry Lloyd-Hughes). Atlas is then confronted by Mabry, revealing that Atlas had been fooled into thinking that Mabry was The Eye. Rhodes intervenes and pretends to retrieve the device, but is captured by Mabrys henchmen and taken to a nearby yacht. There, he learns Mabry is acting on behalf of his father, Arthur Tressler             (Michael Caine), whom Rhodes exposed with the help of the Horsemen in the first film. Tressler places Rhodes in a replica of the same safe that his father died in and leaves him to drown, but Rhodes escapes and is rescued by the Horsemen. They find that the chip they had stolen appears to be a fake.Rhodes and the Horsemen broadcast that they will be performing live in London at midnight on New Years Eve. Mabry and Tressler, thinking that they have the computer chip, make haste to London, where the Horsemen are performing a series of tricks on the streets. At the Shard, Mabry, Tressler and Chase discover that Rhodes is still alive and capture the five, taking them on his private plane. Mabry takes the card from them, and Rhodes and the other Horsemen are thrown out of the plane supposedly in flight. However, Tressler finds that the plane has never taken off, and instead is on a barge in the middle of the River Thames, with their criminal activities being broadcast live to the world by the Horsemen in the process. Mabry, Tressler and Chase are arrested and Rhodes, now going by his real surname, ""Shrike"", entrusts the information theyve gathered on the real criminals activities to the FBI, who allows him a head start to escape.Rhodes and the Horsemen are then taken to meet the leaders of the Eye in a secret library in Greenwich Observatory. They find that the members of the Eye include Li, Bu Bu, Allen Scott-Frank and Thaddeus Bradley. Bradley reveals that he was actually Lionel Shrikes partner, and he had been masquerading as his rival as part of their planned act: he had exposed Lionels first act planning to be dumbfounded by his second act, only to abandon the Eye after Lionels death. Before Bradley leaves, he asks Rhodes to be his successor in the Eyes leadership and requests that the Horsemen enter a curtain. The Horsemen, along with Rhodes, go behind the curtain, and find a door behind it. They enter the room and find a staircase; the camera zooms out to the stairs, forming an Eye.",90000000,"[{""id"": 28, ""name"": ""Action""}, {""id"": 12, ""name"": ""Adventure""}, {""id"": 35, ""name"": ""Comedy""}, {""id"": 80, ""name"": ""Crime""}, {""id"": 9648, ""name"": ""Mystery""}, {""id"": 53, ""name"": ""Thriller""}]",http://nowyouseeme.movie,291805,"[{""id"": 212, ""name"": ""london england""}, {""id"": 478, ""name"": ""china""}, {""id"": 2343, ""name"": ""magic""}, {""id"": 2908, ""name"": ""secret society""}, {""id"": 7002, ""name"": ""vigilante""}, {""id"": 9663, ""name"": ""sequel""}, {""id"": 9748, ""name"": ""revenge""}, {""id"": 10051, ""name"": ""heist""}, {""id"": 10562, ""name"": ""on the run""}, {""id"": 228519, ""name"": ""macau china""}, {""id"": 236458, ""name"": ""magician""}]",en,"One year after outwitting the FBI and winning the public’s adulation with their mind-bending spectacles, the Four Horsemen resurface only to find themselves face to face with a new enemy who enlists them to pull off their most dangerous heist yet.",51.535701,"[{""name"": ""Summit Entertainment"", ""id"": 491}, {""name"": ""Lionsgate"", ""id"": 1632}, {""name"": ""K/O Paper Products"", ""id"": 7296}, {""name"": ""TIK Films"", ""id"": 72441}]","[{""iso_3166_1"": ""CA"", ""name"": ""Canada""}, {""iso_3166_1"": ""CN"", ""name"": ""China""}, {""iso_3166_1"": ""GB"", ""name"": ""United Kingdom""}, {""iso_3166_1"": ""US"", ""name"": ""United States of America""}]",6/2/2016,334901337,129,"[{""iso_639_1"": ""zh"", ""name"": ""\u666e\u901a\u8bdd""}, {""iso_639_1"": ""en"", ""name"": ""English""}]",Released,You Haven't Seen Anything Yet,Now You See Me 2,6.7,3235,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0,0,0,0,3.721125967
430,431,Oblivion,2013,/wiki/Oblivion_(2013_film),"In 2077, sixty years after a war with extraterrestrials that devastated Earth, humanity has relocated to Saturns moon Titan via a giant space station called the Tet. Gigantic offshore fusion energy generators drain Earths oceans to power the colonies on Titan.Led by mission controller Sally and guided by his housemate and communications partner Victoria ""Vika"" Olsen, ""Tech-49"" Jack Harper regularly leaves his tower post to repair downed combat drones that guard the regions and generators against the alien scavengers. Although his memory has been wiped, he has had recurring dreams and visions of being on the observation deck of the Empire State Building with a dark-haired woman. He also collects the occasional artifact that he finds from humanitys past. Vika is concerned about Jacks curiosity, questioning whether they are still ""an effective team,"" and encouraging him to do his job, so they can join the others on Titan soon.After scavengers destroy a generator, Jack discovers that they have been using the Empire State Buildings antenna to transmit coordinates to outer space. While taking a break at his secret lake house retreat, he watches a crash-landing module of a pre-war spacecraft called the Odyssey. Thinking that the ship contains aliens, he investigates, only to find humans in stasis chambers. One of the humans is the woman from his dreams. Jack protects her chamber from a drone that destroys the others, and later, revives the woman, Julia Rusakova, who makes Vika instinctively jealous. Jack and Julia return to recover her flight recorder, but are captured by the scavengers. They are taken to their headquarters at the Raven Rock Mountain Complex, and the scavengers are revealed to be human survivors.Their leader, Malcolm Beech, wants Jack to reprogram their captured drone to carry nuclear fuel cells to blow up the Tet; he has sensed Jack is different because of the latters hobby of collecting relics. Although Jack refuses, Beech releases them to seek the truth beyond the boundaries of the forbidden radiation zone. When they reach the Empire State Building, Julia reveals that she is his wife. Jack then remembers that he proposed to her there. Julia recalls that she was on a mission to Titan when they were diverted to investigate an alien presence.When the two return to Jacks tower, Vika refuses them entry, and reports her findings to Sally, saying they are ""no longer an effective team."" Sally acknowledges this, but activates a drone that kills Vika before Julia shoots it down. Jack and Julia escape in his ship, but are shot down by other pursuing drones. The two eject into the radiation zone, which turns out not to be radioactive. Jack discovers another ship with a technician trying to repair a downed drone, and is shocked to see that the tech is a clone of himself who goes by ""Tech-52"". The clone also is shocked to see Julia. Jack battles and incapacitates his clone, but Julia is accidentally shot. After flying to Tech-52s tower, and discovering an inquisitive Vika clone, he returns to treat Julia then take her to the lake house.At the scavenger base, Beech reveals to Jack and Julia that the Tet was an alien artificial intelligence that destroyed the Moon, causing massive devastation to the planet, and invaded Earth with thousands of Jack clones and drones to wipe out the human race, extracting all of the planets natural resources before moving on. As Jack repairs the captured drone, the base is attacked by other drones, gravely injuring Beech, and ruining the captured drone except for its fuel cells. Jack agrees to deliver Julia to Sally through the stasis chamber. On the way to the Tet, Jack listens to the Odysseys flight recorder, and learns that he was the mission commander, Vika was his co-pilot, and Sally was their mission controller from Earth. When the Tet started to draw in their ship, Jack jettisoned the pod of stasis chambers containing the crew members (including Julia) leaving himself and Vika to be captured.Back in the present, Jack enters a large room full of capsules of Jack and Vika clones. He shows Tet the stasis chamber, but it carries Beech and the fuel cells, which they then detonate, killing themselves and destroying the Tet. On Earth, Julia awakens at the lake house. Three years later, she and her daughter meet the resistance members and ""Tech-52"" Jack, who has also recovered his memories.",120000000,"[{""id"": 28, ""name"": ""Action""}, {""id"": 878, ""name"": ""Science Fiction""}, {""id"": 12, ""name"": ""Adventure""}, {""id"": 9648, ""name"": ""Mystery""}]",https://www.uphe.com/movies/oblivion,75612,"[{""id"": 1612, ""name"": ""spacecraft""}, {""id"": 4565, ""name"": ""dystopia""}, {""id"": 9882, ""name"": ""space""}, {""id"": 11930, ""name"": ""drone""}, {""id"": 156395, ""name"": ""imax""}, {""id"": 186497, ""name"": ""human vs alien""}]",en,"Jack Harper is one of the last few drone repairmen stationed on Earth.

431,432,One Day,2011,/wiki/One_Day_(2011_film),"The film opens with a short scene from the ""current"" day in 2006, which appears later on, before going back 18 years.Dexter Mayhew and Emma Morley meet on 14 July 1988 after their graduation from the University of Edinburgh. They spend the night together but agree to be just friends, and plan to spend the following day together, the 15th, St. Swithuns day. The film chronologically reconnects Dexter, Emma or both of them on that one day over the next 18 years after they go their separate ways.One year later in 1989, Dexter helps Emma move into a flat in London where she plans to pursue a career as a writer. However, after little success, she ends up working as a waitress in a Mexican restaurant by 1990, and meets Ian, an aspiring comedian who is hired soon after. Dexter is travelling the world while drinking and having sex promiscuously with a succession of girlfriends, but they keep in contact via phonecalls and letters. He then visits Emma on 15 July 1991 and, to get her out of her rut, suggests they go away for the weekend. They flirt back and forth and its made clear that Emma may have deeper feelings for him, but since she knows that Dexter is not boyfriend material, nothing comes of it and two more years fly by. Dexter is now a wealthy and successful television presenter on a raucous late-night television show, where he meets Suki, who later becomes his new girlfriend.Dexter visits his parents on 15 July 1994 after his mother has been diagnosed with cancer and is terminally ill. He arrives at the family home still under the influence of drugs and alcohol from heavy partying the night before, which his father notices and is furious about, telling Dexter he will ban him from visiting again if he keeps it up. Also, his mother appears very unimpressed with the nature of his television show and reveals that she no longer believes he is a nice man. On the same day, Emma goes out on a date with Ian. Although there appears to be no romantic spark between them, she knows he means well and so they continue to date anyway.By 1995, Emma is now a school teacher and has moved in with Ian. However, she grows more and more irritated with him because of his lack of ambition and failure to contribute to maintaining their household. Dexter is the presenter of another television show, which isnt doing so well, making him ""the most annoying man on telly"". On 15 July 1996, he and Emma meet for dinner. He turns up high on cocaine, leaves the table every ten minutes, flirts with another woman down the hall, and insults Emma. She storms off and, out in the street, decides that they must break off their friendship due to them outgrowing each other. She tells him that although she loves him, she no longer likes him anymore.Two years later, Dexters television career has gone into a steep decline because he is 32 years old and television executives prefer presenters in their early 20s. Meanwhile, Emma and Ian have split up and she becomes a published author of childrens books. By 1999, Dexter is in a long-term relationship with Sylvie. On 15 July 2000, Emmas former university roommate and Dexters old best friend get married, and both Emma and Dexter are invited to the wedding. There, Dexter receives a job offer from Calum, his old roommate who has since become a multimillionaire from owning a chain of organic food restaurants. Dexter and Emma leave the party to talk on the rooftop, where he tells her about Sylvie, who is now his fiancée, and is on his way to becoming a father. Emma tries to hide the fact that she is upset and they share a very brief but meaningful kiss.By 2001, Dexter is a father but later learns that Sylvie is having an affair with Calum and they divorce. Two years pass and Emma has moved to Paris, where Dexter visits her on 15 July in the hope that they will get together again, this time for good. It is revealed that they had a one-night stand after his marriage to Sylvie broke down. However, Emma reveals that she has a new boyfriend (Sébastien Dupuis), a French musician who plays piano in a jazz band. Smitten with Emma but taken aback by the revelation that she has moved on, Dexter decides to leave. Suddenly, she has second thoughts and chases after him, exclaiming that she thought she had gotten rid of him. He promises to never hurt, lie to or cheat on her, and they share a passionate kiss and finally start a full relationship together.Emma and Dexter become engaged in 2004 and eventually marry. Parlaying his restaurant experience into a new career, Dexter opens his own cafe in England, which proves to be very lucrative, and he and Emma start trying to have their own baby. However, they are unsuccessful and become frustrated with one another. On 15 July 2006 (the scene from the very beginning of the movie), Emma is hit by a truck while riding her bicycle out of a blind alley, and she dies. Dexter becomes inconsolable and self-destructive, and is particularly desolate each year on their day. Over the years, he gets support from his ex-wife, their daughter Jasmine, his widowed father, and even Ian, who also mourns Emma every year. Ian has since married and had children, but he visits Dexter and tells him that Emma was never the same with him as she was with Dexter, that she ""lit up"" whenever Dexter was around, and that ""she made you decent and you made her so happy"".On 15 July 2011, Dexter visits Arthurs Seat in Scotland with Jasmine.

434,435,Our Idiot Brother,2011,/wiki/Our_Idiot_Brother,"Ned Rochlin (Paul Rudd) is a biodynamic farmer living with his girlfriend, Janet (Kathryn Hahn). While selling produce at a local market, Ned sells marijuana to a uniformed police officer due to the officers claim that he had a stressful week, which made Ned feel sympathetic after initially being skeptical. Ned is then arrested on a charge of selling drugs.Ned has three sisters: Miranda (Elizabeth Banks) the middle sister, is a journalist for Vanity Fair trying to get her first major article published. Though she has trouble finding a man to keep her interest, she and a neighbor, Jeremy (Adam Scott) have hidden feelings for each other. Natalie (Zooey Deschanel), the youngest, is an independent, bisexual hipster living with her girlfriend, Cindy (Rashida Jones), and five other roommates. Liz (Emily Mortimer), the oldest, is married to Dylan (Steve Coogan), a documentary filmmaker. Their marriage is failing as Dylan shows no sexual or emotional interest in Liz. They also have strict control over their son River (Matthew Mindler), which leaves him unhappy and unable to express himself.When Ned is released from prison, he returns home to his girl and his dog (""Willie Nelson""). He finds that she is living with Billy (T. J. Miller), and no longer wishes to continue their relationship or allow him to work at the farm. Billy gives Ned a ride into town and tells him that if he can scrape together $1000 for the first 2 months rent, Janet might let him stay in the goat barn behind the farm. Ned initially stays at his mothers house but a few days later shows up at Lizs place, asking if he can stay with her. He is put in Rivers room and told that he must help around the house and work with Dylan on his newest documentary about a Russian ballerina named Tatiana (Lydia Haug).The next day, Miranda reluctantly asks Ned to chauffeur while she interviews an important client, Lady Arabella (Janet Montgomery). Miranda hopes to pry into her scandalous past, but is dismayed to learn of a legal agreement to only ask about charity work. Miranda tries to pretend Ned isnt there, but his friendliness charms Arabella, who takes a liking to him. That night, Ned goes with Natalie to a self-help meeting with Natalies artist friend, Christian (Hugh Dancy). Christian is attracted to Natalie but is dissuaded by her lesbian relationship until Ned informs him that she is bisexual and likes guys too. Christian and Natalie take a cab home and end up having sex.Ned goes back to working with Dylan, but is told to watch the car while Dylan conducts a private interview with Tatiana. Hours later, Ned is told by a police officer to move out of a tow zone. Running upstairs to get the keys he discovers Dylan naked with Tatiana. Dylan later says the only reason he was naked was to make Tatiana feel more ""comfortable"" while being naked, which Ned believes. The next night, Ned goes with Miranda to Arabellas benefit dinner, and stays behind to have a conversation with Arabella. She explains the gossipy part of her life (that Miranda had hoped to discover) to Ned, who listens with interest. Ned is later kicked out of Lizs house because, at an important school interview, River tells the interviewer that Ned just got out of jail for selling drugs to a policeman. Ned apologizes, stating he was only trying to help River be himself. Now staying with Miranda, Ned casually mentions Dylans nude interview with Tatiana and Miranda concludes that Dylan is having an affair. Ned also mentions a personal detail about Arabella that makes Miranda realize that Ned has the info she needs. She forces Ned to tell her the details, which Ned is ashamed to do since he was trusted. Ned returns to the farm with the rent money but Janet doesnt allow him to rent the barn, or leave with his dog.Ned asks Cindy, who is a lawyer, about ways to get custody of his dog but she suggests as an alternative that they work together to simply take the dog from Janet. He later goes out to lunch with Jeremy and hints at Jeremys attraction towards his sister. Jeremy explains that Miranda is too bossy for him, though admitting she is beautiful. Ned mentions the idea to Miranda, who is hurt to learn what Jeremy had to say and tells Ned her thoughts on Jeremy, leading to a fight between the two. Natalie later confides in Ned that she is pregnant. Miranda and Nat try to tell Liz about Dylans affair but Liz becomes angry and the conversation turns into an argument between the three about their personal lives. Liz later confronts Dylan about the affair, and he blames her attempts at pleasing him. Liz is angry that he is blaming her for his infidelity, and divorces him.Miranda takes Ned into work the next day as she needs him to vouch for the veracity of her article. Ned reads the article but doesnt want to sign a release as he knows Arabella had told him the details in confidence.  The editor calls in the company lawyer and decide they cant publish Mirandas article without Ned vouching for it, which he refuses to do. She kicks Ned out and he stays with Nat, who lies about having told Cindy about the cheating. The next morning, Cindy and Ned drive to the farm to steal his dog back. They sneak into the house but Ned casually brings up Nats infidelity and Cindy angrily calls Nat from inside the house, which alerts Janet to their presence. Janet refuses to give Ned his dog and Cindy drives away, leaving Ned behind.Ned goes to his parole officer, Omar, and thinking he can trust him, tells him that the stress of his life was getting to him and he smoked marijuana with a neighbor. Omar tells Ned now he must report him. Ned goes home to a family dinner and is blamed by his sisters for all the trouble in their lives. Ned finally loses his temper and yells at them for their selfishness and for bringing everyone else down which seems to strike a chord with them. Omar arrives with an officer to reluctantly take Ned into custody. Miranda posts Neds bail, but he refuses to sign his release form, opting to stay in prison rather than be with the girls. They devise a plan to get Willie Nelson from Janet in order to get him to leave. Although Janet refuses, Billy comes out of the house carrying Willie Nelson, tired of Janet refusing to give Ned his dog. They take Willie Nelson to the prison where he is reunited with Ned, motivating him to leave prison.A few weeks later, Ned is out to lunch with his sisters. Nat receives a call from Cindy, who wants to go with Nat to her gynecologist appointments for support. Miranda has patched things up and started a relationship with Jeremy. Liz has decided to start dating again and has started letting River be himself. Meanwhile, Ned and Billy have opened up a small homemade candle shop together. One day, Ned cannot find Willie Nelson and begins running through town looking for him. He finds Willie playing with another dog who has also run away from her owner.

435,436,Pacific Rim,2013,/wiki/Pacific_Rim_(film),"In 2013, an interdimensional portal called the ""Breach"" opens at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean, from which giant monsters, the Kaiju, emerge. To combat the Kaiju threat, humanity builds massive robotic machines called Jaegers. Each Jaeger is piloted by two or more people, who are mentally linked in a process called ""Drifting"", to share the mental stress of piloting the machine.In 2020, the Becket brothers, Raleigh and Yancy, pilots of Gipsy Danger, are launched to defend Anchorage from Knifehead, a Category III Kaiju. Defying direct orders from command, they engage the monster rather than protect the coastline. Knifehead kills Yancy, and Raleigh barely manages to pilot the Jaeger on his own, killing the Kaiju before crashing it at a shoreline. Traumatized by Yancys death, Raleigh quits the Jaeger program. Five years later, the increasing power and number of Kaiju attacks cause the world governments to cease funding the continuous construction of Jaegers in favor of building coastal walls, and Marshal Stacker Pentecost moves all four remaining Jaegers to the last Jaeger Shatterdome in Hong Kong and plans to end the Kaiju War by destroying the Breach with a nuclear weapon. As Striker Eureka, piloted by Herc Hansen and his son Chuck, kills Mutavore, a Category IV Kaiju, in Sydney, demonstrating the ineffectiveness of the walls, Pentecost persuades Raleigh to rejoin the program and they arrive at Hong Kong and meet Mako Mori, director of the Jaeger restoration program. After finding her compatible, Raleigh and Mako try their first drift, but Mako ends up nearly destroying the Shatterdome while lost in the memory of a Category II Kaiju attacking Tokyo and killing her family, and is relieved of piloting duty. It is revealed that after this incident, Mako was saved and raised by Pentecost.Pentecost consults Kaiju experts Newton Geiszler and Hermann Gottlieb to plan the assault on the Breach. Newton is able to drift with a piece of a Kaiju brain, discovering the Kaiju are scouts sent by invading beings from another dimension, and establishing a two-way mental link that enables the Kaiju hive mind to gain access to his knowledge just as he did theirs. Pentecost tasks Newton with finding a black market dealer and seller of body parts of dead Kaiju, Hannibal Chau, to find a fresh Kaiju brain. Suddenly, two Category IV Kaijus, Leatherback and Otachi, emerge and rampage through Hong Kong to kill Newton. After Otachi destroys Crimson Typhoon and Leatherback destroys Cherno Alpha, Striker Eureka loses all power by Leatherbacks EMP blast. Gipsy Danger is finally sent and slays both Kaiju. Newton and Chau find out that Otachi is pregnant, and the infant Kaiju dies shortly after swallowing Chau whole. Newton and Hermann drift with the infants brain, discovering the Breach will only open in the presence of a Kaijus DNA.As Herc was injured during the previous fight, Pentecost, who is dying from radiation sickness from piloting a Jaeger with a nuclear core before the implementation of radiation shielding, gives a rallying speech and pilots Striker Eureka with Chuck. Along with Gipsy Danger, they approach the Breach and are warned by Newton and Hermann of what they discovered from drifting with the infants brain. Three Kaiju, two Category IV called Scunner and Raiju and a first Category V named Slattern, emerge from the Breach to defend it. After Raiju is killed, Pentecost and Chuck sacrifice themselves by detonating the bomb, which kills Scunner and mortally wounds Slattern. Raleigh and Mako kill Slattern and drag it to the Breach, where Mako is ejected and Raleigh successfully overloads the Jaegers reactor, destroying and closing the Breach. As Raleigh and Makos escape pods surface in the Pacific Ocean, Herc orders the war clock to be stopped, indicating mankinds victory and Raleigh and Mako embrace.In a mid-credits scene, Chau is shown cutting his way out of the Kaiju infant, looking for his lost shoe.",180000000,"[{""id"": 28, ""name"": ""Action""}, {""id"": 878, ""name"": ""Science Fiction""}, {""id"": 12, ""name"": ""Adventure""}]",http://www.pacificrimmovie.com/,68726,"[{""id"": 4565, ""name"": ""dystopia""}, {""id"": 10891, ""name"": ""giant robot""}, {""id"": 11100, ""name"": ""giant monster""}, {""id"": 12332, ""name"": ""apocalypse""}, {""id"": 156395, ""name"": ""imax""}, {""id"": 179431, ""name"": ""duringcreditsstinger""}, {""id"": 209714, ""name"": ""3d""}]",en,"When legions of monstrous creatures, known as Kaiju, started rising from the sea, a war began that would take millions of lives and consume humanity's resources for years on end.

436,437,Paddington,2015,/wiki/Paddington_(film),"In the deep jungles of darkest Peru, British geographer Montgomery Clyde happens upon a previously unknown species of bear. He is about to shoot it to take back a specimen to the United Kingdom when another bear playfully takes his gun away. He learns that this family of bears is intelligent and can learn English, and that they have a deep appetite for marmalade. He names them Lucy and Pastuzo. As he departs, he throws his hat to Pastuzo and tells the bears that they are always welcome should they wish to go to London.Several years later, the two bears are living in harmony with their nephew when an earthquake strikes their home, forcing them to seek shelter underground. After being trapped by a falling tree, Uncle Pastuzo is unable to reach the shelter in time and dies from his injuries. The next morning, Uncle Pastuzos hat is found by his nephew. Aunt Lucy encourages her nephew to go and find solace in London, and stows him away on a cargo ship, after which she says she will move into the Home for Retired Bears.The young bear reaches Londons Paddington Station, where he meets the Brown family, who take him home temporarily and name him after the station. Henry Brown, the father and a devoted risk analyst, does not believe a word of why hes here and is adamant that Paddington stay only one night while they find a place for him to live permanently, but his wife Mary - a story illustrator - and their two children find him endearing, as does family relative and housekeeper Mrs. Bird.Paddington thinks he can find a home with the explorer who found Aunt Lucy and Uncle Pastuzo, but does not know his name. Since there seems to be no word of his expedition anywhere on the Internet, Mary takes Paddington to Mr. Gruber, an antique shop owner who discovers that the hat bears the stamp of the Geographers Guild, but the Guild says that it never sent a member to explore darkest Peru. With the help of Henry, Paddington infiltrates the Geographers Guild archives and discovers an expedition to Peru was undertaken by Montgomery Clyde. He uses the citys phone books to track the addresses of all the ""M. Clydes"" in London.Meanwhile, the hateful museum taxidermist Director Millicent Clyde captures, kills, and stuffs exotic animals to house in the Natural History Museum. When she becomes aware of Paddington, she immediately sets out to hunt him down. The Brown family departs for the day, leaving Paddington home alone. Scheming with the Browns nosy next-door neighbor Mr. Curry, Millicent sneaks in and attempts to capture Paddington; he manages to defend himself, but inadvertently starts a fire in the kitchen in the process. Disbelieving Paddingtons statement of Millicents capture attempt, Henry states that he must move into a new home as soon as possible and Mary reluctantly agrees.Feeling unwanted at the Browns, Paddington leaves and attempts to track down Montgomery Clyde himself. He finally locates the house, only to learn that Clyde died years ago, and that Millicent is Clydes daughter. She resents her father for losing his job and membership with the museum; out of a change of heart, he refused to bring a valuable Peruvian bear specimen home, even though it would have made his family wealthy. Millicent is determined to succeed where her father failed and capture a Peruvian bear so she can become rich and famous herself. She tranquilizes Paddington and prepares to stuff him, but when Mr. Curry discovers her true intentions, he informs the Brown family and they rush to save Paddington. They rescue him, and Paddington subdues Millicent by throwing a marmalade sandwich at her which Uncle Pastuzo left in his hat for emergencies. This attracts a huge flock of pigeons, distracting her, as Mrs. Bird opens a roof hatch and pushes her off the roof, trapping her on a flagpole.In the aftermath, the Browns allow Paddington to move in with their family and Millicent is arrested and sentenced to community service at the petting zoo her father opened after he lost his job.

437,438,Paranormal Activity,2010,/wiki/Paranormal_Activity,"Young couple Katie and Micah move to a new house in San Diego. Katie claims an evil presence has been haunting her since she was a child, so Micah sets up a camera in their bedroom to record any paranormal activity that occurs while they sleep. A famous psychic Dr. Fredrichs, who reveals that Katie is being haunted by a demon that feeds off of negative energy and is intent on tormenting Katie,  advises them not to communicate with the demon and to contact demonologist Dr. Johann Averies if needed. Katie seems interested, but Micah does not take this seriously.The camera manages to capture many strange occurrences, which are minor at first, such as noises, flickering lights, and doors moving on their own. However, Micah taunts and mocks the demon, worsening the situation. During the thirteenth night, the demon angrily screeches and there is a loud thud, causing the entire house to vibrate. Voice recorder tests are conducted by Micah the following morning, which reveal demonic grunting when Micah asks if it would like to use a Ouija board. During the fifteenth night, Katie, in an apparent trance, stands beside the bed and stares at Micah for two hours before going outside. Micah tries to convince Katie to go back inside, but she refuses and appears to remember none of it the next day.Micah brings home a Ouija board, which infuriates Katie. When they leave the house, the camera records an unseen force moving the planchette to form an unknown message on the Ouija board, which then spontaneously catches fire. Katie sees the video and pleads with Micah to contact the demonologist, but again he refuses. During the seventeenth night, Micah sprinkles baby powder in the hallway and outside the bedroom door. The couple are awakened by creaks, and find non-human footprints leading to the attic, where Micah finds a burnt photograph of a young Katie (same picture from the second film). Katie finally calls the demonologist, Dr. Averies, but he is out of the country.The events of the seventeenth night have psychologically terrified the couple, which in turn has strengthened the demon. Over the next few nights, the paranormal activity is excessive and intense. They eventually call Dr. Fredrichs back to the house, but he is overwhelmed by the demonic energy upon entering. He apologetically leaves despite their pleas, stating that his presence only makes the demon angrier. The bleak reality causes the couple to lose all hope, which makes the demon strong enough to be able to pull Katie out of the bedroom and bite her, causing her to become fully possessed. Micah discovers the bite mark and—deciding events are too out of control to remain in the house—he packs to head to a motel. Just as they are set to leave, the possessed Katie insists they will be okay now.The following night, Katie gets out of bed and stares at Micah for two hours before going downstairs. After a moment of silence, Katie screams for Micah; he abruptly rushes to help her. Afterward, Micah exclaims in pain, Katie stops screaming, and then heavy footsteps are heard coming upstairs. Suddenly, Micahs body is violently hurled at the camera, which is knocked off the tripod, revealing a demonic Katie standing in the doorway. She slowly walks into the room, stained with blood, and crawls to Micahs body, then looks up at the camera with a grin. As she lunges toward the camera, her face takes on a demonic appearance just as the scene cuts to black.

442,443,ParaNorman,2012,/wiki/ParaNorman,"In the small town of Blithe Hollow, Massachusetts, Norman Babcock is an 11-year-old boy who speaks with the dead, including his late grandmother and various ghosts in town. Almost no one believes him and he is isolated emotionally from his family while being ridiculed by his peers. His best friend, Neil Downe, is an overweight boy who is bullied himself and finds in Norman a kindred spirit. After rehearsal of a school play commemorating the towns execution of a witch three centuries ago, the boys are confronted by Normans estranged and seemingly deranged uncle, Mr. Prenderghast, who tells his nephew that he soon must take up his regular ritual to protect the town. Soon after this encounter, Mr. Prenderghast dies.During the official performance of the school play, Norman has a vision of the towns past in which he is pursued through the woods by townsfolk on a witch hunt, embarrassing himself and leading to a heated argument with his father Perry, who later grounds him. His mother Sandra tells him that his fathers stern manner is because he is afraid for him. The next day, Norman sees Prenderghasts spirit who tells him that the ritual must be performed with a certain book before sundown that day; then making him swear to complete the task, Prenderghasts spirit is set free and crosses over. Norman is at first reluctant to go because he is scared but his grandmother tells him it is all right to be scared as long as he does not let it change who he is. Norman sets off to retrieve the book from Prenderghasts house (having to take it from his corpse).He then goes to the graves of the five men and two women who were cursed by the witch, but finds that the book is merely a series of fairy tales. Alvin, a school bully, arrives and prevents Norman from reading the story before sundown. Norman attempts to continue reading from the book, to no effect. A ghostly storm resembling the witch appears in the air, summoning the cursed dead to arise as zombies, who chase the boys along with Normans 17-year-old sister, Courtney; and Neils older brother Mitch, down the hill and into town. Having realized that the witch was not buried in the graveyard, Norman contacts classmate Salma (who tells them to access the Town Halls archives for the location of the witchs unmarked grave) for help. As the kids make their way to the Town Hall, the zombies are attacked by the citizenry. During the riot, Norman and his companions break into the archives but cannot find the information they need. As the mob moves to attack Town Hall, the witch storm appears over the crowd. Norman climbs the Halls tower to read the book, in a last-ditch effort to finish the ritual, but the witch strikes the book with lightning, hurling Norman from the tower and deep into the archives.Unconscious, Norman has a dream where he learns that the witch was Agatha ""Aggie"" Prenderghast, a little girl of his age who was also a medium. Norman realizes that Aggie was wrongfully convicted by the town council when they mistook her powers for witchcraft. After awakening, Norman encounters the zombies and recognizes them as the town council who convicted Aggie. The zombies and their leader, the late Judge Hopkins admit that they only wanted to speak with him to ensure that he would take up the ritual, to minimize the damage of the mistake they made so long ago. Norman attempts to help the zombies slip away so they can guide him to Aggies grave, but is cornered by the mob. Courtney, Mitch, Neil, and Alvin rally to Normans side and confront the crowd, arguing that their rage, fear, and misunderstanding make them no different than the cursed townsfolk from long ago. Although the mob calms down, the witch unleashes her powers to create greater havoc throughout the town.Judge Hopkins guides Normans family to the grave in a forest. Before the grave is reached, Aggies magical powers separate Norman from the others. Norman finds the grave and interacts with Aggies vengeful spirit, determined to stop the cataclysmic tantrum she has been having over the years. Though she attempts to push him away Norman holds his ground, telling her that he understands how she feels as an outcast, that her vengeance has only made her like the ones who wronged her, and eventually forcing her to remember happier days. Having finally encountered someone who understands her plight and by remembering her caring mother, Aggie is able to find a measure of peace and cross over to the afterlife (having the opportunity to be reunited with her mother). The storm dissipates, and she, the zombies and even the Judge all fade away. The town cleans up and regards Norman as a hero. In the end, Norman watches a horror film with the ghost of his grandmother and his family, who have grown to accept Norman for who he is.",60000000,"[{""id"": 10751, ""name"": ""Family""}, {""id"": 16, ""name"": ""Animation""}, {""id"": 12, ""name"": ""Adventure""}, {""id"": 35, ""name"": ""Comedy""}]",http://paranorman.com,77174,"[{""id"": 2723, ""name"": ""medium""}, {""id"": 10121, ""name"": ""stop motion""}, {""id"": 10541, ""name"": ""curse""}, {""id"": 10623, ""name"": ""jock""}, {""id"": 162846, ""name"": ""ghost""}, {""id"": 175387, ""name"": ""communicating with the dead""}, {""id"": 179430, ""name"": ""aftercreditsstinger""}, {""id"": 181755, ""name"": ""dealing with the past""}, {""id"": 181820, ""name"": ""witch trial""}, {""id"": 181822, ""name"": ""child witch""}, {""id"": 181834, ""name"": ""empathy""}, {""id"": 215191, ""name"": ""strange""}]",en,"In the town of Blithe Hollow, Norman Babcock is a boy who can speak to the dead, but no one besides his eccentric new friend, Neil, believes his ability is real.

While driving on a remote desert highway at night, after a tense situation with some rednecks in a diner, Graeme and Clive observe a car driving erratically and then crashing. They stop to investigate and offer assistance to the driver, who turns out to be an alien named Paul. Clive faints, but Graeme agrees to assist Paul and gives him a ride.Later, Special Agent Zoil of the FBI arrives at the car-crash site and informs his unseen female superior, ""the Big Guy"", that he is closing in on Paul. She sends two inept rookies, Haggard and OReilly, to assist Zoil.Clive wakes up in the RV, he then tries to strangle Paul until Graeme calms him down. Paul tells them that the government spoon fed his image to the public to keep them from panicking if anyone encounters his race. They later camp at an RV park run by two Christian fundamentalists, one-eyed Ruth Buggs and her father, Moses. The next day, when Ruth discovers Paul, the three are forced to take her with them. During an argument, Paul convinces Ruth to question her beliefs. Paul later uses his healing power to cure Ruths blinded eye. The fugitives stop at a bar and Ruth tries to call Moses, but Zoil intercepts the call. She is accosted by the rednecks from the diner, and a bar fight ensues. The group escapes when Paul terrifies the rednecks into fainting. Later, at another RV park, Ruth is questioned by Agent Zoil, but claims to know nothing about ""a one-eyed girl"" or ""two British nerds"". Released, Graeme and she retrieve Clive and Paul, who narrowly escape Haggard and OReilly. Frustrated, Zoil orders Haggard and OReilly to return to base, but they go behind his back and insist on catching the alien on their own.The group soon arrives at a house owned by Tara, who rescued Paul when he crashed on Earth 60 years ago and accidentally killed her dog (Who Paul was named after) in the crash, and as a result of no one believing her story, has spent her life as a pariah. As she makes tea for her visitors, Haggard, OReilly, and Zoil surround the house. The fugitives flee, but OReilly shoots at them, igniting gas from Taras stove and destroying her house. OReilly is apparently killed in the explosion. Haggard pursues and catches up to the RV. Due to an error in judgement, Haggard drives off a cliff and is killed. Zoil reassures the Big Guy that he will have Paul within the hour, but she is tired of waiting and informs Zoil that she has ordered a ""military response"".Paul, Graeme, Clive, Ruth, and Tara arrive at Devils Tower National Monument, where they set off fireworks as a signal to Pauls mothership. A helicopter suddenly arrives with agents and the Big Guy. Zoil then appears and initiates a stand-off, disabling the agents, but is then wounded by the Big Guy. Secretly, Zoil is Pauls friend and was attempting to aid his escape under the guise of capturing the alien. The group fights the Big Guy and Tara knocks her out. Moses arrives unexpectedly and fires his shotgun, intending to kill Paul, but Graeme jumps in front of Paul and Ruth and is fatally wounded. Paul once again uses his healing powers, reviving Graeme in spite of the danger to himself. Graeme and Ruth admit their feelings for each other and kiss, but then the Big Guy regains consciousness and holds the group at gunpoint. Just as the Big Guy is about to kill them, she is crushed by a suddenly arriving spaceship. Paul says goodbye to his friends but before he goes, he offers Tara a chance to go with him, promising to give her a new life after ruining her childhood and accidentally killing her dog.

444,445,Paul Blart: Mall Cop,2015,/wiki/Paul_Blart:_Mall_Cop,"Paul Blart lives in West Orange, New Jersey, with his teenage daughter, Maya, and mother, Margaret. Aspiring to join the New Jersey State Police, he trains at the police academy, but his hypoglycemic medical condition causes him to collapse, therefore failing the exam. To shape up for his career, Blart works as a security guard at the fictional West Orange Pavilion Mall.Blart patrols the mall on a Segway to assure that things are safe and clean. He also trains Veck Simms, who is new but uninterested in the job. Meanwhile, Blart becomes acquainted with Amy Anderson, the vendor of a new kiosk. He meets her one evening at a party at Joes American Bar and Grill with other mall employees. Things initially go well, but Blart is sidetracked when he decides to participate in a nacho-eating contest with his friend Leon. The hot and spicy salsa is more than Blart can handle, causing him to inadvertently drink several alcoholic beverages. He ruins the party and makes a wild exit by falling through a window.Two days later, on the night of Black Friday, an organized gang of thugs disguised as Santas Village employees begin what appears to be a bank heist inside the mall. They take Amy and other customers in the bank hostage. Simms is revealed as the gangs leader – his mall security job was a ploy to gather intelligence. They are keeping the hostages as insurance for the gangs escape. The crew force shoppers to exit the mall and strategically place motion sensors around each entrance to detect any attempt to enter or exit the building. Blart takes a break in the arcade and plays ""Detroit Rock City"" via Rock Band. He eventually walks back out in the mall, and discovers the entire mall is evacuated and under a state of emergency. Upon realizing this, he calls the police, and slips out of the mall to speak with Commander Sergeant Howard. Blart realizes Amy is still inside after spotting her car in the parking lot, and decides to return to the mall to look for her. A SWAT team arrives with Commander James Kent at the helm. Kent, a former classmate and bully from Blarts childhood, takes control of the police units and orders Blart to let them handle the situation. Blart refuses and attempts a rescue. Vastly outnumbered and physically outclassed, Blart takes a stand against Simms crew using improvised measures to take them down one by one. He discovers credit card codes written in invisible ink on the burglars arms and realizes that their real plans go beyond robbing the bank.Maya, unaware of what has happened, shows up at the mall on her way to bring Blart some food, but Simms remaining henchmen seize her and add her to the hostage group. Blart manages to subdue all of Simms accomplices and attempts to evacuate the hostages by pulling them up through an air vent. The plan fails when Leon does not fit. Simms enters the room, capturing Blart and forcing him to give up the credit card codes he recorded on his cell phone. Simms flees, taking Amy and Maya with him. As police raid the mall to apprehend the criminals and rescue the hostages, Blart borrows a display minivan and joins Kent in pursuing Simms to the airport, where he is attempting to escape to the Cayman Islands.After a brief scuffle, Blart overpowers Simms and puts him in handcuffs. Moments later, however, Kent pulls his gun on Blart, revealing that he was in cahoots with Simms. Kent demands the phone containing the codes from Blart, who refuses and destroys the phone. Before Kent can retaliate by shooting Blart, Chief Brooks of the mall security team arrives and shoots Kent in the arm. Kent and Simms are arrested, and Amy and Maya are returned safely. For his bravery and assistance, Howard offers Blart a job with the West Orange Police Department. Blart inexplicably declines, preferring to remain in mall security. Blart and Amy are eventually married in the mall, where they exchange vows on a set of black and white Segways.",26000000,"[{""id"": 28, ""name"": ""Action""}, {""id"": 12, ""name"": ""Adventure""}, {""id"": 35, ""name"": ""Comedy""}, {""id"": 10751, ""name"": ""Family""}]",http://paulblartmallcop.com/,14560,"[{""id"": 41180, ""name"": ""security guard""}, {""id"": 179431, ""name"": ""duringcreditsstinger""}]",en,"Mild-mannered Paul Blart (Kevin James) has always had huge dreams of becoming a State Trooper.

445,446,Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters,2013,/wiki/Percy_Jackson:_Sea_of_Monsters,"While in Camp Half-Blood, Percy recounts the story of Thalia and her sacrifice. A young Annabeth, Luke, Grover and Thalia are running to Camp Half-Blood while being pursued by monsters. Thalia sacrifices herself to get the others into the camp, and her father Zeus turns her into a tree which forms a barrier around it.The campers realize that Thalias tree has been poisoned by Luke and they are vulnerable to attacks. Percy visits the Oracle, who tells him of a prophecy of a half-blood of the eldest gods either saving or destroying Olympus. Chiron tells Percy that he is the only living, human half-blood of the eldest gods, so the half-blood in the Prophecy may refer to him. Annabeth and Grover learn about the Golden Fleece, which has the power to heal anything, and propose a quest in which they retrieve the Fleece and use it to heal Thalias tree. Mr. D chooses Clarisse to lead the quest, much to Annabeths and Percys dismay. Percy convinces Grover and Annabeth to accompany him on the quest, and Tyson joins them. Annabeth hails the Chariot of Damnation, and Percy threatens the three drivers (the Graeae) to tell him of his prophecy, giving him coordinates for the Sea of Monsters (the Bermuda Triangle) before ejecting the group from the cab in Washington D.C. because they lack money. While walking down the street, Grover is kidnapped by Chris Rodriguez and taken to Luke. Percy, Annabeth, and Tyson first locate Luke with the help of Hermes, then ride a Hippokampos to his yacht, the Andromeda. Luke reveals his plan to revive Kronos using the Fleece so Olympus will be destroyed. Percy and they are then locked in the brig, though they later escape when Percy uses his ability to manipulate water.The group is consumed by Charybdis, and they discover Clarisse in the monsters stomach. Percy and Clarisse work together to escape Charybdis by shooting a hole through its gut, and soon they arrive at Circeland, Polyphemuss lair. Percy finds Grover, and the five escape Polyphemus, retrieving the fleece and trapping him in his cave. Afterwards, Luke arrives and demands the fleece from Percy, who refuses. Luke shoots a crossbow bolt at Percy, but Tyson takes the bolt in the chest and falls into the water below.Luke begins reviving Kronos and Annabeth encourages Percy to take leadership. The team escapes captivity, and Percy grapples with Luke over the Fleece, like the prophecy said they would, but Luke easily gains the upper hand. Luke is suddenly thrown away by Tyson, revealed to have survived his wound due to the water healing it, as he is Poseidons son. Kronos rises from the sarcophagus and consumes Luke and Grover before battling Percy. Percy realizes that Riptide is the ""cursed blade"" of the prophecy and slices Kronos into pieces imprisoning Kronos in the sarcophagus once again, causing him to regurgitate Grover and Luke, the latter landing in Polyphemuss Lair. Their victory is short lived as Annabeth is stabbed by the Manticore, who is killed in turn by Clarisse and Grover. Annabeth dies in Percys arms but is resurrected by the Fleece.

A high-ranking officer immediately closes the project and deems marijuana illegal.Seventy-one years later, Dale Denton, a 25-year-old process server and habitual marijuana smoker, visits the home of his drug dealer, Saul Silver, to buy marijuana. Saul tells him that he may already know the identity of Dales next customer, Ted Jones. Dale drives to Teds house and witnesses Ted and a police officer, Carol Brazier, shoot a man to death. While fleeing the area, Dale leaves behind his roach, which contains a rare strain of marijuana called Pineapple Express. Ted identifies the strain and sends his two henchmen, Budlofsky and Matheson, to a dealer, Red, who tells them that he has only sold the pot to Saul.At Sauls apartment, Dale learns that Ted is a dangerous drug lord and could trace the roach. Dale and Saul flee into the nearby woods while Teds henchmen persuade Red to arrange a meeting with Saul. They accidentally fall asleep in Dales car and wake up to find that they missed their meeting with Red. They leave the woods and arrive at Reds house, hoping to determine whether Ted has linked them with the Pineapple Express. Red says Ted is not after them. Dale realizes that he is lying and knocks him out. They wake Red and question him until he reveals that Ted has discovered who they are and that he is going to kill them. Dale and Saul decide that they must leave the city.To leave town, Dale and Saul sell Pineapple Express to raise bus fare. However, a police officer named Barber sees Dale and arrests him. In the back of the cruiser, Dale tries to convince Barber that Brazier is corrupt and tells her that he witnessed her and Ted murder a man. Barber recognizes Brazier and promises him that she will investigate her soon because Barber had been long suspicious of Braziers corruption. However, Saul leaps in front of the police car and hijacks it, thinking that Brazier is the one who is driving. Brazier hears a police radio call of Dales arrest and pursues Dale and Saul in a high-speed chase, but they escape. After an argument about their situation, Dale and Saul split up Dale hurts Sauls feelings and tries to tell Saul that he didnt mean what Dale said to Saul.

Dale and Saul free themselves but are caught by Matheson. Matheson grazes Dales ear with a gunshot, but he is disarmed and shot by Saul. Dale and Saul join the fight, and a brawl ensues between Dale and Ted. When Budlofsky refuses to kill Saul, Matheson emerges from the lair and shoots him in the chest, killing him. He turns around to kill Saul, but Red drives through the barn and saves Saul by hitting Matheson with his Daewoo Lanos. Red seems to be shot to death by Brazier. One of the mobsters activates a bomb, resulting in Teds death, and setting fire to the barn. When Reds car explodes, it flips over and lands on Brazier, killing her. The explosion incapacitates Saul, but Dale finds him and carries him from the burning barn. Red, wounded but still alive, also escapes and reconciles with them.

447,448,Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,2011,/wiki/Pirates_of_the_Caribbean:_On_Stranger_Tides,"After a failed attempt to rescue his first mate, Joshamee Gibbs, in London, Captain Jack Sparrow is brought before King George II. The king wants Jack to guide an expedition to the Fountain of Youth before King Ferdinand and the Spanish Navy can locate it. Jacks old nemesis, Captain Hector Barbossa, now a privateer in service to the British Navy after losing his leg and ship, the Black Pearl, which he says was sunk, is heading the expedition.Jack refuses the offer and escapes. He meets up with his father, Captain Teague, who warns Jack about the Fountains rituals. Jack learns someone is impersonating him to recruit a crew to find the Fountain. The impostor is Angelica, Jacks former lover, and the daughter of the ruthless pirate Blackbeard, who practices voodoo magic and wields the mythical ""Sword of Triton"" that controls his ship, the Queen Annes Revenge. While Jack is shanghaied aboard Blackbeards ship, Gibbs escapes execution by memorizing and destroying Jacks map showing the Fountains location, forcing Barbossa to take him along.Meanwhile, after a failed mutiny aboard the Queen Annes Revenge, Jack is forced to guide the crew to the Fountain. Blackbeard seeks the Fountains power to circumvent his predestined fatal encounter with a ""one-legged man"", who happened to be Barbossa. Jack must find two silver chalices aboard Juan Ponce de Leóns missing flagship, the Santiago. The Fountains water must simultaneously be drunk by two people from the chalices. Drinking from one chalice containing a mermaids tear will extend life; the second person dies, their remaining years of life transferred to the other drinker. Jack also discovers that the Black Pearl was captured and shrunk before being added to Blackbeards collection of other shrunken ships in bottles.The Queen Annes Revenge heads for Whitecap Bay to find and harvest mermaid tears. After managing to lure in a mermaid named Tamara, she summons other mermaids to attack the crew before Jack causes an explosion that scares them away. A mermaid named Syrena is caught, but Philip Swift, a captive missionary, falls in love with her. Reaching Ponce de Leóns ship on an uncharted island, Angelica and Blackbeard coerce Jack into retrieving both chalices. Jack locates the grounded, decaying vessel, only to find Barbossa there. Both guess that the Spanish have taken the chalices, after they are nowhere to be found on the vessel.Jack and Barbossa team up to sneak into the Spanish camp and steal the chalices. Barbossa reveals he only wants revenge against Blackbeard for attacking the Black Pearl, and his leg being amputated. Jack and Barbossa escape with the chalices. Meanwhile, Syrena, reciprocating Philips love, is tricked into shedding a tear. Blackbeard collects it, leaving her to die of dehydration while Philip is forced to go with them. Jack returns with the chalices and bargains with Blackbeard for Angelicas safety, Jacks confiscated magical compass (which they took from him before sending him to get the chalices), and Gibbs release. In return, Jack vows to give Blackbeard the chalices and lead him to the Fountain; Blackbeard agrees, and Gibbs is set free with the compass.At the Fountain, Blackbeards crew is confronted by Barbossa and his men and they battle while Barbossa and Blackbeard fight. The Spanish suddenly arrive, intending to destroy the Fountain, believing its power an abomination against God. They crush the chalices and throw them in the swamp. When Barbossa stabs Blackbeard with a poisoned sword, Angelica pulls it out but is cut and poisoned. Jack notices Angelica is poisoned and begins frantically searching the swamp for the chalices. Barbossa obtains Blackbeards magic sword and gains control of the Queen Annes Revenge and her crew. Despite resistance from Blackbeards crew, the Spanish successfully pull down a pillar, crushing the Fountain of Youth. The Spanish army leaves once the fountain is in ruins. Philip is mortally wounded, but he returns to free Syrena. She helps Jack retrieve the missing chalices and gives them to him, telling him not to waste her tear. Syrena goes back to the dying Philip. She says she can save him if he asks her to. When he asks for her forgiveness, she kisses him and takes him underwater.With Blackbeard and Angelica both nearing death, Jack retrieves the last remaining drops of water from the destroyed fountain and puts the tear in one of them. Knowing that one of them must be sacrificed, he wants Angelica to drink from the chalice containing the tear. Instead, Blackbeard drinks it, asking his daughter to save him. Angelica agrees and drinks from the second chalice. Jack is upset to lose Angelica, but reveals that he made a mistake about which chalice contained the tear. Neither of the two are happy, and they both believe Jack deliberately tricked them. Angelicas wounds are healed as the Fountain fatally consumes Blackbeards body, killing him.Eventually, Jack and Angelica admit their love for each other, yet he distrusts her intentions (aware that she may try to avenge her father) and strands her on a cay. Now wielding Blackbeards magical sword, Barbossa captains the Queen Annes Revenge and returns to piracy. Jack finds Gibbs, who had used the compass to locate the Revenge. He reclaims the shrunken Black Pearl and the other conquered ships in bottles, carrying them in a gunny sack. The two leave, hoping to revert the Black Pearl to its original size and continue living the pirates life.In a post-credits scene, a voodoo doll of Jack crafted by Blackbeard washes ashore and is found by Angelica, who then smiles.",380000000,"[{""id"": 12, ""name"": ""Adventure""}, {""id"": 28, ""name"": ""Action""}, {""id"": 14, ""name"": ""Fantasy""}]",http://disney.go.com/pirates/index-on-stranger-tides.html#/video/,1865,"[{""id"": 658, ""name"": ""sea""}, {""id"": 1316, ""name"": ""captain""}, {""id"": 1860, ""name"": ""mutiny""}, {""id"": 1938, ""name"": ""sword""}, {""id"": 2569, ""name"": ""prime minister""}, {""id"": 3180, ""name"": ""sailing""}, {""id"": 3625, ""name"": ""silver""}, {""id"": 3799, ""name"": ""ship""}, {""id"": 4235, ""name"": ""duke""}, {""id"": 5938, ""name"": ""mermaid""}, {""id"": 12988, ""name"": ""pirate""}, {""id"": 13065, ""name"": ""soldier""}, {""id"": 14643, ""name"": ""battle""}, {""id"": 157186, ""name"": ""swashbuckler""}, {""id"": 179430, ""name"": ""aftercreditsstinger""}, {""id"": 209714, ""name"": ""3d""}]",en,"Captain Jack Sparrow crosses paths with a woman from his past, and he's not sure if it's love -- or if she's a ruthless con artist who's using him to find the fabled Fountain of Youth.

Four months later, newly arrived Barden University freshman Beca Mitchell has no desire to attend college but is forced to do so by her father, a professor at the university, with whom Beca has a strained relationship. Wishing she could instead pursue a career as a music producer in Los Angeles, Beca spends her time making mash-up mixes of songs and takes up an internship at the school radio station, where she gets to know fellow freshman Jesse Swanson.At the university’s activities fair, Beca is offered to join the Bellas by seniors and current co-leaders Aubrey and Chloe Beale, but she declines. Later, Chloe discovers Beca’s talent for singing and convinces her to audition. Beca reluctantly auditions by performing ""Cups (When Im Gone)"", and joins the Bellas with Cynthia Rose Adams, Stacie Conrad, Lilly Onakuramara, and Fat Amy Hobart. Members Kori and Mary Elise are kicked out for having sex with a Treblemaker the next day. Meanwhile, Jesse is also revealed to have joined the Treblemakers.The Bellas participate in the 2012 ICCA Regionals where, at Aubreys insistence, they perform the same medley that helped the Bellas advance to the Finals the previous year. In spite of their traditional set list, the group manages to place second, sending them to the Semi-Finals. After the competition, the Bellas try to break up a fight between the Treblemakers and the Tonehangers, a group consisting of graduated Treblemakers. Beca and Fat Amy accidentally smash a window with the Treblemakers trophy, which alerts a police officer who then arrests Beca. Outside the police station, Beca meets Jesse but discovers that he has gotten her father involved in the situation, causing a rift between her and her father and causing Beca to berates Jesse.Beca tries to propose that the Bellas be more daring, but Aubrey insists that they will win with their traditional repertoire. At the ICCA Semi-Finals, Beca inserts an impromptu layering of La Rouxs ""Bulletproof"" into Ace of Bases ""The Sign"" in an attempt to reinvigorate the crowd after they seemed to have lost interest. After the performance, Aubrey scolds Beca, and accuses her of both trying to sabotage their chances to advance as well as dating a Treblemaker. Jesse attempts to stand up for Beca but, frustrated at Aubreys obliviousness and Jesses convenience, Beca snaps at them both and quits the Bellas. The Bellas lose their place in the Finals due to their third place ranking behind the Treblemakers and the Footnotes. Meanwhile, Jesse’s roommate Benji Applebaum finds out that the Footnotes leader, Timothy, is a high school student and reports it, causing their disqualification and simultaneously advancing the Bellas to the Finals by default.After spring break, Beca tries to apologize to Jesse for being rude, but he declines, telling that she pushes away everyone who cares about her. During the Bellas rehearsal, Chloe stands up against Aubreys stubbornness, sparking a fight over the groups pitch pipe. However, Beca intervenes, apologizes to the Bellas for changing the set without Aubreys permission during the Semi-Finals, and asks to be given a second chance. After all of the Bellas have a heart-to-heart conversation, Beca rejoins the group, and Aubrey relinquishes her half of the leadership to Beca. Meanwhile, Treblemakers leader Bumper Allen leaves the group after being offered a job as a back-up singer for John Mayer. With Bumper gone, Jesse persuades the Trebles to let Benji join the group in Bumpers place, a position Benji failed to earn during the auditions earlier.At the Finals, the Bellas perform a modern piece arranged by Beca, which includes Simple Minds ""Dont You (Forget About Me)"", a song featured in The Breakfast Club, one of Jesses favorite movies.

She explains further that Ozaki actually completed his third ordeal, despite what was widely believed. He did not die attempting the ordeal, but was actually killed by a whaling ship crashing into his boat while he was trying to save humpback whales. On his boat, a young boy, Bodhi, decided not to tell the truth of his story but to finish what Ozaki started.Next they travel to a gold mine where Bodhi detonates explosives Grommet and Roach planted. After blowing his cover, Utah chases Bodhi, managing to trip his bike. Bodhi escapes because Utah cannot stand up after the crash. The FBI freezes Bodhis sponsors assets; Bodhi plans to rob a nearby Italian bank on a mountain top. Utah and the police intercept the group, resulting in a crossfire that kills Roach. As the group flees, Utah chases and shoots one of them to death, who is revealed to be Samsara and not Bodhi.Utah finds the location of the next ordeal: solo rock climbing with no safety beside Angel Falls in Venezuela. He finds Bodhi and Grommet and chases them on the climb, but Grommet falters, falling to his death. Utah catches up to Bodhi, but he falls backward down the waterfall, completing what would have been the last ordeal; Bodhi has to redo the fourth ordeal because he bailed out on the wave when he chose to save Johnny. Seventeen months later, Utah finds him in the Pacific facing another giant wave. As Utah tries to get Bodhi to come back with him and pay for his crimes, he eventually lets Bodhi attempt to surf it, both knowing that he will not come back. The wave engulfs Bodhi, and Utah continues his career in the FBI and begins going through his own eight ordeals.",105000000,"[{""id"": 28, ""name"": ""Action""}, {""id"": 80, ""name"": ""Crime""}, {""id"": 53, ""name"": ""Thriller""}]",https://www.facebook.com/PointBreakMovie,257088,"[{""id"": 1568, ""name"": ""undercover""}, {""id"": 4654, ""name"": ""undercover agent""}, {""id"": 12189, ""name"": ""extreme sports""}, {""id"": 18525, ""name"": ""fbi agent""}, {""id"": 209714, ""name"": ""3d""}]",en,"A young undercover FBI agent infiltrates a gang of thieves who share a common interest in extreme sports.

It contains numerous flash-forward and flashback cuts, indicated with an overlaid digital clock showing the time advancing rapidly forward/backward to the next scene. In chronological order:Wilee (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is a disenchanted Columbia Law School graduate who has put off taking the bar exam because he could not bear to enter the humdrum life of the legal profession. He finds meaning and purpose in being employed as a thrill-seeking New York City bicycle messenger despite arguments with his girlfriend and fellow bike messenger, Vanessa (Dania Ramirez), who insists that he should make something of himself.Vanessas roommate, Nima (Jamie Chung), has asked Vanessa to move out for a personal reason she doesnt disclose. Vanessa is in the process of packing her few belongings. Nima delivers $50,000 that she has saved for two years to Mr. Leung (Henry O), a Chinese hawaladar, in exchange for a ticket that she must deliver to Sister Chen, buying a place for Nimas son and mother in one of Sister Chens ships on which gangs smuggle people from China to the United States.Mr. Lin, a local loan shark, has learned of the ticket and that whoever returns it to Mr. Leung can collect Nimas money. He approaches Robert ""Bobby"" Monday (Michael Shannon), a gambling-addicted NYPD detective who owes him money, offering to clear Mondays debt if Monday gets him the ticket. Monday begins searching for Nima, who decides to hire Wilee to deliver the envelope with the ticket to Sister Chen by 7 pm after Nima is told by Leung that anyone who knew she was visiting him is a loose end which could cause her to be in possible danger if she tries to deliver the ticket herself. Wilee and Nima conduct their transaction at the college where Nima is a student. After Wilee leaves, Nima is confronted by Monday, who sees the courier receipt Wilee gave her. He is able to steal the receipt from Nima. After Monday leaves, Vanessa finds Nima, and learns the contents of the envelope.Monday catches up with Wilee before he leaves the college campus, stating that he is a college official, that Nima had no authority to handle the contents of the envelope on the colleges behalf, and that he would like the envelope back, with the receipt Wilee gave to Nima in his hands. Wilee refuses. He is able to escape, with Monday in pursuit. Wilee heads to the police station to report Monday, only to find out hes a police detective. Wilee hides in the bathroom, where he opens the envelope and finds the ticket.After he escapes the station, Wilee angrily tells his dispatcher, Raj (Aasif Mandvi), that he is returning the package so that someone else can drop it off. Returning to Nimas college, Wilee leaves the envelope, which is picked up by his rival, Manny (Wolé Parks). Before Manny picks it up, however, Monday calls the dispatch to redirect the delivery to a different address.As he is about to leave the college after returning the envelope, Wilee runs into Nima. He confronts her about the ticket, and she reveals the truth. Guilt-ridden, Wilee tries to catch up to Manny, who refuses to give Wilee his drop. They race each other and in the process, are chased by a bike cop who had earlier tried to arrest Wilee. As they approach Mondays location, the bike cop tackles Manny off his bike and arrests him. Vanessa, who learns of Mondays trickery and races over to warn Manny, appears, grabs Mannys bag and gives it to Wilee.As they are about to escape, Wilee is hit by an oncoming taxi. He falls to the ground fracturing some ribs in the process. He is put in an ambulance with Monday, while his damaged bike is taken to an impound lot, with the envelope hidden in the handlebars. Monday tortures Wilee by pressing on his injured ribs, and Wilee offers to give Monday the envelope in exchange for his bike.Wilee tells Monday that the envelope is in Mannys bag, and Monday leaves to search it, while Wilee meets with Vanessa in the impound lot. She gives him the envelope, which she had retrieved, and he escapes on a stolen bike. Monday, realizing Wilee has tricked him, pursues Wilee to Sister Chens place. Meanwhile, Nima calls Mr. Leung for help. He deploys his enforcer, the Sudoku Man, to help her.As Wilee reaches Chinatown, he is confronted by Monday, who is threatening to kill him. However, Vanessa arrives with a flash mob of messengers, dispatched by Raj, who delay Monday by hitting him numerous times, giving Wilee time to deliver the ticket to Sister Chen just before the stroke of 7 pm. She calls the captain of her ship and tells him to allow Nimas family aboard. Outside, Monday is confronted by the Sudoku Man, who shoots Monday in the back of his head with a silenced pistol. Dying and feeling faint, Monday tries to get in his car saying that he just wants to think for a second, but dies before he can do so. Nimas mother calls her and confirms that she and Nimas son have gotten on the ship.

453,454,Pride and Prejudice and Zombies,2016,/wiki/Pride_and_Prejudice_and_Zombies,"In early-19th-century England, a zombie plague has spread across the country. Miss Elizabeth Bennet, a young woman, lives with her parents and four sisters. Mr. Bennet drills his daughters in martial arts and weapons training, moulding them into capable zombie-fighters. Meanwhile, Mrs. Bennet endeavours to obtain for them wealthy and high-status husbands. Seeing an opportunity to achieve her goal, Mrs. Bennet sends her daughters to a local ball where a wealthy bachelor, Charles Bingley, is expected to make an appearance.  At the ball, Mr. Bingley and the eldest Bennet daughter, Jane, make a connection in the midst of a chaotic zombie attack. During this time, Elizabeth meets Fitzwilliam Darcy, Mr. Bingleys closest friend and a noted zombie killer.As time passes, Mr. Bingley and Jane become more acquainted.  However, this companionship leaves the Bennet girls confused when Mr. Bingley and company suddenly abandon Netherfield Park. When the local militia arrives in town to exhume and destroy dead bodies, Elizabeth becomes friendly with one of the soldiers, George Wickham, who claims that Darcy cheated him of an inheritance. Elizabeths dislike for Darcy intensifies when she learns that he plotted to separate Bingley from her sister, Jane. Elizabeth vows to avenge the separation by killing Darcy, and she is afforded that opportunity when he appears unannounced at a cottage where she is visiting her newlywed friend Charlotte. Darcy surprises her by proposing marriage, and they break into a verbal and physical fight in which Darcy is wounded. He escapes and writes a long letter to Elizabeth explaining his actions: that he separated Jane and Bingley out of fear that Jane had contracted the ""mysterious plague"".  In regards to the allegedly wronged soldier Wickham, Darcy explains that Wickham attempted to elope with Darcys younger sister to take her considerable fortune – the ""inheritance"" that Wickham had claimed. Elizabeth realizes that she had judged Darcy too harshly and is humbled. Darcy realizes that his demeanour encourages people to believe the rumours about him and resolves to act more appropriately.Elizabeth embarks on a trip around the country with her aunt and uncle, fighting zombies along the way. At Pemberley she encounters Darcy, who repels a horde of zombies. Darcys changed attitude and manners impress Elizabeth and lead her to consider reconciling their relationship.

454,455,Priest,2011,/wiki/Priest_(2011_film),"A centuries long war between humans and vampires has devastated the planets surface and led to a theocracy under an organization called The Church.  They constructed giant walled cities to protect mankind and developed a group of elite warriors, the Priests, to turn the tide against the vampires. The majority of the vampires were killed, while the remainder were placed in reservations. With the war over, the Clergy disbanded the Priests. Outside the walled cities, some humans seek out a living, free from the totalitarian control of the Church.Priest (Paul Bettany) is approached by Hicks (Cam Gigandet), the sheriff of Augustine, a free town. Priest learns that his brother and his wife, Shannon - Priests girlfriend before he entered the priesthood - were mortally wounded in a vampire attack, and Priests niece, Lucy (Lily Collins), was kidnapped. Hicks asks for Priests help in rescuing Lucy. Priest asks the Clergy to reinstate his authority, but Church leader Monsignor Orelas (Christopher Plummer) does not believe the vampire story and refuses, not wanting to discourage the idea that the Church completely defeated the vampires for fear of compromising their authority over the city. Priest defiantly leaves the city and Orelas sends three Priests and a Priestess to bring him back.Priest and Hicks arrive at Nightshade Reservation where humans called Familiars, people infected with a pathogen that makes them subservient to the vampires, live alongside a number of the surviving vampires. After a fierce battle, the pair discovers that most of the vampires have taken shelter in Sola Mira, a vampire hive where Priest lost several of his comrades during a major battle. Priestess (Maggie Q) joins them at Sola Mira, revealing a bond with Priest. The trio destroys a Hive Guardian vampire, then discover that the vampires have bred a new army and dug a tunnel out of the mountain towards a town called Jericho. The other three Priests have arrived at Jericho just as night falls and an armored train arrives, unleashing hundreds of vampires upon the population. The vampires are led by a powerful and mysterious human wearing a black hat. When the three Priests reject Black Hats offer to join him, he kills them all.The next morning, Priest, Priestess and Hicks arrive in Jericho and discover the town empty and the three dead Priests crucified. Priest and Priestess share an intimate moment where she makes her move, hoping that now that Shannon has died, he would no longer feel bound to her. Priest, who is clearly not over Shannon, gently refuses. Priest realizes that the vampires have been using the trains to travel by day and attack the free towns by night, with the walled cities at the end of the train line. Hicks believes an attack on the cities would be unwise because of the sun, but Priest reveals that factories, producing massive clouds of smoke and ash, have permanently deprived the city of sunlight, so the vampire attack would be a slaughter.Hicks threatens Priest, claiming he will shoot him unless he promises to let Lucy live whether she has been infected or not. (Priest had earlier revealed to Hicks, who is in love with Lucy, that if they discovered Lucy had been infected as a Familiar, he would kill her.)  Hicks does not understand why Priest, who is basically a stranger to Lucy, cares so much about her. Priestess reveals that Lucy is actually Priests daughter, and that his brother, Owen, stepped in as a husband and a father when Priest was taken by The Church.While Priestess rushes ahead to plant a bomb on the railroad tracks, Priest and Hicks board the train to rescue Lucy. Battling vampires and Familiars, the two are finally overpowered by Black Hat just as they find Lucy. Black Hat is revealed as one of the Priests who was defeated in the final attack on Sola Mira and a close friend of Priest. After being captured, the vampire Queen gave him her blood, turning him into the first Vampire-Human hybrid who can survive the sun. As Priest fights Black Hat, Lucy discovers the truth about her parentage. Priestess battles several Familiars, finally placing the explosives on her motor bike and crashing it into the train engine. The explosion and subsequent derailment kills the vampires and engulfs Black Hat in fire, while Hicks, Priest, Priestess, and Lucy are able to escape.Priest returns to the city and confronts Monsignor Orelas during Mass, telling him of the burnt train containing the vampires bodies, but not the Queens. He proves this by throwing a vampire head onto the floor and shocking everyone in the room. Orelas still refuses to believe him, declaring that the war is over, while Priest says that it is just beginning. Outside the city Priest meets Priestess, and she reveals that the other Priests have been notified and will meet them at a rendezvous point.

455,456,Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time,2010,/wiki/Prince_of_Persia:_The_Sands_of_Time_(film),"SettingThe film seems to be set in ancient Persia, as the film starts with a  map portending to show the expanse of the Persian Empire 2500 years ago. The film set design seems to be based on Islamic Persia. Islamic architecture with intricate use of geometric shapes and domes are shown. The cities in the film all appear to have minarets. The Allied Kingdom of Alamut, shown in the movie wasnt established until 9th century(after Islamic Conquest of Persia). The Alamut castle was built by the Justanid ruler, Wahsudan b. Marzuban, a follower of zaydi Islam, around 865 AD. It was seized by Hassan-i Sabbah, who was the leader of the Nizārī Ismā‘īlītes and the founder of the secret order known as Assassins.StorylineDastan, a street urchin in Persia, is adopted by King Sharaman after showing courage. Fifteen years later, the kings brother Nizam relays evidence to the princes—Dastan, along with the kings biological sons Tus and Garsiv—that the holy city of Alamut is forging weapons for Persias enemies. Tus directs the Persian army to capture Alamut. Dastan and his friends breach the city and open a gate for the siege. During the attack, Dastan defeats a royal guard and takes from him a sacred dagger.Alamut falls to the Persians, but Princess Tamina denies that the city has any weapon forges. Tus asks her to marry him to unite the two nations, and she only accepts after seeing the dagger in Dastans possession. At their celebratory banquet, Tus has Dastan give their father an embroidered robe. The robe is poisoned, fatally burning King Sharaman. Garsiv accuses Dastan of the kings murder, but Dastan escapes with Tamina. Tus is appointed king and sets a bounty on Dastans head.While in hiding, Tamina attempts to kill Dastan and steal the dagger, and in the struggle Dastan discovers the dagger enables the wielder to travel back in time. Dastan concludes that Tus invaded Alamut for the dagger, and decides to confront his brother at the funeral of the king in Avrat. On the way, the two are captured by merchant-bandits led by Sheik Amar who seeks the reward money, but they manage to escape. After arriving in Avrat, Dastan tries to convince his uncle Nizam of his innocence. Seeing burns on Nizams hands, Dastan realizes that Nizam orchestrated the kings murder. Furthermore, Nizam has set up an ambush for Dastan along the Persian streets, but after a conflict with Garsiv, Dastan escapes. Nizam sends a group of covert warriors, the Hassansins, to kill Dastan and find the dagger.During a sandstorm, Tamina tells Dastan that long ago, the gods unleashed a great sandstorm to destroy humanity but were moved by a young girls offer to sacrifice herself in humanitys place and trapped the Sands of Time in a large sandglass. Tamina is the latest guardian of the dagger, given to the young girl by the gods, which can pierce the sandglass and potentially destroy the world but also enable the daggers wielder to travel further back in time than the one minutes worth of sand the dagger holds. Dastan realizes that Nizam intends to travel back to his childhood, prevent himself from saving Sharaman from a lion attack, and grow up to be king of Persia in Sharamans place. Amar captures the two again, but Dastan saves Amars men from a Hassansin attack using the dagger. Amar is convinced to escort them to a sanctuary near Hindu Kush, where Tamina will seal the dagger within the stone it first came from. At the sanctuary, they are found by Garsiv, whom Dastan convinces of his innocence, but the Hassansins ambush them, killing Garsiv and stealing the dagger.Dastans group travels back to Alamut to retrieve the dagger from Nizam and warn Tus of Nizam. Amars right-hand man Seso dies retrieving the dagger for Dastan, who demonstrates the daggers powers to Tus to convince him of the truth. Afterwards, Nizam interrupts them, kills Tus, and takes the dagger back. Tamina saves Dastan from being killed and the two head for the secret underground tunnels beneath the city that lead to the sandglass. When they reach Nizam, he stabs the sandglass and throws them both off a cliff. Tamina sacrifices herself, releasing Dastans hand and falling to her death to allow him to fight Nizam.When Dastan removes the dagger from the sandglass, time rewinds to the moment he found the dagger. Dastan finds Tus and Garsiv and exposes Nizams treachery. Nizam attempts to kill Dastan, but is subdued and killed by Tus. Tus apologizes to Tamina for the siege and proposes to strengthen the two nations bond by marrying her to Dastan. Dastan returns the dagger to Tamina as an engagement gift and tells her he looks forward to their future together.",150000000,"[{""id"": 12, ""name"": ""Adventure""}, {""id"": 14, ""name"": ""Fantasy""}, {""id"": 28, ""name"": ""Action""}, {""id"": 10749, ""name"": ""Romance""}]",http://disney.go.com/disneypictures/princeofpersia,9543,"[{""id"": 1241, ""name"": ""persia""}, {""id"": 1965, ""name"": ""sandstorm""}, {""id"": 12653, ""name"": ""brother against brother""}, {""id"": 12654, ""name"": ""armageddon""}, {""id"": 12655, ""name"": ""regent""}, {""id"": 41645, ""name"": ""based on video game""}]",en,"A rogue prince reluctantly joins forces with a mysterious princess and together, they race against dark forces to safeguard an ancient dagger capable of releasing the Sands of Time – gift from the gods that can reverse time and allow its possessor to rule the world.",62.169881,"[{""name"": ""Walt Disney Pictures"", ""id"": 2}, {""name"": ""Jerry Bruckheimer Films"", ""id"": 130}]","[{""iso_3166_1"": ""US"", ""name"": ""United States of America""}]",5/19/2010,335154643,116,"[{""iso_639_1"": ""en"", ""name"": ""English""}]",Released,Defy the Future,Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time,6.2,2317,0.153409272,0.5,0.301131517,0.5,-0.198868483,0.198868483,-0.346590728,0.248109231,2.234364287
456,457,Prisoners,2013,/wiki/Prisoners_(2013_film),"In suburban Pennsylvania, Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman), his wife Grace, their teenage son Ralph and young daughter Anna attend a Thanksgiving dinner at the home of their friends, Franklin Birch (Terrence Howard) and his wife Nancy (Viola Davis), their teenage daughter Eliza and young daughter Joy. The four children go for a walk in the neighborhood and approach an RV that is parked outside a house nearby. There is music playing, which suggests there is somebody inside. After dinner, Anna and Joy go missing.Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) is informed and starts a search. He locates the RV, which is found parked at a gas station. As police surround the vehicle, the driver, Alex Jones, starts the vehicle and crashes into a nearby tree. He is subsequently arrested and taken away. Alex has the IQ of a 10-year-old, and appears confused when being questioned at the police station. His vehicle is searched by forensics but nothing is found relating to the girls. Pursuing other leads, Loki discovers a corpse in the basement of Patrick Dunn, a priest. Dunn admits that he killed the man because the man confessed he was ""waging a war against God"" and had killed 16 children and said that he would kill more.As the search continues, Dover is informed that Alex has been released and attacks him outside the police station. Alex whispers to him, ""They didnt cry until I left them."" Since Loki wont re-arrest Alex, and Dover hears Alex singing the same ditty as Anna, Dover abducts him, locks him up in his late fathers abandoned home and tortures him—with the help of a reluctant Franklin—to force him to talk. First he beats him, but Alex says nothing. Dover ties him up in the shower and uses plywood to enclose him in the dark. He adjusts the water so the shower is either scorching hot or freezing to further torture him.At a candlelight vigil for the girls, Loki sees a suspicious hooded man, who flees when Loki approaches him. Later on, the man breaks into both families houses but leaves without doing anything. Loki follows Dover to where Alex is being held prisoner but doesnt find him, as Dover fabricates a story about stopping over in the building so hes able to drink to ease his suffering without his wife knowing.  A store clerk recognizes the hooded man from a composite drawing and reports him to Loki after seeing him buying childrens clothing. The suspect, Bob Taylor, is later arrested at his home, where the walls are covered in drawings of mazes. Loki then finds crates filled with maze books, live snakes, and bloodied childrens clothing, including items belonging to the missing girls. They discover Taylor had himself been abducted as a child. At the police station, Taylor confesses to the abduction but during a physical altercation with Loki and two other officers, he snatches a gun and kills himself without revealing any more information. The police conclude that Taylor was a fantasist and had no involvement with the disappearances; he stole the clothes from the girls homes and bloodied them with pigs blood to recreate abductions.Dover continues to torture Alex, who incoherently talks about escaping from a maze. Dover visits Alexs aunt, Holly, who tells him that Alex is the way he is because he had an accident with snakes her husband kept as pets when he was younger. She also says that she and her husband were religious until their young son died of cancer. Back at the police station, Loki becomes frustrated with getting nowhere with the case until he matches a maze Taylor drew while in custody to the maze necklace worn by the man Patrick Dunn killed in his basement.Suddenly, Joy Birch is found drugged but alive. Dover visits her in the hospital to ask for information. Her memories are confused but she mumbles, ""You were there,"" to Dover. He then realizes that Joy may have heard his voice at the Joneses house when he visited Holly, and runs from the police. Loki searches for Dover at the apartment building and discovers Alex. Dover then goes back to the Joneses house to get information from Holly, but she pulls a gun on him. She explains that, before her husband left her, they abducted many children as part of their ""war on God"" to avenge their sons death. Alex was the first child they abducted, followed by Taylor. Alex just took the girls for a ride, and Holly decided to abduct them. Holly shoots Dover in the leg and imprisons him in a concealed pit in her yard, where he finds the emergency whistle belonging to his daughter.Loki goes to the Joneses house to tell her that her nephew has been found. He finds a photograph of Hollys husband wearing the same maze necklace found on the body in the priests basement, making him her missing husband. Loki finds Holly drugging Anna, and they exchange gunfire. Loki is wounded, and Holly is killed. Loki then rushes Anna to the hospital where she reunites with her mother. Alex is reunited with his parents after surviving the torture. A day later, Loki returns to the Joneses house where the authorities have begun excavating the property. As the forensic investigators depart for the night, Loki hears Dovers labored blowing on the whistle from the pit.",46000000,"[{""id"": 18, ""name"": ""Drama""}, {""id"": 53, ""name"": ""Thriller""}, {""id"": 80, ""name"": ""Crime""}]",http://prisonersmovie.warnerbros.com/,146233,"[{""id"": 904, ""name"": ""pennsylvania""}, {""id"": 1930, ""name"": ""kidnapping""}, {""id"": 2158, ""name"": ""maze""}, {""id"": 7002, ""name"": ""vigilante""}, {""id"": 11004, ""name"": ""rural setting""}, {""id"": 166625, ""name"": ""candlelight vigil""}]",en,"When Keller Dover's daughter and her friend go missing, he takes matters into his own hands as the police pursue multiple leads and the pressure mounts.

457,458,Project Almanac,2015,/wiki/Project_Almanac,"In 2014, 17-year-old high school senior and aspiring inventor David Raskin (Jonny Weston) is admitted into MIT, but is unable to afford its tuition fees. Upon learning his mother, Kathy Raskin (Amy Landecker), is planning to sell the house to help pay for his college, David enlists his sister Christina (Virginia Gardner) and his friends Adam Le (Allen Evangelista) and Quinn Goldberg (Sam Lerner) to sift through the belongings of his father Ben Raskin (Gary Weeks), an inventor who died in a car crash on Davids seventh birthday, in the hope of finding something that David can use to get a scholarship instead. David finds an old camera with a video recording of his seventh birthday party, in which he briefly spots his 17-year-old self in a reflection. Noticing how he appears to be reaching for a basement light switch in the reflection, David and his friends go to the basement, which was forbidden by his father. Underneath a trapdoor activated by the basement switch, the group find the blueprints of a temporal relocation device that Ben was developing named ""Project Almanac"", and use the available resources to build a functional time machine. David, Christina, Adam, and Quinn later use the battery from the car of Davids longtime crush, Jessie Pierce (Sofia Black-DElia), to charge up the machine, and successfully send a toy car back in time, but blow out the power for the entire neighborhood. They end up being caught by Jessie and recruit her to their experiment.David, Jessie, Christina, Adam, and Quinn eventually travel back in time to the day before and break into Quinns house, where he draws a smiley face on the back of the neck of his sleeping past self (which simultaneously appears on the back of the visiting Quinns neck). However, he awakens and seeing his future self causes a feedback loop that nearly erases them both from the timeline. The five agree to use the machine for personal gain on the condition that they always use it together. Adam uses it to win the lottery, Christina gets back at her bullies, Quinn aces a chemistry test to secure his academic future, and the group eventually decides to travel back to Lollapalooza three months before. David hesitates to declare his feelings for Jessie during a particularly open and obvious moment in their conversation, and their relationship becomes awkward. David decides to travel back to Lollapalooza alone to change that, leading to a future in which they are a couple. When he returns, he finds that the blackout caused by them sending the toy car back resulted in their schools star basketball player getting hit by a car and breaking his leg; the team doesnt make it to the championships, and those that would have attended go elsewhere, including the players father, a pilot who ends up crashing a commercial airliner, along with multiple other catastrophes around the world. David goes back alone once again and prevents the accident that would lead to the players injury, and averts the plane crash. He returns to the future to learn that instead Adam is in critical condition in the hospital after being run over.David continues to travel back in time to rectify the poor outcomes, but eventually is caught by Jessie during one of his trips, accidentally sending her back with him. Jessie confronts David, who is forced to admit to using the time machine to win her affection. As Jessie lambastes David for his deception, her past self runs up, causing another feedback loop, and Jessie is erased from the timeline. David decides to go back to prevent the machine from being created, but the machine is out of hydrogen. As David returns to the present, he is confronted by the police, who suspect him of being connected to Jessies disappearance. Narrowly evading the manhunt after him, David is able to get to his school and obtains a hydrogen canister. He manages to activate the machine just as the police break into the supply room, and sends himself back to the day of his seventh birthday.In the basement, David confronts his father Ben, who recognizes him and realizes that this means he will eventually complete the machine. David convinces Ben of the machines danger and tells him that he should say goodbye to his son. Meanwhile, David destroys the blueprints and a vital component, causing him to be erased from the timeline. However, the camera he and his friends have been using all along is left behind and records the whole thing. Back in the future, David and Christina are once again going through their fathers belongings, when they find their fathers camera (as they did originally in the beginning) as well as the alternate Davids camera, which still contains all the footage of David and the group from the original timeline, beginning with the original recording of him and Christina finding only one camera in the attic.  Later, at school, David approaches Jessie for the first time once again and confides in her that they are about to ""change the world"", implying they are going to make a second attempt at the time machine.In a alternate ending, roles are reversed as Jessie approaches David for her bag, showing initial interest in him. He sees her keys and realizes the video is true with Jessie asking if they are “going somewhere”.",12000000,"[{""id"": 878, ""name"": ""Science Fiction""}, {""id"": 53, ""name"": ""Thriller""}]",http://www.projectalmanac.com/,227719,"[{""id"": 4379, ""name"": ""time travel""}, {""id"": 5455, ""name"": ""time machine""}, {""id"": 13130, ""name"": ""teenager""}, {""id"": 163053, ""name"": ""found footage""}]",en,"A group of teens discover secret plans of a time machine, and construct one.

458,459,Prom,2011,/wiki/Prom_(film),"Its time for the annual prom. Nova Prescott (Aimee Teegarden) is on the prom committee with her friends Mei Kwan (Yin Chang), Ali Gomez (Janelle Ortiz), Brandon Roberts (Jonathan Keltz) and Rolo Banus (Joe Adler). They made all of the decorations and are finally prepared. Nova hopes Brandon, whom she has a crush on, will ask her to go to the prom. The prom is both something to look forward to and a source of worry. Lloyd Taylor (Nicholas Braun) complains to his stepsister Tess Torres (Raini Rodriguez) that he has no date, but Tess recommends to ask anybody, it does not matter who. Mei discovered by now that she has been accepted at a different university than her boyfriend Justin Wexler (Jared Kusnitz), and worries about telling him as prom approaches. Lucas Arnaz (Nolan Sotillo) has been in love with his lab partner Simone (Danielle Campbell), and turns to his friend Corey Doyle (Cameron Monaghan) to help him ask her to the prom. The only one who does not care about the prom is Jesse Richter (Thomas McDonell). He plays truant, rides his motorcycle across the schoolyard, and behaves as if nothing matters. Principal Dunnan (Jere Burns) tries to talk to him but does not get through to him.Meanwhile, Jordan Lundley (Kylie Bunbury) finds an earring in the car of her boyfriend, Tyler Barso (DeVaughn Nixon) but he assures her that hes not cheating. He shows how much he cares for her by taking her on a romantic date inside of the shed with the prom decorations, and asking her to the prom. Unfortunately, they forget to blow out a candle after their departure and it sets the shed and the decorations ablaze. With only three weeks left, Nova is forced to make all new props, but her friends are too busy with other things and can not help her. The principal gives Jesse a choice, either he helps Nova with the decorations, or he cant graduate. Jesse accepts reluctantly, as does Nova. They realize that they need each other. While Brandon deeply disappoints Nova by not asking her to the prom, she and Jesse grow closer, despite the fact that Jesse finds the idea of prom ridiculous. When Nova discovers that the prom theme of the neighboring school is the same as theirs, Jesse decides to sneak into their school and see how their decorations compare. Unfortunately while trespassing, the security guard notices them and the police catch them after they escape.  The police call Novas parents and when Novas father arrives he gets extremely mad at Jesse. Meanwhile, Lloyd still cannot find a date. He gets frustrated and desperate. Lucas asks Simone to a barbecue of his friend Tyler. Tyler tries to talk and flirt with her and she rejects him, because he is dating Jordan. Simone tells Lucas she wouldnt have gone if she had known it was Tylers party. It seems that Tyler and Simone have a past. Meanwhile, the stress in Mei and Justins relationship reaches the breaking point, and Mei cancels on Justin for fear of telling him about her acceptance. At school, Lucas blows off Corey to spend more time with Simone, and asks her to study for the upcoming test with him, to which she agrees. However, as she is about to go to library, Simone is stopped by Tyler, who convinces her to talk with him. He tells her about his feelings for her. Jordan sees the two talking and immediately grasps the situation. After school, Nova apologizes to Jesse for her dads behavior. Later, she brings him along as she goes dress shopping, for a second opinion. Back at school, Simone apologizes to Lucas for having ditched him. She has a surprise, tickets to a concert, where Stick Hippo (his and Coreys favorite band) is opening. Lucas wants to take Simone instead of Corey, much to Coreys dismay. Jordan dumps Tyler for his unfaithfulness, and decides to go to prom alone. This prompts him to ask Simone to prom, which is the same night as the concert, and she agrees. Simone tells Lucas that she is sorry, but she cannot go to the concert.Mei apologizes to Justin for her behaviour and tells him the truth, but instead of feeling hurt that she is going to a different college, he tells her he is proud of her. They agree that they should still go to prom together. As Lloyd gets rejected by another girl, he spots Lucas sitting outside the school, looking dejected. He learns his situation, and tells Lucas his own mistake with girls and high school. Lloyd tells Lucas that if he really loves Simone, then he should tell her. Two nights before the prom, Nova, Ali, and Mei are in Novas room, talking. Nova confesses to them that she has feelings for Jesse, which her dad unfortunately overhears. The next day, Novas father tells Jesse he cannot ask Nova to prom, because he is ""bringing her down"". That afternoon, Jesse is unusually hostile towards Nova and deserts her. On prom night, Lucas climbs a tree to reach Simones window. He tells her how he feels and begs her not to go to prom, but she goes anyway. Disappointed, Lucas realizes what a bad friend he has been to Corey, and offers him the other concert ticket. The two head off to see their favorite band happily. At her house, Nova is heartbroken, and refuses to pose for the camera in her prom dress. Her father, worried, explains that he was the one who told Jesse not to ask her to prom. Angered, Nova storms out of the house. Meanwhile, at Lloyds house, it is revealed that he is taking his sister to prom. At Jesses house, his mother has a talk with him, and he realizes that he should still take Nova to prom. At the school, Tyler leads Simone into the building, and almost immediately abandons her. Simone finds out from a couple of girls that it was actually Jordan who dumped Tyler, and Tyler had gone to her with no other option. As Tyler and Jordan are pronounced prom king and queen, Jordan refuses to participate in the king-and-queen dance. When Tyler asks Simone to dance, she refuses and leaves. She goes to the concert parking lot, where she waits for Lucas, and they share a dance. Nova is having an awful time at prom, and when Ali tells her the fountain centerpiece is broken, she cannot take it any more. As she is about to leave, she hears the fountain start again, and knows the only person who could have fixed it was Jesse. He walks up to her and asks her to prom.

459,460,Prometheus,2012,/wiki/Prometheus_(2012_film),"As a spacecraft departs a planet, a humanoid alien drinks an iridescent liquid, causing its body to dissolve. As its remains cascade into a waterfall, the aliens DNA falls apart and recombines.In 2089, archaeologists Elizabeth Shaw and Charlie Holloway discover a star map in Scotland that matches others from several unconnected ancient cultures. They interpret this as an invitation from humanitys forerunners, the ""Engineers."" Peter Weyland, the elderly CEO of Weyland Corporation, funds an expedition, aboard the scientific vessel Prometheus, to follow the map to the distant moon LV-223. The ships crew travels in stasis while the android David monitors their voyage. Arriving in December 2093, mission-director Meredith Vickers informs them of their mission to find the Engineers and not to make contact without her permission.The Prometheus lands on the barren, mountainous surface near a large, artificial structure, which a team explores. Inside, they find stone cylinders, a monolithic statue of a humanoid head, and the decapitated corpse of a large alien, thought to be an Engineer; Shaw recovers its head. The crew finds other bodies, leading them to surmise the species is extinct. Crew members Millburn and Fifield grow uncomfortable with the discoveries and attempt to return to Prometheus, but become stranded in the structure when they get lost. The expedition is cut short when a storm forces the crew to return to the ship. David secretly takes a cylinder from the structure, while the remaining cylinders begin leaking a dark liquid. In the ships lab, the Engineers DNA is found to match that of humans. David investigates the cylinder and the liquid inside. He intentionally taints a drink with the liquid and gives it to the unsuspecting Holloway, who had stated he would do anything for answers. Shortly after, Shaw and Holloway have sex.Inside the structure, a snake-like creature kills Millburn and sprays a corrosive fluid that melts Fifields helmet. Fifield falls face-first into a puddle of dark liquid. When the crew returns, they find Millburns corpse. David separately discovers a control room containing a surviving Engineer in stasis, and a large 3D holographic star map highlighting Earth. Meanwhile, Holloway sickens rapidly. He is rushed back to Prometheus, but Vickers refuses to let him aboard, and at his urging, burns him to death with a flamethrower. Later, a medical scan reveals that Shaw, despite being sterile, is pregnant. Fearing the worst, she uses an automated surgery table to extract a squid-like creature from her abdomen. Shaw then discovers that Weyland has been in stasis aboard Prometheus. He explains that he wants to ask the Engineers how to prevent his death from old age. As Weyland prepares to leave for the structure, Vickers addresses him as ""Father"".A monstrous, mutated Fifield returns to the Prometheus and kills several crew members before he is killed. The Prometheus captain, Janek, speculates that the structure was an Engineer military base that lost control of a virulent biological weapon, the dark liquid. He also determines that the structure houses a spacecraft. Weyland and a team return to the structure, accompanied by Shaw. David wakes the Engineer from stasis and speaks to him in an attempt to explain what Weyland wants. The Engineer responds by decapitating David and killing Weyland and his team, before reactivating the spacecraft. Shaw flees and warns Janek that the Engineer is planning to release the liquid on Earth, convincing him to stop the spacecraft. Janek and the remaining crew sacrifice themselves by ramming the Prometheus into the alien craft, ejecting the lifeboat in the process, while Vickers flees in an escape pod. The Engineers disabled spacecraft crashes onto the ground, killing Vickers. Shaw goes to the lifeboat and finds her alien offspring is alive and has grown to gigantic size. Davids still-active head warns Shaw that the Engineer is pursuing her. The Engineer forces open the lifeboats airlock and attacks Shaw, who releases her alien offspring onto the Engineer; it thrusts an ovipositor down the Engineers throat, subduing him. Shaw recovers Davids remains, and with his help, launches another Engineer spacecraft. She intends to reach the Engineers homeworld in an attempt to understand why they wanted to destroy humanity.In the lifeboat, an alien creature bursts out of the Engineers chest.",130000000,"[{""id"": 878, ""name"": ""Science Fiction""}, {""id"": 12, ""name"": ""Adventure""}, {""id"": 9648, ""name"": ""Mystery""}]",http://www.projectprometheus.com/,70981,"[{""id"": 803, ""name"": ""android""}, {""id"": 4565, ""name"": ""dystopia""}, {""id"": 9951, ""name"": ""alien""}, {""id"": 15285, ""name"": ""spin off""}, {""id"": 163402, ""name"": ""creation""}, {""id"": 168835, ""name"": ""emergency surgery""}, {""id"": 179430, ""name"": ""aftercreditsstinger""}, {""id"": 181895, ""name"": ""stasis""}, {""id"": 181900, ""name"": ""archeological dig""}, {""id"": 181905, ""name"": ""god complex""}, {""id"": 181908, ""name"": ""cave drawing""}, {""id"": 233300, ""name"": ""genetic mutation""}, {""id"": 236312, ""name"": ""origins of life""}]",en,"A team of explorers discover a clue to the origins of mankind on Earth, leading them on a journey to the darkest corners of the universe.

460,461,R.I.P.D.,2013,/wiki/R.I.P.D.,"Boston Police Department officers Detective Sergeant Nick Walker and Detective Lieutenant Bobby Hayes discover and steal several shards of gold while on duty. Nick buries his share under an orange tree sapling in his garden; his wife, Julia, thinks that the tree is a surprise gift and mentions how content she is with their life together. Nick realizes that they do not need the gold, and decides to submit it as evidence. During a raid later on Hayes tells Nick that he cant let him turn in the gold, Hayes then shoots and kills Nick.  Time stops around Nick and he is drawn into a vortex in the sky.In the afterlife, as penance for his thievery, Nick is recruited for the R.I.P.D. (The Rest In Peace Department). The R.I.P.D. is responsible for finding and returning souls who refuse to move on to the afterlife.  Left unchecked, these souls become ""deados"", monsters disguised as humans, and when their souls begin to rot, the environment rots around them. He is partnered with Roycephus ""Roy"" Pulsipher, a former U.S. Marshal and participant in the American Civil War.  Their first stop is at a cemetery to watch Nicks funeral, and Nick attempts to make his presence known to Julia but is not recognized.  Roy explains that R.I.P.D. officers are given new identities and appearances to prevent them from revealing that the afterlife exists.  Nick appears as an old Chinese man while Roy appears as a beautiful blonde woman.  On his first field mission, Nick aids Roy in interrogating a suspected deado and discovers the perpetrator is in possession of gold like he and Hayes had stolen.  Nick and Roy submit the gold as evidence before visiting one of Roys informants.  Nick tricks the informant into revealing Hayes as his contact. They follow Hayes to Nicks old house, where he ""discovers"" Nicks stolen gold. Roy and Nick track Hayes and observe him handing the gold off to a deado whom they stop and interrogate.  The deado overpowers them, taking the gold and transforming into a hulking monster that leads them on a chase through the city that attracts the attention of normal humans and causes a panic.  R.I.P.D. Chief Mildred Proctor receives orders to remove Roy and Nick from the case and from active duty due to this exposure. Proctor learns from Eternal Affairs that the gold could be used to construct the Staff of Jericho, which will reverse the flow of souls from earth to the afterlife.Roy and Nick argue, and Nick leaves by himself to try again to reveal himself to Julia.  Roy tails him and they argue but finally make amends and decide to work together to stop whatever Hayes is planning. They discover that Hayes is a deado and arrest him, but a confiscated item of his freezes the whole department.  Hayes and a group of deados escape with the remainder of the gold and assemble the Staff of Jericho (an Obelisk of gold).  Hayes takes Julia hostage and stabs her as a necessary human sacrifice to activate the staff. A battle ensues; Pulsipher destroys the Staff of Jericho, and Nick exacts his revenge on Hayes. Close to death, Julia sees Nick for who he is; and they share a tearful farewell.Later, Proctor informs Nick that Julia will live. She reinstates them both fully, though she adds 53 years to Roys term in the R.I.P.D. due to her revealed affections for him. As a reward, Roy gives Nick a new appearance, but he is dismayed to find it is that of a Girl Scout.",130000000,"[{""id"": 14, ""name"": ""Fantasy""}, {""id"": 28, ""name"": ""Action""}, {""id"": 35, ""name"": ""Comedy""}, {""id"": 80, ""name"": ""Crime""}]",http://www.ripd.com/,49524,"[{""id"": 1321, ""name"": ""gold""}, {""id"": 4668, ""name"": ""police operation""}, {""id"": 9104, ""name"": ""partner""}, {""id"": 9748, ""name"": ""revenge""}, {""id"": 10327, ""name"": ""undead""}, {""id"": 162846, ""name"": ""ghost""}, {""id"": 207199, ""name"": ""police department""}]",en,A recently slain cop joins a team of undead police officers working for the Rest in Peace Department and tries to find the man who murdered him.

462,463,Ramona and Beezus,2010,/wiki/Ramona_and_Beezus,"The adventurous and creative third-grader Ramona Quimby (Joey King) often finds herself in trouble at school and at home, usually with her best friend, Howie (Jason Spevack).  When her father Robert (John Corbett) loses his job and the family falls into severe debt, Ramonas efforts to earn money end up backfiring in humorous ways. She repeatedly embarrasses her older sister, Beatrice (Selena Gomez), calling her by her family nickname, ""Beezus"", in front of Beatrices crush, the paperboy Henry Huggins (Hutch Dano).  After working as an executive in a storage company since Beezuss birth, Robert causes quarrels with his wife and the girls mother Dorothy (Bridget Moynahan) when he decides to pursue a creative career.Meanwhile, Ramonas visiting aunt Bea (Ginnifer Goodwin) is one of the few people who accept Ramona despite all her eccentricities. After a car-painting accident involving Beas old flame Hobart (Josh Duhamel), Ramona gives up her money-making schemes. The next day, Ramona ruins her school portrait by cracking a raw egg in her hair and responding with disgust when the photographer asks her to say ""Peas"" instead of ""Cheese"".  Ramonas worries increase the following day, when her classmate Susan (Sierra McCormick) reveals that after her own father lost his job, her parents divorced and her father moved to Tacoma. The news makes Ramona sick, and Robert has to pick her up early from school, interfering with a sudden job interview. Instead of being angry, Robert decides to spend the rest of his day drawing a mural with Ramona.Ramona and Beezus attempt to make dinner for their parents, but the pan catches fire while Beezus is on the phone with Henry. During the ensuing argument, Henry overhears that Beezus loves him. Still upset, Ramona goes to feed her cat Picky-Picky but is devastated to find the cat dead. The girls private funeral for Picky-Picky helps them reconcile. A job offer for Robert in Oregon leads Ramonas parents to decide to sell their house. As the family touches up the garden during an open house, Ramona inadvertently initiates a water fight with the neighbors, which floods the neighbors backyard and exposes a box that Hobart buried there years ago.  The box contains mementos of Bea and Hobarts teenage romance, and in light of their rekindling relationship, he proposes to her.  Hesitantly, Bea accepts, and the family begins planning the impromptu wedding.  Furious that her aunt broke her promise not to get ""reeled in"", Ramona rushes home and seeks solace in the attic. The fragile rafters break, leaving Ramonas legs dangling from the ceiling during the open house. After the open house clears out, Robert scolds Ramona for her lack of maturity; Ramona and her mother then berate Robert for showing little compassion for Ramona, and he leaves. He then receives a phone call from her teacher, Mrs. Meachum (Sandra Oh). Feeling unwanted, Ramona decides to run away. Unable to convince Ramona not to leave, her mother helps her pack her suitcase. Opening the heavy suitcase at a bus stop, Ramona discovers that her mother made it heavy on purpose to keep Ramona from traveling far. Inside, her mother has packed a book of Roberts sketches of Ramona.  Her family finds her soon afterward and everyone is happily reunited.At Bea and Hobarts wedding, Ramona saves the day when she finds the wedding ring Howie dropped. During the reception, Beezus and Henry share a kiss and dance together. Robert also receives a job offer from Ramonas school; Mrs. Meachum recommended Robert to the schools board as its new art teacher after she saw the mural that he and Ramona made. Ramona is delighted that the family will not have to move and that Robert and Dorothy reconcile.

463,464,Rango,2011,/wiki/Rango_(2011_film),"A pet chameleon (Johnny Depp) becomes stranded in the Mojave Desert of Nevada after his terrarium falls from his owners car by accident. He meets an armadillo named Roadkill (Alfred Molina) who is seeking the mystical ""Spirit of the West"". While wandering the desert, he narrowly avoids being eaten by a vicious red-tailed hawk before meeting the desert iguana Beans (Isla Fisher). Beans takes him to Dirt, an Old West town populated by desert animals.The chameleon presents himself to the townsfolk as a tough drifter named ""Rango"". He quickly runs afoul of outlaw Gila monster Bad Bill (Ray Winstone) but avoids a shootout when Bill is scared off by the hawks return. Rango is chased by the hawk until he accidentally knocks down an empty water tower which crushes the predator. The town mayor (Ned Beatty), an elderly tortoise, appoints Rango as the new sheriff. Meanwhile, the townsfolk worry that with the hawk dead, the gunslinger Rattlesnake Jake (Bill Nighy), who is afraid of hawks, will return.After discovering Dirts water reserves—stored in the town bank inside a water cooler bottle—to be near empty, a skeptical Beans demands Rango investigate where the water has gone. That night, Rango inadvertently assists a trio of bank robbers, led by a mole named Balthazar (Harry Dean Stanton), mistaking them for prospectors. The townsfolk find their water bottle stolen the next morning, so Rango organizes a posse. During the search, they find the banker, Mr Merrimack (Stephen Root) in the middle of the desert dead, but oddly the cause of his death was drowning. The posse tracks the robbers to their hideout. They fight Balthazars bat-riding clan over the stolen water bottle before discovering it to be empty. The robbers profess that they found it empty, but the posse brings them to town to put them in jail while the citizens want to lynch them.Rango confronts the mayor about his buying of the land around Dirt, but the mayor denies any wrongdoing and shows Rango that he is building a modern city with the purchased land. The mayor then summons Rattlesnake Jake, who forces Rango to admit that he lied to the townsfolk and runs him out of town. Rango returns to the road where he fell from the car, crosses to the other side, and passes out. Rango wakes and meets the Spirit of the West (Timothy Olyphant), whom Rango identifies as the Man with No Name. After telling him what he did to the citizens of Dirt, the Spirit tells Rango that he must go back and set things right, telling him that ""No man can walk out on his own story.""With the aid of Roadkill and mystical moving yuccas, Rango learns that Dirts water supply is controlled by an emergency shut-off valve in a water pipeline to Las Vegas, which the mayor has been manipulating to cause a water shortage so he could buy the land. Rango returns to Dirt to challenge Jake to a duel, a diversion so the yuccas can turn the pipelines valve to flood the town. Rango then holds Jake at gunpoint and makes clear his resolve. The mayor, however, forces Rango to surrender by threatening Beans life and locks them inside the glass bank vault to drown. He then tries to shoot Jake with Rangos gun, intending to kill Jake along with the rest of the Old West, but the gun is empty. Rango has taken the bullet, which he uses to crack the glass and shatter the vault, freeing himself and Beans. Impressed, Jake salutes Rango and drags the mayor into the desert.

464,465,Real Steel,2011,/wiki/Real_Steel,"In 2020, human boxers are replaced by robots. Charlie Kenton, a former boxer, owns ""Ambush"", but loses it in a fight against a bull belonging to promoter and carnival owner Ricky, who rigged the fight to mess with Charlie as he sees him as a joke, partially because he beat him up the last time they competed for bailing on the bet. Having made a bet that Ambush would win as a result, Charlie now has a debt to Ricky that he cant pay—which he runs out on.After the fight, Charlie learns that his ex-girlfriend died and he must attend a hearing deciding the future of their son, Max Kenton, whom Charlie has had almost zero contact with and complete apathy towards since he was born. There, Maxs aunt, Debra, and her wealthy husband, Marvin, request full custody, which Charlie concedes for $100,000, half in advance, on the condition that Charlie retains Max for three months while they are on vacation and the other half when they return. Thereupon, Charlie, Max, and Bailey Tallet, the daughter of Charlies former boxing coach, acquire the once-famous ""Noisy Boy"", but it is destroyed in a subsequent fight against ""Midas"". As he and Charlie attempt to scavenge parts to make a new robot from a junkyard, Max discovers ""Atom"", an obsolete but intact sparring robot designed to withstand severe damage, that is capable of mirroring opponent and handler movements and storing them in its memory due to its rare ""shadow function"".At Maxs behest, Charlie pits Atom against ""Metro"", whom Atom overcomes. Max programs Noisy Boys vocal-respond controls in Atom, and convinces Charlie to help him with Atoms fighting move memory, resulting in a series of victories and culminating to being offered a fight in World Robot Boxing against national champion ""Twin Cities"". After reaching the arena, the owner of global champion ""Zeus"" offers to buy Atom, which Max instantly rejects. Charlie disagrees, but eventually takes Maxs side. The fight starts with Atom on the attack, but Twin Cities easily takes the offensive and corners Atom. While their opponent has no blind spot, Charlie notices a hitch whenever Twin Cities throws a right jab. Using this, Charlie is able to get Atom out of the corner and eventually win by knockout. Elated by their success, Max challenges Zeus, publicly, with the audience squarely on their side. After the fight, Ricky and his two henchmen ambush Charlie for bailing earlier and rob them of their winnings, prompting Charlie to return Max to Debra.This upsets Max, and when Charlie tries to convince him that living without him is better for Max, Max says he always wanted Charlie to fight for him and be there as a father. After Max leaves, Charlie returns to Bailey. While talking with her about the events, the two kiss, revealing their attraction to each other. Persuaded by Bailey, Charlie arranges the challenge offered by Max and convinces Debra to allow Max to witness the fight.Zeus starts the fight by knocking Atom down with its first punch, but Atom gets up, and Zeus continues its assault, knocking Atom down multiple times. However, each time Atom gets back up, and eventually is able to land its first punch allowing Atom to survive the first round. Ricky, who had made a bet with a friend of Charlies of $100,000 that Atom would not last the round, tries to slip away, but is cornered by the fights bookmakers. The fight continues with Atom landing multiple punches but also getting knocked down many times and recovering each time. Late in the fourth round, Atoms vocal-respond controls are damaged, forcing Charlie to use its visual ""shadow function"" to make it visually mimic his boxing skills. This, and the fact that Zeus starts running out of power from its constant offense, tip the odds in Atoms favor, forcing Zeus programmer to manually control it, and Max and Bailey both watch Charlie doing what he was meant to do, and are touched by seeing him literally fighting for his son. Zeus gets a sound beating, once even hitting the ground and barely avoiding losing by knockout, but survives the final round and wins the match by the judges decision.

465,466,RED 2,2013,/wiki/RED_2_(film),"Three years after the previous film, while trying to lead a normal life with girlfriend Sarah Ross, Frank Moses is approached by Marvin Boggs, who claims people are still after them, but Frank dismisses him. After appealing a second time, Marvin drives off, and his car explodes. Although Frank does not believe Marvin is dead, Sarah convinces him to go to Marvins funeral where he delivers a teary-eyed eulogy.After the funeral, a group of government agents approach Frank and take him to be interrogated at an FBI run Yankee White Facility. During the interrogation, Jack Horton appears with a team of private military contractors, kills most of the facilitys personnel, and tells Frank that he will torture Sarah until he gets information out of Frank. Frank escapes from the room, evades Hortons assassins, and with the sudden timely help of Marvin, who turns out to be alive, goes on the run with Sarah.In a diner, Marvin explains that he and Frank are being hunted because they were listed as participants in a clandestine operation codenamed Nightshade, conducted during the Cold War to smuggle a nuclear weapon into Russia piece by piece. Horton has convinced world agencies that Frank and his crew are terrorists and must be stopped. Victoria calls, telling Frank she has been contracted by MI6 to kill the three of them. Meanwhile, top contract killer Han Cho-Bai, whom Horton knows is seeking revenge on Frank, is also hired.Frank, Marvin, and Sarah steal Hans plane and fly to Paris to find a man nicknamed ""The Frog"", with the Americans and Han in pursuit. As they arrive in Paris, they are stopped by Katja, a Russian secret agent with whom Frank had a relationship earlier in his career. Katja is also in search of Nightshade, and joins them to find The Frog. When he sees them, The Frog flees. Frank and Katja catch him and bring him back to his house, where Sarah seduces him, both to help them and to prove she is a better girlfriend than Katja.The Frog gives them the key to his security box, which Katja apparently takes from Frank after drugging him; but Marvin, anticipating this, had handed a similar-looking key to Frank before his meeting with her. Marvin, Frank, and Sarah later find documents in The Frogs security box which point to Dr. Edward Bailey, a brilliant physicist, as the creator of the Operation Nightshade bomb.They find that Bailey is alive, held thirty-two years in a maximum security asylum for the criminally insane in London. Victoria (alerted by Marvin) unexpectedly confronts the trio, but helps to fake their deaths and then gain access to the asylum, in which Victoria feigns insanity, while Frank and Sarah pose as the facility staff, having tied up and gagged the real staff with duct tape. Frank and Victoria meet Bailey, who is hyperactive and cannot rationally respond to their questions thanks to mind-fogging drugs the asylum had been giving him, so they take him to one of Marvins safehouses. After the drugs begin to wear off, Bailey remembers the bomb is still in Moscow.They travel to Moscow, and Bailey concludes he hid the bomb in the Kremlin. They break into the Kremlin, and Bailey locates the suitcase-sized bomb, which is powered by red mercury, which has no radioactive signature and causes no fallout. As they are about to leave, Katja stops them. Frank persuades her to switch to their side. After they escape and are celebrating, Victoria, who has escaped MI6 imprisonment for failing to kill him, calls Frank from London and tells him that Bailey was locked up because he had wanted to detonate the bomb, not sell it.Bailey quickly holds Frank at gunpoint and confirms Victorias message, revealing that he made a deal with Horton and the Americans to give them the red mercury. He shoots Katja, making it look as if Frank killed her, and leaves with the bomb case. Horton reneges on his deal with Bailey, intending to interrogate him until all his secrets have been tortured out of him, but Bailey escapes during air transit using a nerve gas he created, administering the antidote to both himself and Horton. Bailey then moves to the Iranian embassy in London. Before Frank can follow him, Han attacks. Reaching a standoff, Frank urges Han to join sides with him and stop the bomb. Han finally relents, and the five enact a plan to recapture Bailey and the bomb.Sarah first seduces the Iranian ambassador, then takes him hostage. Marvin poses as a person seeking to defect to Iran, causes a diversion with the embassy plumbing, and the disguised team comes to ""fix"" it. They discover in the ambassadors safe plans disclosing the location of the bomb, but find that Bailey has already triggered the bombs countdown timer and killed Horton (after disclosing he also remembered how his family had been killed by people like Horton). When they are discovered by embassy guards, Bailey seizes Sarah and flees to the airport to escape the imminent explosion.Frank, Marvin, Victoria, and Han, taking the active bomb case with them, give chase, but Marvin, in his attempts to disarm the bomb by cutting wires, causes the timer to speed up and count down even faster. Frank, holding the bomb case, boards the plane and confronts Bailey who releases Sarah and forcefully insists he take the bomb off the plane with her. They rejoin Marvin, Victoria, and Han and wait for death as Hans plane takes off. As it disappears high in the sky it explodes in an immense fireball. Frank reveals that he had covertly placed the bomb from the case into a compartment near the planes exit and confronted Bailey with only a closed empty case. Han angrily tells Frank that Frank owes him ""$30 million for the plane and $20 million for not killing you (Frank)"".The closing scene shows Sarah enjoying herself on a mission in Caracas with Frank and Marvin.",84000000,"[{""id"": 28, ""name"": ""Action""}, {""id"": 35, ""name"": ""Comedy""}, {""id"": 80, ""name"": ""Crime""}, {""id"": 53, ""name"": ""Thriller""}]",http://red-themovie.com/,146216,"[{""id"": 90, ""name"": ""paris""}, {""id"": 212, ""name"": ""london england""}, {""id"": 591, ""name"": ""cia""}, {""id"": 2139, ""name"": ""russia""}, {""id"": 14555, ""name"": ""mi6""}, {""id"": 166571, ""name"": ""hired killer""}, {""id"": 182185, ""name"": ""exploding airplane""}]",en,Retired C.I.A. agent Frank Moses reunites his unlikely team of elite operatives for a global quest to track down a missing portable nuclear device.,44.34333,"[{""name"": ""DC Comics"", ""id"": 429}, {""name"": ""Di Bonaventura Pictures"", ""id"": 435}, {""name"": ""Summit Entertainment"", ""id"": 491}, {""name"": ""DC Entertainment"", ""id"": 9993}]","[{""iso_3166_1"": ""CA"", ""name"": ""Canada""}, {""iso_3166_1"": ""FR"", ""name"": ""France""}, {""iso_3166_1"": ""US"", ""name"": ""United States of America""}]",7/18/2013,0,116,"[{""iso_639_1"": ""en"", ""name"": ""English""}, {""iso_639_1"": ""fr"", ""name"": ""Fran\u00e7ais""}, {""iso_639_1"": ""ru"", ""name"": ""P\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439""}]",Released,The best never rest.,RED 2,6.4,1526,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0,0,0,0,0
466,467,Red Riding Hood,2011,/wiki/Red_Riding_Hood_(2011_film),"Valerie is a young woman who lives in the village of Daggerhorn, on the edge of a forest plagued by a werewolf, with her parents, Cesaire and Suzette, and older sister Lucie. She is in love with the town woodcutter Peter, but her parents have arranged for her to marry Henry Lazar, son of the wealthy blacksmith Adrien Lazar. Valerie and Peter plan to run away together, only to learn that the Wolf has broken its truce not to prey on the townspeople in exchange for cattle stock sacrifices and has murdered Lucie, who is revealed to have had a crush on Henry Lazar.Suzette learns of Peter and Valeries love, telling Valerie she too did not love her husband at first, but learned to love him – that she had loved another. Father Auguste, the local preacher, calls for the famous witch hunter, Father Solomon, to help them but the townspeople decide to venture into the Wolfs lair to destroy it. They divide into groups, with one consisting of Peter, Henry, and Adrien. Peter separates from them moments before the Wolf attacks and murders Adrien. The Wolf is cornered by the men and killed. Valerie finds Suzette mourning Adrien and discerns that he was her love. She also realizes that Lucie, being the older daughter, shouldve been the first to wed and should have been engaged to Henry, but could not as she was the illegitimate daughter of Adrien, making her Henrys half-sister.The following day, as the people celebrate, Father Solomon arrives and reveals that, had they killed the Wolf, it would have returned to its human form as it is a werewolf, but what they slew was a common grey wolf. He also reveals that theyve entered the Blood Moon Week, an event that happens every thirteen years, in which whoever is bitten by the Wolf is cursed to become one as well. Father Solomons men, led by The Captain (Adrian Holmes), isolate Daggerhorn and begin to investigate its people in search of the Wolf. That night, the Wolf attacks and, while the townspeople rush to the Church (as the Wolf is unable to step onto holy ground), Valerie and her friend Roxanne venture into the village to search for Roxannes autistic brother, Claude. They are cornered by the creature and Valerie discovers that she is able to understand the Wolfs sounds. It threatens to kill Roxanne and destroy the village if Valerie doesnt leave with it. The Wolf then escapes, vowing to return to learn Valeries decision.The following day, Claude is captured by Father Solomons men. Having witnessed Claude performing a card trick earlier, Father Solomon claims hes a student of the dark arts and attempts to force the frightened Claude to reveal the Wolfs identity. When Claude is unable to do so, Father Solomon locks him up in a large iron elephant brazen bull. In exchange for Claudes release, Roxanne reveals that Valerie is able to communicate with the Wolf but Claude is already dead by the time the Captain opens the elephant. Believing Valerie to be a witch, Father Solomon has her captured and displayed at the towns square in order to lure the Wolf out so he can kill it. Henry and Peter join forces and help Valerie to escape. Peter is captured by the Captain and thrown into the elephant, while Father Solomon orders Henry to be killed for helping Valerie. Father Auguste saves Henry and is then killed by Father Solomon.Henry takes Valerie to the church, but they are attacked by the Wolf, who bites off Father Solomons hand, which contains silver-coated fingernails. The townspeople shield Valerie from the Wolf, who is once again forced to flee, but not before burning a paw by touching holy land. The now cursed Father Solomon is subsequently killed by the Captain.Valerie dreams that the Wolf is her grandmother, who lives in a cabin in the nearby woods, so she goes to check on her. After retrieving Father Solomons hand on the way, Valerie rushes to her grandmothers cabin, but is confronted on the way by Peter. She then notices that he is wearing a glove on his right hand, the same paw that the Wolf burned trying to enter the church, Valerie assumes Peter is the Wolf and stabs him. Arriving at Grandmothers house, Valerie is horrified to find her dead, and learns that the Wolf is her father, Cesaire. He reveals that the curse was passed to him by his own father, and he intended to leave the village but wanted to take his children with him. He sent a note to Lucie pretending to be Henry to meet him at night so he could ask her to accept her ""gift"". However, when he confronted her, she couldnt understand him. Realizing Lucie was not his daughter, Cesaire murdered her in a fit of rage. He then took revenge against Adrien, his wifes lover, and now wants Valerie to accept the curse.Valerie refuses, just as Peter appears and confronts Cesaire, who bites Peter (thus giving him the curse) and tosses him aside. Peter is able to throw an axe into Cesaires back, distracting him. Valerie stabs Cesaire to death with Father Solomons hand. Valerie and Peter fill Cesaires body with rocks so he can never be found and dump the body in the lake. Peter departs in order to learn how to control his curse, vowing to return only when hes able to ensure Valeries safety. Valerie narrates that Henry found his courage and joins the ranks of the Captains monster hunters. Valeries mother finally accepts that her husband will never come home, and the village continues to live in fear even though the wolf never returned.

467,468,Red Tails,2012,/wiki/Red_Tails,"In 1944, as the air war over Europe enters a deadly phase with increasing losses of Allied bombers, the 332d Fighter Group (the Tuskegee Airmen) consisting of young African-American USAAF fighter pilots, after enduring racism throughout their recruitment and training in the Tuskegee training program, are finally sent into combat in Italy. Although flying worn-out Curtiss P-40 Warhawk aircraft and chafing at their ground attack missions, the  Tuskegee Airmen recognize they may never fight the Luftwaffe. The tight-knit group of Capt. Martin ""Easy"" Julian, 1st Lt. Joe ""Lightning"" Little, 2nd Lt. Ray ""Ray Gun"" Gannon, 2nd Lt. Andrew ""Smokey"" Salem, and 2nd Lt. Samuel ""Joker"" George under the guidance of Major Emanuel Stance and Col. A.J. Bullard, face a white military bureaucracy still resistant to accepting black flyers as equals.Strife develops between friends Easy and Lightning, each of whom battles his own inner demons: Lightning is a hotheaded and reckless pilot, while Easy is an alcoholic prone to self-doubt. After returning to base, Lightning becomes infatuated with Sofia, an Italian girl, and starts a relationship. When Lightning punches a white man who uses a racial slur at a ""whites only"" officers club, he is sent to the brig and reprimanded by Colonel Bullard.Meanwhile, Bullard secures a chance to ""light up the board"" when the Tuskegee Airmen are chosen to support the Allied landings at Anzio, Italy known as Operation Shingle. There, they battle Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighters led by a German ace pilot they nickname ""Pretty Boy"" and manage to raze the base that Pretty Boy retreats back to. Pretty Boy is stunned to see the pilots who damaged his plane and razed his base were African-Americans. During their first victory, Ray Gun is injured by anti-aircraft fire and suffers impaired vision in one eye. Easy reluctantly allows Ray Gun to continue flying.Impressed with the Tuskegee Airmens performance, the USAAF Bomber Command ask Bullard to use his fighters as escorts for Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress bombers because of unacceptably high casualties among bomber crews. Bullard accepts on the condition his unit be supplied with the new North American P-51 Mustang. The tails of the aircraft are painted bright red and become the unofficial name of the outfit. Noting the reckless aggression of previous escort fights, Bullard orders his pilots to stay with the bombers at all costs. Their first escort mission is a success, and the 332nd downs multiple Luftwaffe aircraft without the loss of a single bomber. Lightning even takes his chances to attack a Kriegsmarine destroyer before returning to base. However, Ray Gun is shot down and captured by a Wehrmacht patrol, while Deke crash lands and nearly dies, but is rescued from his burning Mustang before the fuel tank explodes.As a result of his injuries, Deke is discharged, and Ray Gun is taken to Stalag 18, a German POW camp. A group of POWs recruit him, as they believe he cannot be a German spy. Easy blames himself for Ray Guns death and spirals deeper into alcoholism. Worried, Lightning makes a deal with Easy: he will fly less recklessly as long as Easy remains sober. Meanwhile, attitudes against the Tuskegee Airmen begin to change as they earn the bomber crews respect. Lightning proposes to Sofia, who accepts as long as he stays in Italy. Ray Gun and his group of POWs escape, but German guards spot several POWs; Ray Gun draws the Germans attention while the others escape. One of the POWs reaches the 332nds base and informs them about Ray Guns sacrifice, assuming him to be dead.The Tuskegee Airmen are tasked with escorting the first American bombers to attack Berlin, though for propaganda reasons they are only asked to escort the bombers on the first leg of their journey. When the fighter squadron meant to relieve them never arrives, Easy stays with bombers. They are attacked by Pretty Boy, now leading a flight of the revolutionary new Messerschmitt Me 262 jet fighters. Despite being outclassed, the Tuskegee Airmen shoot down several enemies, along with escorting a wounded B-17 back to Allied airspace. Pretty Boy nearly shoots down Easy, but at the last moment, Lightning attacks and kills Pretty Boy in a head-on attack. Although victorious, Lightning is mortally wounded and dies, with his Mustang crashing soon after. Easy is then forced to inform Sofia about Lightnings death and consequently overcomes his alcoholism. At Lightnings funeral, Ray Gun returns, having survived his escape from German captivity, invoking Lightnings memory.Ultimately, the Tuskegee Airmen are awarded the Presidential Unit Citation in honor of their achievements.",58000000,"[{""id"": 18, ""name"": ""Drama""}, {""id"": 28, ""name"": ""Action""}, {""id"": 12, ""name"": ""Adventure""}, {""id"": 36, ""name"": ""History""}, {""id"": 10752, ""name"": ""War""}]",http://www.redtails2012.com/,72431,"[{""id"": 1956, ""name"": ""world war ii""}, {""id"": 2533, ""name"": ""fighter pilot""}, {""id"": 15089, ""name"": ""fighter plane""}]",en,"The story of the Tuskegee Airmen, the first African-American pilots to fly in a combat squadron during World War II.",12.29603,"[{""name"": ""Lucasfilm"", ""id"": 1}, {""name"": ""Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation"", ""id"": 306}, {""name"": ""Partnership Pictures"", ""id"": 22883}]","[{""iso_3166_1"": ""US"", ""name"": ""United States of America""}]",1/19/2012,50365377,125,"[{""iso_639_1"": ""en"", ""name"": ""English""}, {""iso_639_1"": ""fr"", ""name"": ""Fran\u00e7ais""}, {""iso_639_1"": ""de"", ""name"": ""Deutsch""}]",Released,High-Octane Action and Daring Dogfights!,Red Tails,5.9,178,0.110681981,0.5,0.5,0.5,0,0,-0.389318019,0.129772673,0.868368569

469,470,Repo Men,2010,/wiki/Repo_Men,"In 2025, advancements in medical technology have perfected bio-mechanical organs. A corporation known as The Union sells these expensive ""artiforgs"" on credit, and when customers are unable or unwilling to pay for their artiforgs The Union sends ""repo men"" to locate and forcibly repossess the organ- invariably resulting in the death of the owner. Remy and his partner Jake Freivald are considered the best of the Unions repo men. However, Remys wife Carol disapproves of his work, believing that it is a bad influence for their son Peter. At a family barbecue, Remy allows Jake to discreetly perform a repossession nearby, but is caught by Carol who leaves with Peter in anger.While patrolling with Jake, the duo discovers a ""nest"", a refuge for Union customers who have defaulted on payments for their artiforgs and are attempting to escape the country. Remy and Jake raid the nest by themselves, impressing their boss, Frank. He offers them the opportunity to become full-time raid captains. Remy declines and attempts to ask Frank to transfer to sales, but Jake cuts him off. Jake tells Remy that what they do is important, but Remys mind is made up. Jake suggests that Remys last job be a musician that Remy is a fan of. After helping the musician finish one last song, he uses a defibrillator in order to stop the artificial heart, but the device malfunctions, and Remy is severely injured, requiring replacement of his heart with an artiforg.Carol divorces Remy for taking another job, so he moves in with Jake.  As he tries to go back to work, he realizes hes developed sympathy for the customers, unable to lie when he tries sales, but also unable to kill when repossessing their artiforgs. Hes soon unable to make the payments on his heart and is in debt.  Jake discovers that Remy has not been repossessing and takes him to a ""nest"" with enough artiforgs to clear his debt; however, Remy cannot do the job. Furious, Jake demands he stay there until he gets over his inhibition. A stunned debtor wakes up and knocks Remy out.Waking up, Remy encounters Beth, a singer he would see while drinking in a bar with Jake. He takes her to a motel room and discovers she has numerous artiforgs. Breaking into the office, Remy attempts to clear Beths and his own accounts, but he is interrupted by Jake, who lets him leave. On the run, Beth and Remy leave for the abandoned outskirts of the city. Beth tells Remy of how she contracted various diseases and was involved in a car crash, and was forced to resort to buying artiforgs on the black market after running up severe debts. They begin a relationship, and Remy decides to document his life as a repo man with an old typewriter Beth found. As he works on a manuscript, he is interrupted by a repo man. Remy sets a trap and the collector drops through a hole in the floor. Beth falls through the same hole, damaging her prosthetic knee. Before the collector can shoot Beth, Remy manages to kill him.Remy sneaks into his former workplace to obtain scanning jammers he had confiscated during his raid on the nest. He attempts to force Frank to clear his account, only to discover that accounts can now only be cleared at the Unions central office due to his earlier attempt. Remy and Beth attempt to flee the country at the airport, but security is alerted by bleeding from Beths knee. A fight with airport security ensues. Jake arrives, but is on the wrong side of a security panel and watches their escape. They go to a black market doctor to replace Beths knee.After the procedure, they are stopped by Jake who tries to convince to Remy to rejoin him as a repo man. Remy refuses, and Jake reveals he rigged the defibrillator unit that caused his heart to fail, so Remy would continue to work with him. They fight, and Jake knocks Remy unconscious. Beth awakens Remy, saying she stunned Jake as an organ repossession raid is underway. They flee and Remy decides to delete the accounts of all implant clients. Remy meets Carol and Peter on a train one last time, passing on his manuscript to Peter.Remy and Beth break into Union headquarters and are forced to fight their way through the facility to the Unions database. Using Beths prosthetic eye, they enter and seal themselves inside as Jake and Frank arrive. The servers only interface is an organ scanner, requiring Remy and Beth to cut themselves open to use the scanner internally on each of their artiforgs, clearing their accounts. Frank and Jake enter the server room using an artiforg from one of the slain repo men, finding Beth near death and Remy attempting to scan her heart. Jake is ordered to kill Remy, but he instead kills Frank and helps revive Beth. Jake tosses two grenades into the artiforg drawer of the server, with the explosion destroying the mainframe, wiping the records of everyone who has an account with the Union.Later, Remy is seen on a tropical beach, enjoying his freedom with Beth and Jake. His text has been published as a book, The Repossession Mambo. While Remy talks to Jake, he notices that Jake suddenly disappears, leaving Remys book on his chair; then Remy sees the beach flicker with static before returning to normal. It is revealed that Remy is in a coma, having sustained severe brain damage when Jake knocked him unconscious. Jake has paid off Remys debt for his heart and also paid to link his brain to a neural network, allowing him to live out his life peacefully in a computer generated dream world. Beth is unconscious, and Jake says he will take care of her; he then says a sorrowful goodbye to Remy.

472,473,Resident Evil: Extinction,2010,/wiki/Resident_Evil:_Extinction,"Alice (Milla Jovovich) wakes up disoriented in a mansion. Wandering through its halls, she is forced to escape several security traps. However, she is eventually killed by a bounding mine hidden in the floor. Her body is dumped into a pit filled with dozens of Alice copies and is revealed to be one of many clones being produced inside of an underground facility whose entrance above ground is surrounded by thousands of zombies.Despite the best efforts of the bio-tech company Umbrella Corporation to cover up the contamination of The Hive and the release of the T-virus to the surface, going so far as to authorize the bombing of Raccoon City, the T-virus has spread around the world. As the virus spread, it affected not only humans, but other animals as well, and the environment deteriorated, turning cities into desolate landscapes and the wilderness into wastelands. The real Alice (from whom the clones are made) wanders the wastelands of the Southwestern U.S. On her travels, she finds a dead mans diary which states that there is an uninfected area in Alaska.  She later begins to realize that she has developed telekinetic abilities due to the experiments performed on her.Meanwhile, Dr. Alexander Isaacs (Iain Glen), former head of Project Alice and the head of the North American Umbrella facility seen earlier (based in Nevada), considers Alices recapture to be a top priority, since she has the ability to bond with the T-virus and not suffer mutation. He tries to persuade the Umbrella board, operating via holograms from the worldwide Umbrella facility, that he can use her blood to develop a permanent cure as well as tame the infected zombies. The new Umbrella chairman Albert Wesker (Jason OMara) orders Isaacs to use the clones to create a cure, and he refuses to authorize Alices recapture until they are informed of her location.Meanwhile, a convoy of survivors led by Claire Redfield (Ali Larter) travels across the country in search of supplies. The convoy includes Raccoon City survivors Carlos Oliveira (Oded Fehr) and L.J. (Mike Epps), along with new survivors K-Mart (Spencer Locke), Mikey (Christopher Egan), Chase (Linden Ashby), Otto (Joe Hursley) and Nurse Betty (Ashanti Douglas), among others.While searching a motel for supplies, L.J. is bitten by a zombie, which he keeps secret. The next morning the convoy is attacked by crows that had been feeding on the infected. The crows almost overwhelm the convoy, killing Nurse Betty and Otto and taking out the flamethrower operator, causing the weapon to careen out of control. Alice finally appears and saves Carlos and the others from a fiery death, using her telekinesis to fill the sky with fire, killing the crows and leaving her unconscious. After recovering, Alice is introduced to Claire and gives her the diary she found, and she and Carlos then convince Claire to take her convoy to Alaska.Dr. Isaacs attempts to domesticate the infected have led to a new zombie breed that remembers basic things, such as how to use phones and cameras. Weskers security officer, Captain Alexander Slater (Matthew Marsden), is adamant about Isaacs disregard for Umbrellas regulations. Wesker, in private, informs Slater to keep watch on Isaacs actions, and tells Slater that if Issacs disobeys orders, Slater should kill Isaacs.Umbrella triangulates Alices location based on the signal sent out by her telekinetic abilities. Dr. Isaacs has a crate of his new zombies sent to ambush the convoy, against Weskers specific orders. L.J. succumbs to his infection and bites Carlos. Most of the convoy, including Mikey and Chase, are killed in the ambush. Umbrella tries to shut Alice down remotely, but she breaks free from their programming and continues to fight. She finds Isaacs at the scene, and he becomes infected as he flees via helicopter. Alice and K-Mart use Isaacs computer to track the helicopters flight path, leading them to Umbrellas underground location.The convoy heads over to the site, which is surrounded by thousands of zombies. Carlos sacrifices himself by plowing his truck into the zombie mob and blowing the rig apart, giving Alice and Claire time to load survivors into the helicopter. Alice decides to stay behind. Ordered by Wesker to terminate Isaacs, Slater arrives with a group of commandos and finds the scientist locked in his lab, injecting himself with massive doses of anti-virus in an attempt to counteract the infection. Slater reveals that his employment is terminated and shoots him, triggering a mutation that transforms Isaacs into a monstrous creature. Despite retaining his intelligence and thought, Isaacs kills Slater and all the facility employees, but is confined to the labs lower levels.Entering the facility, Alice meets a holograph of the Red Queens ""sister"" AI, the White Queen (Madeline Carroll). The White Queen informs Alice that her blood is the cure to the T-virus, while also defending the Red Queens prior actions. She then tells Alice about Dr. Isaacs. Alice agrees to deal with him. On her way to the labs lower levels, Alice discovers one of her clones, still in development. The clone awakens, but appears to die from shock shortly after. Alice soon discovers a replica of the Racoon City mansion deep within the complex and finds Isaacs.  The two engage in a fight, eventually leading them to a replica of The Hives laser corridor, where Isaacs is killed by the laser-defense system. Just as Alice is about to meet the same fate, the system is deactivated by her clone, whom is revealed to still be alive.Later, in Tokyo, Japan, Wesker, who is the head of the Tokyo Umbrella facility, informs the rest of the Umbrella chairmen (all holograms) that the North American facility has been lost. Alices hologram makes an appearance, declaring that she is coming for him, and shes bringing some of her ""friends.""

473,474,Resident Evil: Retribution,2012,/wiki/Resident_Evil:_Retribution,"Alice and the others on the Umbrella Corporation freighter Arcadia, now face an attack by an assaulting fleet of tiltrotor V-22 Ospreys led by Alices former ally, Jill Valentine, resulting in the killing of many of the survivors in the ship. Alice is captured during the attack while the fates of Chris Redfield, Claire Redfield and K-Mart are left ambiguous.The story switches to a suburban Alice living with her husband, Todd, and her deaf daughter Becky. Zombies attack, revealing the suburbia was actually Raccoon City during the contamination incident. Alice and Becky manage to run away from the undead, with the help of Rain Ocampo, by letting them ride in her car. As the three escape, they are hit by a garbage truck, knocking Rain unconscious. Alice hides Becky, but is killed by a zombified Todd.Meanwhile, the real Alice awakens in an underground facility and is interrogated by Jill. During a power failure, Alice escapes her cell and the laser grid, finding herself in a simulation of Shibuya Square, Tokyo. Fighting her way out against zombies, she enters a control room filled with dead Umbrella employees and encounters Ada Wong, one of Albert Weskers top agents. Wesker appears on a screen, explaining that they no longer serve Umbrella and the power outage was staged by Weskers hacking into the facilitys computer mainframe. Wesker also reveals that the Red Queen, one of Alices arch-enemies, was reactivated after the Hive incident and now controls Umbrella. He furthermore explains that the facility is underwater, located in Kamchatka, Russia, and that it formerly served as a Soviet naval outpost.The facility was designed by Umbrella for manufacturing clones and creating simulated outbreaks to show the effect of the T-virus. Ada and Alice plan to rendezvous with a rescue crew organized by Wesker, which includes Leon Kennedy, Barry Burton, and Luther West (Alices former ally, who survived after the outbreak in Los Angeles). Leons team plants explosives near the entrance of the facility, which will detonate in two hours to ensure the facilitys destruction. The group plans to meet with Alice and Ada in the Raccoon City suburbia area. In a New York City simulation, Alice and Ada defeat two Executioners. Leon and his team enter a Moscow simulation (Red Square in front of the GUM façade), but they are cut off by a heavily armed Las Plagas undead horde, which has surrounded them.In the Suburban setting, Alice and Ada encounter Becky, who mistakes Alice for her clone mother, and is instantly attached to her. They also encounter the clones of Alices deceased allies; James ""One"" Shade, ""evil"" Rain Ocampo and Carlos Olivera, who are sent to capture them. During the shootout which was triggered by Ada, she gives Alice her smart glasses and her grappling hook so that she and Becky can find their way out, and they become separated. They encounter the ""good"" clone of Rain (who they met in Suburbia at the beginning) in the Moscow simulation (Arbatskaya metro station), and Alice gives her a weapon. She then rescues Leons surviving crew from the barrage of Las Plagas zombies and a giant Licker. Once united, the group heads toward the tunnel and reaches the submarine pens in the facility exit, but they are ambushed by Jills team. Becky is captured by the Licker, and ""good"" Rain is killed, breaking her neck after being thrown by the Licker. Alice rescues Becky, and also kills the Licker using a belt of grenades she found. Barry sacrifices himself in the process, holding the Umbrella operatives off long enough to ensure the others escape. Using Leons bombs, they finally manage to destroy the facility, allowing Leon and Luther to escape, while Alice and Becky also survive, having used the ventilation system.On the surface, their snowmobile is knocked over by Jill Valentines Oscar-Class submarine. Jill and ""bad"" Rain confront the group with Ada being held as their hostage. Jill and Alice begin fighting each other, while Rain – now also enhanced with the Las Plagas parasite, granting her superhuman strength and healing – fights Leon and Luther. Alice is able to tear the mind-controlling scarab off Jills chest, returning her to her normal self. Unfortunately, Rain also kills Luther in the process, while Leon is knocked out. Realizing that they cant kill Rain, Alice shoots the ice under her feet and she is dragged down by the swimming zombies from the undersea installation to be devoured, killing her for good. Alice, Ada, Becky, Leon, and Jill travel to Weskers headquarters, a heavily barricaded and fortified White House, staffed by the remainders of the U.S. Armed Forces. Alice meets Wesker in the heavily barricaded Oval Office, where he injects her with the T-virus, returning her superhuman abilities; as only Alice successfully bonded with it, she is the ultimate weapon. On the roof, Wesker explains that the Red Queen is trying to wipe out humanity, and all of the remaining uninfected humans are in the base; it is humanitys last stand.

474,475,Riddick,2013,/wiki/Riddick_(film),"Five years after Kyras death, Riddick has become increasingly uneasy in his role as Lord Marshal of the Necromonger fleet. His refusal to swear into the Necromonger faith has caused dissent among his subjects and assassination attempts by his subordinates. After the latest attempt on his life, Riddick strikes a deal with Commander Vaako: the location of Furya and a ship to take him there, in exchange for Vaako succeeding him as the next Lord Marshal, so that he can achieve what he calls transcendence. Led by Vaakos aide, Krone, Riddick and a group of Necromongers arrive on a desolate planet. Realizing that it is not Furya, Riddick kills most of his escort when they attempt to assassinate him. In the chaos, Krone causes a landslide and buries Riddick alive.Riddick emerges from the rubble with a broken leg, which he sets and splints while fending off native predators: vulture-like flying animals, packs of jackal-like beasts and swarms of venomous, scorpion-like water-dwelling creatures called Mud Demons. Needing time to heal, Riddick hides himself within some abandoned ruins. After hes fully healed, Riddick notices a vast savanna beyond some rocky cliffs, but the only passage through is impeded by several muddy pools infested with Mud Demons. He begins injecting himself with Mud Demon venom in order to build an immunity and constructs improvised melee weapons, as well as raising and training an orphaned jackal-beast pup. He kills the Mud Demons and reaches the savannah. After finding a dormant mercenary station, Riddick notices a series of approaching storms, and concludes they will unleash an unidentified threat. Riddick activates an emergency beacon at the station, which broadcasts his identity to mercenary groups within the area.Two ships promptly arrive in answer to the beacon, the first a group led by a violent and unstable man named Santana, and also team of professional mercenaries led by a man named Colonel R. ""Boss"" Johns. Riddick leaves them a message promising they will all die unless they leave one of their ships and depart the planet on the other. Rubio, Nunez and Falco are killed by Riddick during the first night, forcing a reluctant Santana to cooperate with Johns. Riddick later steals power nodes from each of the teams ships and approaches Johns and Santana to strike a deal for their return. However, the conversation turns into an ambush: Johns second-in-command, Dahl, shoots Riddick with several rounds of horse tranquilizer, and Riddicks jackal-beast is shot and killed by Santana.Back at the Station, Johns interrogates Riddick about the fate of his son, William J. Johns (the mercenary from Pitch Black). When the storms reach the station, Riddicks threat is revealed as thousands of Mud Demons emerge from hibernation underground, awakened by the rainwater, and besiege the station, killing Lockspur and Moss. Johns agrees to release Riddick in order to locate the hidden power cells. Santana attempts to kill Riddick, who is worth twice as much dead as he is alive. Riddick, with only one leg free, beheads Santana with his own machete, something he had promised to do. The group then releases Riddick.They fight their way to the ship, with Vargas being killed. Johns, Santanas man Diaz, and Riddick leave the ship together on the hover-bikes to retrieve the power nodes. During their journey, Diaz knocks Johns bike over the side of an embankment, causing him to crash. He is then picked up by Riddick. After they reach the power nodes, Riddick reveals Johns sons morphine addiction, as well as an attempt by William Johns to utilize a child as bait for the creatures on the world they were stranded on ten years prior. Diaz attempts to kill Riddick and Johns. Riddick fights and kills him, but a dying Diaz damages the only working hover bike, having already sabotaged the other.Riddick and Boss Johns fend off a seemingly endless horde of Mud Demons while running back to the station. Riddick is severely wounded. Johns takes both nodes and abandons Riddick. Riddick begins to fight a futile battle against the advancing Demons. Just when it seems he is about to be killed, Johns arrives in one of the ships and shoots the creatures while Dahl descends to rescue Riddick. Giving him the other ship, Johns asks Riddick where he intends to go, before deciding he is better off not knowing. Riddick praises Johns for being a better man than his son and departs into deep space.In the theatrical version, this is the end of the film, while in the extended version, there is an additional scene which takes place aboard the Necromonger capital ship where Riddick kills Krone and finds out that Vaako has crossed the threshold into the Underverse, seen as a large hole in space surrounded by gas.

Ben, fresh out the academy, is eager to get in on the action, but James has him staying on the radio. James gets close enough to Troy, but Troy pulls a gun on him. Ben sees this over the camera and sneaks out to help. He rides into the meet in a showy car with hydraulics and draws unwanted attention to himself. He threatens Troy by acting tough dancing only to drop his badge in front of the crook. Then within seconds a brief shootout occurs leading to a random plan ""B"" with Mayfield getting shot and Troy making his escape. James and Ben go after him, with Ben nearly getting himself run over, though James follows Troy long enough until Troy drives out of a parking garage and onto another car. James then captures Troy and removes a necklace he was wearing which was also a flash drive.Mayfield is later hospitalized, and at the hospital, James reprimands Ben for his decision since he got Mayfield injured in the chaos causing him to take a leave of absence due to his injury. Lt. Brooks assigns James to go to Miami and see who Troy was working for. Ben wants to go so that he can prove himself ready for detective work, but nobody believes in him, especially after the mess he just caused.At home, Ben begins to plan his wedding to Angela, but he clashes with the wedding planner Cori. He tries to assert himself, but gets knocked out by the ceiling fan. Later, as Angela tries to seduce Ben, he complains about not being able to go to Miami. Angela calls James and tries to get him to take Ben, not just for himself, but so she can have him out of her hair while the wedding is planned. James refuses, but then changes his mind when he thinks he can prove that Ben doesnt have what it takes to be a detective. He goes to their house and officially invites Ben to Miami. James and Ben drive down to Miami together.Ben starts his detective work by trying to blend in with the locals as they search for A.J. but Ben gets punished by homicide detective Maya Cruz for using her computer without permission. Later, James and Ben find the hacker, who tells them about a safe in a club that contains something important, but first they have to meet with someone there. The guys go to the club for work, but A.J. gets Ben to enjoy himself with an impromptu bachelor party. However, the man they are supposed to meet is also Popes hitman. A.J. causes a distraction and escapes while James engages in a brief shoot-out with the hitman. Afterward, the two are met by Maya at the crime scene. The safe turned out to be empty. Before the guys can leave, James realizes a bomb was planted under his car, which goes off and destroys his car.Ben realizes he kept A.J.s phone on him, so they find his girlfriend Tasha to get a lead on his whereabouts. Ben convinces Tasha to spill the beans when he shows her that hes been hooking up with other women and given them unique ringtones, while Tasha is left with the generic Apple ringtone. The guys locate A.J. once more and bring him in on the investigation. He reveals to the team that Pope is the real crook, despite him having a public image as an entrepreneur working alongside the new port commissioner Nunez. The team is at the home of Mayas friend/associate Alonso, whom Ben accidentally shoots after getting scared. Despite getting shot, Alonso backs up A.J.s word that Pope is a crook.James, Ben, and Maya go to a party hosted by Pope in his mansion. Maya distracts Pope by dancing with him while James and Ben gather info, and A.J. is their eyes and ears. While snooping around, Ben is attacked by Popes pet alligator, Marcus, in the backyard. After narrowly escaping from the jaws of Popes pet alligator, Ben reconnects with the team and they get their information, but Pope catches them and knows theyre cops, though he lets them go. The team uses their information to locate a group of shipping trucks that may be carrying Popes contraband. However, when they attempt to stop the trucks at the port, they discover that the trucks are empty. Hernandez scolds the team, as Pope shows up and acts angry for what the team did. Nunez then shows up and calls Hernandez over. Brooks is informed of the screw-up and orders James to be suspended and for Ben to be fired.The team goes to a bar to think about what they did wrong. Maya then questions as to why Nunez would have shown up so fast at the port. A.J. mentions that Nunezs name was on a list of guys on Popes payroll. James realizes that Pope knew he would have gotten caught, so he had a decoy in the trucks, and the real contraband items are being brought in somewhere else at the port. James, Maya, and A.J. go after Pope, but Maya handcuffs Ben to a pole after James says he wants Ben to stay so he can take care of Angela. However, Ben breaks free and goes to Alonsos house to get the cuffs off.James, Maya, and A.J. are at the port in the morning to catch Pope.

Pope rises and shoots again, but James uses Ben as a human shield, and Maya shoots Pope once more for good measure, killing him and ending the gun battle once and for all.James and Ben are off the hook for taking down Pope and Nunez and being commended for their services. They drive home in a yellow Lamborghini that Maya got for them to drive back to Atlanta for the wedding, with James asking Maya to be his date. Ben and Angela are married and are ready to go off on a boat ride, but Ben wants James to make a speech.

478,479,Rio 2,2014,/wiki/Rio_2,"Spixs Macaws Blu and Jewel and their three children—Bia, Carla, and Tiago—are living happily in the city until Jewel realizes that her children are becoming more like humans. Meanwhile, Blus former owner, Linda Gunderson and her ornithologist husband, Tulio are on an expedition in the Amazon and, after a fall down a waterfall, discover a quick-flying Spixs macaw that loses one of its feathers. When word gets out about this through television, Jewel believes that they should go to the Amazon to help find the blue macaws. While the kids are ecstatic, Blu is uncertain, but he is pressured into going along. Rafael, Nico and Pedro decide to come along. Luiz attempts to follow but fails. Blu brings a fanny pack full of supplies, one of which he uses mostly is a GPS, much to Jewels displeasure.Meanwhile, the leader of a group in a line of illegal logging named Big Boss, discovers Linda and Tulios expedition to find the macaws and orders his henchmen to hunt them down to avoid disruptions to their work. Also, Blu and Jewels old nemesis, Nigel the cockatoo, has survived the plane crash from the first film, but he is now unable to fly and is working as a fortune teller/con artist. When he sees Blu and his family flying overhead, he immediately decides to seek revenge on them. He enlists two minions to help him in his plans; a silent anteater named Charlie and a poison dart frog named Gabi, who is in love with Nigel. Blu and his family use a boat to get to the jungle (with Nigels first plan of revenge being inadvertently foiled by Charlie); and when they arrive, they find nothing. However, they are eventually taken to a flock of blue macaws that are hiding in a secret paradise land. There, they meet Jewels stern long-lost father, Eduardo, his older sister Mimi, and Jewels childhood friend, Roberto. Eduardo seems unimpressed with Blus domesticated human behavior.While searching for the macaws, Linda and Tulio are eventually trapped by the loggers. Meanwhile, Blu does his best to fit in with the flock, as his family and friends are doing, although the flock (especially Eduardo) are against humans and all things human. Meanwhile, a disguised Nigel plans to kill Blu at the new Carnival show after landing in an audition hosted by Rafael, Nico, Pedro, and Carla. When Blu tries to pick a Brazilian nut for Jewel, he accidentally tries to get it in the territory of the Spix macaws enemies, the scarlet macaws, led by the hostile Felipe. Blu inadvertently causes war between the two tribes for food when he accidentally hits Felipe with a twig. The war turns out to be just like football (soccer), and Blu accidentally costs the flock the food when he scores an own goal.Blu visits Tulio and Lindas site, where he discovers that it has been majorly disturbed. After discovering the loggers are destroying the jungle, Blu sends Roberto (who followed Blu) to warn the flock as he saves Linda and Tulio. Blu persuades the macaws to defend their homes, and they easily outmatch the loggers with help from the scarlet macaws and the other animals. Big Boss tries to blow up the trees as a back-up plan, but Blu steals the lit dynamite. Nigel goes after Blu, and reveals himself as they are falling down when he tugs on the dynamite.After the dynamite goes off, Blu and Nigel engage in a battle while tangled in vines. Gabi and Charlie try to help Nigel by shooting Blu with a dart that has Gabis poison on it, but it accidentally hits Nigel, who gives a Shakespearean death speech before seemingly dying.Gabi, in a Romeo and Juliet-style, tries to commit suicide by drinking her own poison and the pair are seemingly dead. However, Bia reveals that Gabi isnt poisonous at all (she was lied to by her parents that she was). Nigel tries to attack Blu one last time, but Gabi showers Nigel with affection against his will. Meanwhile, Big Boss is eaten by a boa constrictor he encountered.With the flock now under Linda and Tulios protection, Blu and Jewel decide to live in the Amazon with their kids and friends, though still agreeing to visit Rio in the summer. Meanwhile, Nigel and Gabi are captured by Tulio, and are both sent back to Rio.

Three hundred years later, Jack, as the young Spirit of Winter, enjoys delivering snow days to school kids, but resents that they do not believe in him. At the North Pole, the Man in the Moon warns Nicholas St. North that Pitch Black is threatening the children of the world with his nightmares. He calls E. Aster Bunnymund, Sandy, and Tooth, to arms. They are then told that Jack Frost has been chosen to be a new Guardian.Visiting Tooths world, Jack learns that each and every baby tooth contains childhood memories of the children who lost it, Jacks teeth included. However, Pitch raids Tooths home, kidnapping all of her subordinate tooth fairies except Baby Tooth and stealing all the teeth, thus preventing Tooth from sharing Jacks memories and weakening childrens belief in Tooth. In order to thwart Pitchs plan, the group decides to collect childrens teeth. During their journey, a quarrel between North and Bunnymund awakens a boy, Jamie. Since he still believes, he can see everybody except for Jack. Pitchs nightmares then attack, provoking Sandy as the Guardian of Dreams. Jack tries to intervene, but Sandy is overwhelmed and killed by Pitch.As Easter approaches, the dejected Guardians gather in Bunnymunds home. With the unexpected aid of Jamies little sister, Sophie, they begin the process of painting eggs for Easter. After Jack takes Sophie home, he is lured to Pitchs lair by a voice. Pitch taunts him with his memories and fear of non-belief, distracting him long enough for Pitch to destroy the eggs, causing children to stop believing in Easter and Bunnymund. Losing his trust in the Guardians, a shameful Jack isolates himself in Antarctica, where Pitch tries to convince him to join his side. When Jack refuses, Pitch threatens to kill Baby Tooth unless Jack gives him his staff, the source of his magic. He agrees, but Pitch breaks Jacks staff and throws him down a chasm. Unlocking his memories, he learns that he was a mortal teenager who fell into ice while saving his younger sister. Inspired, Jack repairs his staff and returns to the lair to rescue the kidnapped baby fairies.Due to Pitch, every child in the world except Jamie disbelieves, drastically weakening the Guardians. Finding Jamies belief wavering, Jack makes it snow in his room, renewing Jamies belief and letting him see Jack. Jack and Jamie gather the boys friends, whose renewed belief bolsters their fight against Pitch. Pitch threatens them, but their dreams prove stronger than his nightmares, resulting in Sandys resurrection. Defeated and disbelieved in, Pitch tries to retreat, but his nightmares, sensing his own fears, turn on him and trap him in his lair.

480,481,Rise of the Planet of the Apes,2011,/wiki/Rise_of_the_Planet_of_the_Apes,"Will Rodman, a scientist at the San Francisco biotech company Gen-Sys, is testing the viral-based drug ALZ-112 on chimpanzees to find a cure for Alzheimers disease. ALZ-112 is given to a chimp named Bright Eyes, greatly increasing her intelligence. But then, during Wills presentation for the drug, Bright Eyes is forced from her cage, goes on a rampage, and is shot to death. Wills boss Steven Jacobs terminates the project and has the chimps slaughtered. However, Wills assistant Robert Franklin discovers that the reason for Bright Eyes rampage was that she had recently given birth to an infant chimp. Will reluctantly agrees to take in the chimp, who is named Caesar. Will learns that Caesar has inherited his mothers intelligence and decides to raise him. Three years later, Will introduces Caesar to the redwood forest at Muir Woods National Monument. Meanwhile, Will treats his dementia-suffering father Charles with ALZ-112, which seems to restore his cognitive ability.Five years later, when Caesar reaches adolescence and sees a dog on a leash like his own, he questions his identity and learns of his origins from Will. Meanwhile, Charless condition returns as he becomes resistant to ALZ-112. Caesar injures an aggressive neighbor, Douglas Hunsiker, while defending a confused Charles from him. As a result, he is placed in a primate shelter where he is tormented by a chimp named Rocket and the chief guard, Dodge Landon, but also where he befriends an orangutan named Maurice who came from a circus. Caesar learns how to unlock his cage, gaining free access to the common area. With the assistance of a gorilla named Buck, he confronts the sanctuarys alpha, Rocket and claims that position. Meanwhile, Jacobs clears development of a more powerful, gaseous version of the drug – ALZ-113 – when Will tells him it can also improve intelligence. Will takes the drug home to try to save his father, but Charles declines further treatment and dies overnight.After attempting to test the drug on a scarred bonobo test subject named Koba, Franklin becomes exposed to ALZ-113 and becomes ill. Attempting to warn Will at his home, he sneezes blood onto Hunsiker and is later discovered dead. Will attempts to reclaim Caesar, but the chimp refuses to go home with him so he could look after the other apes. Instead, he escapes from the facility and returns to Wills house, where he takes canisters of the ALZ-113. Upon returning, Caesar releases the gas and allows it to enhance the intelligence of the other apes. When Dodge attempts to get him back into his cage, Caesar speaks for the first time, yelling ""No!"" and gets in a fight which inadvertently leads to Dodges death. The apes flee the facility, releasing Koba and the remaining apes from Gen-Sys, and free more apes from the San Francisco Zoo on the way.A battle ensues as the ape army fights their way past a police blockade on the Golden Gate Bridge to escape into the redwood forest. Buck sacrifices himself to save Caesar by jumping into the helicopter in which Jacobs is riding. The helicopter crashes onto the bridge, trapping Jacobs in the wreckage. While Caesar ignores Jacobs pledges for help, he instead allows Koba to seize his chance for revenge and sends Jacobs falling to his death in the bay below.As the apes find their way into the forest, Will catches up to them in a stolen police car and warns Caesar that the humans will hunt them down, and begs him to return home. In response, Caesar hugs him and says that, ""Caesar is home"". Will, realizing that this is indeed their last goodbye, respects Caesars wishes. The apes embrace their new lifestyle in the forest.In a mid-credits scene, an infected Hunsiker leaves his house for work as an airline pilot, arriving at San Francisco International Airport for his flight to Paris.

Will takes the drug home to try to save his father, but Charles declines further treatment and dies overnight.After attempting to test the drug on a scarred bonobo test subject named Koba, Franklin becomes exposed to ALZ-113 and becomes ill. Attempting to warn Will at his home, he sneezes blood onto Hunsiker and is later discovered dead. Will attempts to reclaim Caesar, but the chimp refuses to go home with him so he could look after the other apes. Instead, he escapes from the facility and returns to Wills house, where he takes canisters of the ALZ-113. Upon returning, Caesar releases the gas and allows it to enhance the intelligence of the other apes. When Dodge attempts to get him back into his cage, Caesar speaks for the first time, yelling ""No!"" and gets in a fight which inadvertently leads to Dodges death. The apes flee the facility, releasing Koba and the remaining apes from Gen-Sys, and free more apes from the San Francisco Zoo on the way.A battle ensues as the ape army fights their way past a police blockade on the Golden Gate Bridge to escape into the redwood forest. Buck sacrifices himself to save Caesar by jumping into the helicopter in which Jacobs is riding. The helicopter crashes onto the bridge, trapping Jacobs in the wreckage. While Caesar ignores Jacobs pledges for help, he instead allows Koba to seize his chance for revenge and sends Jacobs falling to his death in the bay below.As the apes find their way into the forest, Will catches up to them in a stolen police car and warns Caesar that the humans will hunt them down, and begs him to return home. In response, Caesar hugs him and says that, ""Caesar is home"". Will, realizing that this is indeed their last goodbye, respects Caesars wishes. The apes embrace their new lifestyle in the forest.In a mid-credits scene, an infected Hunsiker leaves his house for work as an airline pilot, arriving at San Francisco International Airport for his flight to Paris.

482,483,Robin Hood,2010,/wiki/Robin_Hood_(2010_film),"In the year 1199, Robin Longstride (Russell Crowe) serves as a common archer in the army of King Richard the Lionheart (Danny Huston). A veteran of Richards crusade, he now takes part in the siege of Chalus Castle. Disillusioned and war-weary, he gives a frank but unflattering appraisal of the Kings conduct when the King asks his opinion, and Robin and his comrades—archers Allan ADayle (Alan Doyle) and Will Scarlett (Scott Grimes) and soldier Little John (Kevin Durand)—find themselves in the stocks.When the King is slain during an attack on the castle, Robin and his men decide to free themselves and desert. They come across an ambush of the English royal guard by Godfrey (Mark Strong), an English knight who has conspired with King Philip of France to assassinate King Richard. After chasing Godfrey away, Robin decides to take advantage of the situation by having his men impersonate the dead English knights to return to England. Before they depart to sail across the Channel, Robin promises one of the dying knights, Sir Robert Loxley (Douglas Hodge), to return his sword to his father in Nottingham.Awaking to find his party in the Thames estuary, Robin must continue to assume the identity of Loxley to inform the royal family of King Richards death. He witnesses the coronation of King John (Oscar Isaac), who orders the collection of harsh new taxes and dispatches Godfrey to the North to do so—unaware that Godfrey will instead use French troops to stir up unrest and to prepare for King Philip to invade England.Robin and his companions head to Nottingham, where Loxleys elderly and blind father, Sir Walter (Max von Sydow), asks him to continue impersonating his son to prevent the Crown from seizing the Loxley family lands. Loxleys widow, Lady Marian (Cate Blanchett), is initially cold toward Robin, but warms to him when he and his men merrily recover tithed grain for the townsfolk to plant.Godfreys actions incite the northern barons, who march to meet King John. Speaking now for Sir Walter, Robin proposes that King John agree to a charter of rights to ensure the rights of every Englishman and to unite his country. Having realized Godfreys deception, and knowing he must meet the French invasion with an army, the King agrees. Meanwhile, French marauders plunder Nottingham. Robin and the northern barons arrive to stop Godfreys men, but not before Godfrey has slain the blind Sir Walter.As the main French expeditionary force begins its invasion of England on a beach below the cliffs of Dover, Robin leads the now united English army against them. In the midst of the battle, Robin duels with Godfrey, who attempts to kill Marion and flees until Robin finally kills him with an arrow from afar. King Philip realizes that his plan to divide England has failed and calls off his invasion. When King John sees the French surrendering to Robin instead of to himself, he senses a threat to his power. In London, King John reneges on his promise to sign the charter and declares Robin an outlaw to be hunted throughout the kingdom. The Sheriff of Nottingham (Matthew Macfadyen) announces the decree, and Robin and his men flee to Sherwood Forest with the orphans of Nottingham. Marion narrates their new life in the greenwood, noting that they live in equality as they right the many wrongs in the kingdom of King John.

483,484,RoboCop,2014,/wiki/RoboCop_(2014_film),"In 2028, multinational conglomerate OmniCorp revolutionizes warfare with the introduction of robotic peacekeepers capable of maintaining law and order in hot spots such as Vietnam, Iraq, Afghanistan, and Iran. Led by CEO Raymond Sellars, the company moves to market its technology to domestic law enforcement, but the passage of the Dreyfus Act, forbidding deployment of drones in the United States, prevents this. Aware that most Americans oppose the use of military systems in their communities, Sellars asks Dr. Dennett Norton and his research team to create an alternative. The result is a proposal for a cyborg police officer. However, Norton informs Sellars that only someone who is stable enough to handle being a cyborg can be turned into one, and some candidates are rejected.A Detroit police detective, Alex Murphy, is chosen after he is critically injured in a car bomb explosion arranged by crime boss Antoine Vallon in revenge for Murphys investigation into his activities. Norton persuades Murphys wife Clara to sign off on the procedure. Upon waking up and realizing the extent of his transformation, Murphy flies into a rage and escapes from the lab, but Norton shuts him down and brings him back to the lab. As Norton reveals to Murphy that the only remnants of his human body are most of his head (excluding parts of the brain), his respiratory organs, his heart, and his right hand, Murphy is disgusted, and asks for euthanasia. Norton reminds Murphy about his wifes and sons patience, and convinces him to live on. During combat training with trainer Rick Mattox, Murphy proves unable to compete with the standard OmniCorp drones in efficiency. Norton alters his programming to make him more efficient by having drone programming take over his actions, but make him think they are his.  This increases his efficiency dramatically, but also makes him less empathetic due to his human nature being bypassed.Shortly before he is to be publicly unveiled, Murphy has an emotional breakdown, forcing Norton to remove his emotions. During the ceremony, RoboCop identifies and apprehends a criminal in the crowd. He goes on to reduce crime in Detroit dramatically, simultaneously increasing public support for repealing the Dreyfus Act. Aware that Clara has begun to ask questions, Sellars orders Norton to keep her away from her husband.Clara nevertheless manages to confront RoboCop, telling him of their son Davids nightmares. The experience leads Murphy to override his programming and access the previously sealed files on his attempted murder. From them, he learns his son was devastated after witnessing the explosion. Murphy pursues Vallons gang to exact revenge. He takes heavy damage from their armor-piercing weapons, but manages to kill the boss and his men. Murphy returns to the station and joins with his old partner, Jack Lewis, to confront the two corrupt cops who betrayed him to Vallon, shooting one and tazing the other. Learning that the Chief of Police was also involved, Murphy moves to arrest her, but is remotely shut down by Mattox.With the help of Pat Novak, a pro-OmniCorp talk show host, Sellars uses the incident to get the Dreyfus Act repealed. Clara goes to the press and angrily demands to see her husband. Fearful of being exposed, Sellars orders Mattox to destroy RoboCop while hes being repaired, while he lies to Clara, saying that Alex died. Norton is able to reach him first and reveals the truth. RoboCop narrowly escapes from the building just as it undergoes lockdown.Murphy returns and storms the building, fighting his way through the ED-209 drones sent to stop him, while Lewis and his fellow police arrive to hold off the rest of OmniCorps forces. Mattox subdues Murphy and prepares to finish him off, but is killed by Lewis. Murphy then makes his way to the roof where Sellars is waiting for a helicopter with Clara and David as hostages. Murphys programming initially prevents him from arresting Sellars, but he overcomes it long enough to kill Sellars when Sellars overconfidently continues to taunt him.OmniCorps parent company, OCP, shuts down the project. The President vetoes the repeal of the Dreyfus Act based on the testimony of Norton, to Novaks anger. Murphys body is rebuilt in Nortons laboratory, and he waits for Clara and David, who are coming to visit him.",120000000,"[{""id"": 28, ""name"": ""Action""}, {""id"": 878, ""name"": ""Science Fiction""}]",http://www.robocop.com,97020,"[{""id"": 679, ""name"": ""cyborg""}, {""id"": 2964, ""name"": ""future""}, {""id"": 4565, ""name"": ""dystopia""}, {""id"": 6149, ""name"": ""police""}, {""id"": 9714, ""name"": ""remake""}, {""id"": 14819, ""name"": ""violence""}, {""id"": 18021, ""name"": ""detroit""}]",en,"In RoboCop, the year is 2028 and multinational conglomerate OmniCorp is at the center of robot technology.

487,488,Safe House,2012,/wiki/Safe_House_(2012_film),"In Cape Town, South Africa, ex-CIA NOC operative turned international criminal Tobin Frost (Denzel Washington)  acquires a data storage device from rogue MI6 agent Alec Wade (Liam Cunningham). After, the pair is attacked by a team of mercenaries led by Vargas (Fares Fares), Wade is killed and Frost is cornered by the gunmen, leaving him no choice but to surrender to the American consulate.Frost is transferred to a local safe house maintained by ""housekeeper"" Matt Weston (Ryan Reynolds), a young agent on his first low-level CIA posting. The CIA sends in a team led by veteran agent Daniel Kiefer (Robert Patrick) to interrogate Frost and bring him back to the US. Weston watches uneasily as Kiefer and his men waterboard Frost. When the power to the safe house is cut, the CIA team realise that they are in grave danger. Vargas and a heavily armed group attack the safe house, killing Kiefer and his team. Weston escapes, taking Frost as his charge. Weston makes contact with his superior, David Barlow (Brendan Gleeson), at CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, along with Catherine Linklater (Vera Farmiga), the operative in charge of Frosts interrogation and Kiefers superior, and CIA Deputy Director Harlan Whitford (Sam Shepard), who is overseeing the operation. Linklater orders Weston to lay low and await further instructions.Frost immediately begins to manipulate Weston as they go into hiding, insisting that someone within the CIA gave away their location to the mercenaries and that Weston will be the one forced to take the fall if things go wrong, warning him to be wary of the words ""Well take it from here"". Weston hides out with Frost and calls his girlfriend Ana Moreau (Nora Arnezeder), a French medical resident who does not know that he works for the CIA, and tells her to leave the house. Barlow later tells Weston to go to Cape Town Stadium to retrieve a GPS device with the location of another nearby safe house. He retrieves the GPS at the stadium, but Frost creates a diversion and gets away by disguising himself as a policeman. Weston, detained by the police, escapes but is forced to fire at police when they attempt to arrest him again. Weston goes to recapture Frost but Frost disarms him and aims as if to kill, only to fire next to Westons head and say ""I only kill professionals"".Weston contacts Langley and informs Barlow and the others of Frosts escape. Linklater orders him to visit the nearest American embassy for debriefing after hearing that Weston fired at the police. When Whitford tells him ""Well take it from here."", Weston decides to pursue Frost himself. He meets with Ana and reveals that he is a CIA agent, telling her to return to Paris for her safety.Linklater and Barlow are instructed to go to South Africa in order to pursue Frost. En route, Linklater suggests that Weston has joined Frost, which Barlow denies. Weston tracks Frost to a shantytown in Langa, where Frost is meeting Nicaraguan Carlos Villar (Rubén Blades), an old contact and document forger. Vargas and his team attack again, killing Villar along with his wife, but Frost eludes him and his men with Westons help. Weston brutally interrogates one of Vargas wounded mercenaries, who reveals that Vargas is working for the CIA, which is seeking to retrieve the storage device Frost received from Wade.As they bandage their wounds, Frost tells the story of how he was forced to kill an air traffic controller while on a mission, having been told he was helping smuggle weapons. He later learned of the mans innocence, and that he was simply part of a plot to assassinate a whistle-blower who would expose wetwork committed by the CIA. Frost tells Weston he continued his career and eventually went rogue simply because he was good at it, and urges Weston to not kill innocent people. Weston takes Frost to the new safe house, where Weston keeps the housekeeper, Keller (Joel Kinnaman) at gunpoint, believing he no longer knows if he can trust the CIA.Keller attacks Weston, and after a brutal struggle, Weston breaks Kellers neck, but he is badly wounded in the fight. Frost reveals the device contains Israeli intelligence which includes details of corrupt officials and secret money transfers involving American CIA, British MI6, and other intelligence agencies; Weston recognises the reference to the Mossad because the CIA accused Frost of selling secrets to them before he became a rogue agent. Frost leaves Weston, who passes out from his wounds. Meanwhile, Linklater arrives in South Africa and informs Barlow of the devices existence, but not its contents. Barlow then kills her and travels to the safe house where he reveals that he is Vargas employer. He confirms that the file contains incriminating evidence against him, and encourages Weston to lie about what has happened. Frost returns and kills Vargas and his men but is shot by Barlow. Weston then shoots Barlow in the chest, killing him. Frost gives Weston the file and tells Weston he is better than him before he dies from his injuries.Back in the United States, Weston meets with Director Whitford, who informs Weston that unflattering facts about the CIA must be removed from his report, but that he will be promoted. He asks Weston about the files location but Weston denies having been told about it by Frost. Whitford states that whoever has those files will have many enemies. Weston assures Whitford that he will ""take it from here"", visibly shaking Whitford, and leaves. He leaks the files to the media, incriminating personnel from many intelligence agencies, including Whitford. Later, Weston has tracked Ana in Paris. He sends a note to her as she sits in a cafe across the street.

488,489,Salt,2010,/wiki/Salt_(2010_film),"Evelyn Salt (Angelina Jolie) is being tortured in a prison in North Korea on suspicion of being an American spy. Her boyfriend, arachnologist Mike Krause (August Diehl), generates so much publicity about Salts imprisonment that the CIA is forced to arrange a prisoner exchange, despite the agencys policy against it. Salts CIA colleague Ted Winter (Liev Schreiber) greets Salt at the border. As they drive away, Mike proposes marriage, despite Salts admission to Mike that she is in fact a CIA operative.Two years later, on Salt and Mikes wedding anniversary, a Russian defector named Oleg Vasilyevich Orlov (Daniel Olbrychski) walks into Salts office. Salt interrogates him, with Winter and CIA counterintelligence officer Darryl Peabody (Chiwetel Ejiofor) observing. Orlov claims that, on ""Day X"", highly trained Russian sleeper agents known as ""KAs"" will destroy the U.S. Orlov tells them that Agent ""KA-12"" will assassinate Russian president Boris Matveyev (Olek Krupa) at the funeral of the American Vice President. Orlov reveals that KA-12 is named Evelyn Salt, and lie detectors confirm his entire story. Peabody orders Salt be detained, while Orlov kills two agents and escapes. In the confusion, Salt is able to escape from the building, running barefoot through the street. While the CIA is searching for her, Salt discovers that her husband was kidnapped.A while later at the funeral, Salt appears to succeed in killing President Matveyev, and then surrenders herself. Matveyev is declared dead. Salt escapes again and heads to a barge where Orlov is hiding with other sleeper agents. In a series of flashbacks, Salt recalls growing up in the Soviet Union and being trained with other children. On the barge, Orlov welcomes her back and has Mike killed in front of her. When Salt shows no reaction, Orlov is convinced she is loyal and begins briefing her on her next mission. She is to rendezvous with another KA who will help her assassinate the American president. She kills Orlov and the other agents before leaving. She then meets with KA Shnaider (Corey Stoll), who uses his cover as a Czech NATO liaison to get Salt into the White House. Once inside, Shnaider launches a suicide attack to force agents to move the President (Hunt Block) to an underground bunker, accompanied by Winter. Salt follows them and manages to enter the bunker before it is sealed.The U.S. President learns that Russia has mobilized its nuclear arsenal in response to their presidents death. He orders American nuclear weapons readied in response. CIA Agent Winter suddenly kills everyone except the President and introduces himself as Nikolai Tarkovsky, another member of the KA. Winter incapacitates the President and begins aiming nuclear missiles at Mecca and Tehran to incite a billion Muslims against the United States. Salt tries to persuade Winter to let her inside the sealed room, but then he sees a television report saying President Matveyev is alive and well; Salt had used spider venom to cause a simulated death of Matveyev. Winter refuses her entry and reveals that Mikes kidnapping and murder and her blown cover were all his idea. Winter plans to place full blame for the nuclear attacks on Salt. Salt breaks into the room before he can launch the missiles. The two wrestle for control of the nuclear football, with Salt aborting the missile strikes before being captured.As Salt is being led out in chains, Winter grabs a pair of scissors, ready to attack her or to defend himself if necessary. She unexpectedly hooks her chain around Winters neck and jumps over the stair railing, strangling him to death. On the helicopter ride to be interrogated, Peabody questions her. Salt explains that she killed Winter because he orchestrated the death of her husband, and promises to hunt down the remaining KA agents if freed. Peabody is convinced after receiving a text that Salts fingerprints were found on the barge where the sleeper agents were killed, supporting her story. Salt is allowed to escape, jumping out of the helicopter into the river below and escaping into the woods.In an alternate ending, Salt, disguised as a nun, arrives at the building where she was trained as a child in the former Soviet Union. She confronts Orlov in his office, telling him that she came to inform him that shes ""free"". The two then engage in a brief fight, where Orlov is then shot by Salt multiple times; she is then seen by the water as she pushes Orlov, whose is tied to a large rock, into the water, and watches him drown.

489,490,Sanctum,2011,/wiki/Sanctum_(film),"Seventeen-year-old Joshua ""Josh"" McGuire (Rhys Wakefield), expedition bank-roller Carl Hurley (Ioan Gruffudd) and his girlfriend, Victoria ""Vic"" Elaine (Alice Parkinson), travel to the Esaala Cave, an underwater cave exploration site in Papua New Guinea. Joshs father, Frank (Richard Roxburgh), a master diver, has already established a forward base camp at a lower level inside the cave, where the team has been exploring for weeks. As Josh voices his disdain for his father and his opinions about cave exploration, the team below prepares to dive into an unexplored area of the system.While exploring the entrance to the new system, Judes (Allison Cratchley) experiences a problem with her air tank hose. She loses use of her air mask forcing Frank to buddy breathe. After a few exchanges, Judes panics and tries to keep the mask on, but Frank forces the mask off of her knowing he will not have enough air otherwise to make it back to the team. As Judes drowns, Josh watches on a monitor at ""forward camp"" and presumes the worst of his father. In a struggle to determine who truly was responsible for her death, it is revealed by Frank that Judes had dived in an exhausted state since they previously had to retrieve the extra bailout tanks, a task Josh didnt do. Meanwhile, their above-ground crew realizes that a very big storm is preparing to hit their location sooner than anticipated. They attempt to warn the team below, but are unsuccessful. Josh expresses his desire to return to the surface and with communications down and an uncertain expedition in front of them, team leader Frank agrees to have his son return to the surface with a buddy climber ahead of them.While Josh climbs back towards the surface with Luko, Liz, and J.D, water begins rushing in from their exit. The storm they were trying to avoid had turned into a cyclone causing flash floods that begin to fill the cave. As J.D. and Liz make their way up through ""the elevator"" (an area leading up to the main entrance of the cave), Josh is unable to leave his father and the dive team behind to their doom and turns back, accompanied by Luko. As they are making their way back to ""forward camp"" they discover that Frank and the team have already evacuated their camp and are assisting Victoria as she climbs her way up and out of the cavern. Josh leaps in to help, strapping a rope around a nearby boulder and forming a belay for the team to escape.  Unfortunately, the boulder begins to give way leaving Josh to hold Victorias line and Luko to hold back the boulder. The water rushes through and forces Victoria and Josh to fall back down into the now flooded base camp. Luko is severely injured when the boulder breaks loose, sealing the shaft and throwing him back down into the cavern. He is swept into an underwater tunnel before the team can reach him. The team decides to use the unexplored tunnel as an escape route from the rapidly flooding cavern. Victoria, panicked and anxious, refuses to wear Judes old wetsuit and is given a quick tutorial on how to dive. Before the team can leave, a severely injured and mutilated Luko surfaces in the cavern. Seeing that his friend is in great pain and near death, Frank mercifully drowns him.The team presses on and makes it through to the other side of the system. Without a wetsuit, Victoria suffers severely from the cold water. Meanwhile, George - an experienced, veteran diver - has become ill due to the dive and is dying unbeknownst to the rest of the team. After a short rest, the team continues through the system following the flow of water out towards the sea. George realizes that he cannot continue and after sharing a few words with Josh relieves himself of his pack and hides himself so as not to burden the rest of the team.As the team marches on they arrive at a seemingly dead end. A great hole in the bottom of the cave separates them from the other side of their path. Josh uses his climbing expertise to fish a line across and begins to transfer their gear and each other. As Victoria begins to make her way across she catches her hair in her rope gear she is hung on and loses her grip, leaving her hair as the only thing holding her weight. Using her knife, she attempts to cut away the hair, but severs her rope and falls to her death. At the sight of Victorias death, Carl becomes psychotic. In a fit of panic, he steals the last remaining rebreather and disappears into the tunnel. Josh and Frank, however, find another way out through a crevasse in the cavern. The tunnel leads them to a sunlit cavern where an unidentified WWII Japanese tank collapsed through the surface years ago. Unfortunately the hole in the middle of the roof where the tank fell is the only opening and they are unable to climb out. They spend the rest of the day there and proceed back into the cave by night.A little later they discover Carl who has gone completely insane and found Victorias corpse. Carl attempts to murder Frank but Josh separates the two and temporarily disables Carl. Frank, however, has been gravely injured having fallen on a stalagmite which punctured his back. When Carl wakes, the gravity of his actions is realized and he solemnly disappears into the tunnel. In immense pain, Frank requests that Josh drown him. Josh reluctantly does so, and swims into the tunnel. A short distance in, he encounters Carl, who has already drowned looking for the exit. Just as he begins to lose hope, Josh discovers a way out through the cave to open ocean.

490,491,Sausage Party,2016,/wiki/Sausage_Party,"A supermarket called Shopwells is filled with anthropomorphic grocery items that believe that the human shoppers are gods, who take groceries they have purchased to a utopia known as the Great Beyond. Among the groceries in the store is a sausage named Frank, who dreams of living in the Great Beyond with his hot dog bun girlfriend Brenda and of finally consummating their relationship.Frank and Brendas packages are chosen by a woman named Camille Toh to leave Shopwells. A returned jar of Bickles Honey Mustard tries to warn the groceries that the Great Beyond is a lie; nobody listens except for Frank. Honey Mustard tells Frank to seek out a bottle of liquor named Firewater, and then commits suicide by falling on the store floor. This creates an accidental cart collision that causes Frank, Brenda and several groceries to fall out of the cart, including an aggressive douche whose nozzle is bent on impact. Douche swears revenge against Frank and Brenda.Seeking to verify Honey Mustards warning, Frank leads Brenda to the stores liquor aisle. There, as he smokes marijuana from a kazoo pipe, he learns from Firewater that he and other non-perishable foods invented the story of the Great Beyond as a noble lie to assuage past foods fears of being eaten by shoppers. Frank, vowing to reveal the truth to the groceries, is encouraged to travel beyond the stores freezer section to find proof. Meanwhile, Franks friends Carl and Barry are horrified as they witness the brutal murder of other purchased foods being cooked and eaten by Camille. Carl is sliced in half, but Barry escapes the house and encounters a human drug addict, who injects himself with bath salts and becomes able to communicate with his groceries. While attempting to cook Barry, the addict is decapitated in a freak domestic accident.After Frank separates from his friends, who disapprove of his skepticism of the Great Beyond, he discovers a cookbook behind the freezer section and reveals its contents to the rest of Shopwells groceries. Initially panicking, the groceries choose not to believe Frank out of fear of losing their sense of purpose. Barry and the groceries from the addicts home return to the store with his severed head, proving that the humans are not gods, but are mortal. The groceries drug the human shoppers and employees using toothpicks laced with bath salts, and several humans are gruesomely killed in the ensuing battle. Douche takes control of Darren, the store manager, by inserting himself into his anus and yanking on his scrotum to puppeteer his actions, but Barry and the other foods defeat them with an improvised rocket. The groceries celebrate their victory with a store-wide orgy.Afterwards, the gang meets Firewater and Gum, a Stephen Hawking-esque wad of chewing gum. They have had a psychedelic experience and discovered that their world is not real, and they are merely cartoons voiced by famous actors in another dimension.

Chon, a former Navy SEAL, smuggled the seeds for the plants out of Afghanistan. Ben, a University of California, Berkeley graduate in business and botany, cultivates the marijuana. The seeds yield a particularly potent strain, which develops a wide customer base. Chon and Ben become wealthy, and Ben devotes time and money to charity work in Africa and Asia. They are both openly in a relationship with Ophelia Sage (Blake Lively).The trio receives a video from Mexican drug-cartel enforcer Miguel ""Lado"" Arroyo (Benicio del Toro) of severed heads and a chainsaw, and Arroyo demands a meeting at which the cartel offers a partnership. Although Chon and Ben offer to hand over their network and get out of the business, the cartel wants their expertise and insists on a partnership. Chon and Ben make plans with Ophelia to go to Indonesia for a year, not telling her that they are fleeing the cartel. They speak to corrupt DEA agent Dennis Cain (John Travolta), who is on the take from them and who urges them to join the cartel. Ophelia is kidnapped by Lados gang; Chon and Ben are notified of the kidnapping by a video call from cartel leader Elena Sánchez (Salma Hayek), who threatens to harm Ophelia if they decline the partnership.They discuss the situation with Dennis, who tells them that Elena is facing the loss of her political connections in Mexico (foiling her efforts to move into the US). Since she has already lost most of her family, Dennis says that he has nothing on her that can help them. Chon stabs Dennis in the hand and demands DEA intelligence so they can attack Elena. With help from Chons Navy SEAL friends, he and Ben attack a cartel money convoy and kill seven of Elenas men.Ophelia, held in horrible conditions, demands to speak to whoever is in charge.

Chon and Ben frame high-ranking cartel member Alex (Demián Bichir) as an agent of Elenas rival, El Azul. With Dennis help, they falsify evidence and give it to Lado. Lado tortures Alex to force a confession. After Alex confesses, Lado covers him with petrol and forces Ben to ignite the petrol; Ophelia is forced to watch. Lado double-crosses Elena and begins working with El Azul.Ben and Chon pay Dennis $3 million for information about Elenas daughter, Magda (Sandra Echeverria), and the name of his informant in Elenas cartel. They kidnap Magda and video-call Elena to establish that they are now in control. With Elena at their mercy, they arrange a desert meeting to exchange Ophelia and Magda at which snipers from both sides are in position. Elena asks who revealed her daughters location, and Chon tells her it was Lado. She tries to kill Lado, but he shoots her first; a firefight erupts, and Chon is shot several times. Lado is shot in the back by Ben, but shoots him in the neck before Ophelia kills him. Ben is mortally wounded, and Chon injects him, Ophelia and himself with a fatal overdose so they can die together.Ophelia wakes from a nightmare. At the meeting, Lado steals Elenas car and escapes as Dennis leads DEA agents to the scene. Everyone but Lado and Magda are arrested. Because Ben has incriminating information about Dennis, Dennis identifies Ben and Chon as his informants in the cartel and they are released. Elena is sentenced to thirty years in prison, and El Azul and Lado create a new cartel called the Azulados. Ben, Chon and Ophelia leave the country and live in a beachside hut, possibly in Indonesia.

492,493,Saw VI,2010,/wiki/Saw_VI,"Two predatory lenders wake up in a room with a caged-in scale, wearing head harnesses with screws aimed at their temples, and the one who sets more flesh weight on their scale will survive. The overweight Eddie cuts fat from his torso, but Simone chops off her arm, and Eddie is killed when the timer expires. As he reviews the games footage, Detective Lieutenant Mark Hoffman is called over by FBI Agent Dan Erickson, who found Agent Peter Strahms fingerprints at the scene. Also present is Lindsey Perez, whose survival was covered up by Erickson for her protection. They learn from Dr. Adam Heffner, the coroner who performed the autopsies for all of the Jigsaw victims thus far, that the knife used to cut the jigsaw piece from Eddies flesh was only used once before, on Seth Baxter. The agents intend to find the Baxter audio tape to prove Strahms involvement.While at the hospital to meet with Simone, Hoffman is met by reporter Pamela Jenkins, who claims to have found something at the meatpacking plant, but he dismisses her. He later meets with Jill Tuck at her clinic and tells her that he is taking control of the games. Jill gives him five envelopes from the box left to her in John Kramers will, each containing photos of people to be tested. After he leaves, a flashback reveals that John brought Amanda Young to Jill, who had deemed her a lost cause, as proof that his methods work. A later flashback, as Jill delivers a package from the box to the hospital, shows that Jill met with John at the plant hours before his death, where he gave her the boxs key and his promise that she would be protected when the games ended.William Easton, an insurance executive for Umbrella Health, meets with Debbie, the companys attorney, about Harold Abbott, who succumbed to heart disease after his coverage request was denied due to an application discrepancy. Hoffman abducts Easton from his office that night and brings him to an abandoned zoo, where he and his janitor, Hank, awaken in vises designed to tighten around their torsos each time they breathe into oxygen masks strapped to their faces. John himself appears in a videotape and informs William that he has one hour to complete four tests and remove the bombs strapped to his limbs, or he will lose his family. Hank, a heavy smoker, is unable to hold his breath and is killed by the vise. Williams other tests force him to choose which of his workers to save from various traps, including a hanging room, a steam room, and carousel trap. Flashbacks show that John met William at the opening of Jills clinic and took issue with his formula for only deeming policyholders worthy of coverage. After his cancer was diagnosed, Johns coverage request for an experimental Norwegian treatment was rejected by William.The game is viewed by a woman named Tara and her son Brent from a cage below the observation room, which contains a tank of hydrofluoric acid and a switch marked ""Live"" and ""Die"". Pamela awakens in another cage on the other side of the room. During the game, Hoffman is called away by Erickson and Perez, who found the Baxter audio tape and are having it unscrambled by an offsite technician. They inform him that abnormalities were found in Strahms fingerprints, and Erickson eventually reveals their knowledge of Strahms death. The moment his voice is unscrambled, Hoffman kills everyone in the room, with Perez mockingly telling him that everyone already knows of his involvement before she dies. He then plants fingerprints using Strahms severed hand, before dowsing fuel on the room and setting it on fire to destroy the evidence.He returns to the observation room and finds the letter he had written to Amanda, in which he had used his knowledge of her role in Jills miscarriage to blackmail her into killing Lynn Denlon. The letter was found by Pamela and given to Jill, who uses it to ambush Hoffman as William reaches the end of his path with one second left, finding himself between the cages. It is revealed that Pamela is his sister, while Tara and Brent are Harolds family. Tara is informed by a videotape of John that she can either kill William or free him using the switch; when she is unable to make a decision, Brent angrily shifts the switch to ""Die"" and a bed of needles swings down and injects Williams body with the acid, killing him. Jill restrains Hoffman and locks a new reverse bear trap to his head. She shows him the sixth envelope from Johns will, which contains his photo, and leaves him with 45 seconds but no key. Hoffman escapes by breaking his hand to free his wrist restraints and jams the trap in window bars as it activates. He then pulls his head free, ripping open his cheek in the process and screams in agony.",11000000,"[{""id"": 27, ""name"": ""Horror""}, {""id"": 9648, ""name"": ""Mystery""}]",http://www.saw6film.com/,22804,"[{""id"": 179430, ""name"": ""aftercreditsstinger""}]",en,"Special Agent Strahm is dead, and Detective Hoffman has emerged as the unchallenged successor to Jigsaw's legacy.

495,496,Secretariat,2010,/wiki/Secretariat_(film),"In 1969, Denver housewife and mother Penny Chenery (Diane Lane) agrees to take over her ailing father, Christopher Chenerys Meadow Stables in Doswell, Virginia, despite her lack of horse-racing knowledge.  With the help of veteran trainer Lucien Laurin (Malkovich), Chenery navigates the male-dominated business, ultimately fostering the first Triple Crown winner in 25 years and one of the greatest racehorses of all time.Penny learns of her mothers death and returns to her childhood home.  She reunites with Mrs. Ham, her fathers secretary, and comforts her confused and elderly father. At her mothers funeral, Penny meets Arthur ""Bull"" Hancock and his son, Seth Hancock, of Claiborne Farm in Kentucky. The Hancocks offer any help she may need during her efforts to bring Meadow Stables back to profitability. Pennys brother Hollis informs her of a dishonest sale that was about to be made by the trainer until their mother stopped him. Penny fires the trainer and asks Bull Hancock to help her find a new trainer. He recommends Lucien Laurin, an aging French Canadian, who initially turns down Pennys offer.Pennys father had made a deal with leading owner Ogden Phipps that if Phipps breeds his best stallion (Bold Ruler) to Chenerys two best mares (Somethingroyal and Hasty Matelda), the two owners would flip a coin to see who receives which foal. Bold Ruler, the stallion, was fast but couldnt last over distances. Hasty Matelda is the obvious choice for her young age, but Somethingroyals bloodline is made up of many horses with good stamina. Penny hopes to choose Somethingroyals foal for the interesting mix of speed and stamina. Phipps wins Hasty Mateldas foal, and Penny wins Somethingroyals foal, Secretariat.When Secretariat enters his first race at Aqueduct race track in Queens, New York City, everyone has high expectations. The jockey, Paul Feliciano, is very young with little experience, which worries Penny, but Lucien reassures her. During the race, Secretariat is repeatedly hit by other horses and comes in fourth. Penny and Lucien fight, and Lucien blames Paul for the loss. Penny realizes the only way Secretariat will ever win is if he has an experienced jockey. Pennys flight back home is canceled on the day of the race, and she misses her daughter Kates solo in a play. Her son holds up the pay phone so Penny can hear Kate sing.Penny gets experienced jockey Ron Turcotte to ride Secretariat to many victories. Secretariat is named horse of the year after a successful two-year-old season. Pennys father suffers a stroke and dies, leaving Penny and her brother Hollis to inherit the estate. Although she needs six million dollars to pay estate taxes, Penny refuses to sell Secretariat.Instead she syndicates the horse, selling 32 shares worth more than six million dollars, as long as he can win a three-year-old distance race. She tries to sell a share to Ogden Phipps, who instead offers to buy the horse for seven million dollars. Penny refuses to sell him. When Phipps demands to know why, she tells him Secretariats value will triple when he wins the Triple Crown – a feat no horse has accomplished in twenty-five years. During this time, Frank ""Pancho"" Martin, trainer of rival horse Sham, tries to provoke a match race with Secretariat.Secretariat is taken to the Wood Memorial three weeks before the first of the Triple Crown races to take on Sham and attempt to earn Penny her syndication money. Turcotte notices that the horses breathing is heavy, he refuses to eat, and he is reluctant to allow the bit into his mouth. After Secretariat loses the race, an abscess in his mouth is discovered that may have caused the poor performance.Secretariat recovers and wins both the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness in record time.  Sham comes in second place in both races and Pancho Martin tells Shams jockey, Laffit Pincay, to stay with Secretariat through the Belmont in an attempt to tire him early and win.  However, Secretariat runs an unbelievable race, finishing 31 lengths (over 82 yards (75 m)) ahead of the next horse to secure the Triple Crown.  An exhausted Sham ends up in last place, having failed to keep up with Secretariats record-breaking pace.

496,497,Seventh Son,2015,/wiki/Seventh_Son_(film),"In a prologue, the witch Mother Malkin is imprisoned in an underground chamber by Gregory, the last of a knightly order known as the Falcons, who have long defended mankind against supernatural threats. Several decades later, Gregory now works as a ""Spook,"" a roving witch hunter.The rise of the centennial blood moon allows Malkin to regain much of her power and break free from her prison. In a confrontation with the aged Gregory, she kills his apprentice, William Bradley, before escaping. Malkin returns to her dilapidated mountain fortress, restoring it, and her sister, Bony Lizzie, to their former condition. Gregory vows revenge.Gregory then seeks out Tom Ward, the seventh son of a seventh son, on a local farmstead, and recruits him as his newest apprentice. Before Tom leaves, his mother gives him her pendant as a talisman. On their way to Gregorys home, Tom sees a girl about to be burned by a mob as a witch. Recognizing her from clairvoyant visions he has had, he takes her from the mob and releases her. The girl, Alice, warns him not to let Gregory know about her. Alice is revealed to be Lizzies daughter, who spies on Gregory for her. Malkin begins gathering her army to conquer mankind.Tom meets Gregorys assistant Tusk, and rushes to learn what he needs to become a Spook before he and Gregory leave to confront Malkin at her fortress. Gregory warns that they only have a week before the blood moon is full, after which Malkin will become too powerful for them. En route to the fortress, Gregory is summoned to a walled city by an Inquisitor whose forces have subdued one of Malkins followers, a werebear named Urag. Gregory instructs Tom to burn the warlock alive, but Tom hesitates, causing Gregory to dismiss him while burning Urag himself. Tom meets Alice again and the two share their feelings for each other and fall in love. Later, they briefly consider going off on their own. But Tom has a vision of Malkin killing Gregory and unleashing destruction upon the world. Tom rejoins Gregory, who reveals that he once loved Malkin, and that is why he could not kill her, even after she murdered Gregorys own wife. Gregory feels responsible for every person killed by Malkin since then, and warns Tom that Alice must be killed, like all witches.Gregory, Tom, and Tusk are attacked on the road by an enormous boggart, and Tom narrowly manages to kill it and survive being swept down a waterfall. Tom is then confronted by Bony Lizzie, who attacks but is repelled by the necklace around his neck. John Gregory recognizes it as the Umbran Stone, which increases the power of witches. It originally belonged to Malkin, but one of her witch followers, Toms mother, stole it from her, weakening her enough for Gregory to trap her.Malkin instructs Alice to steal the stone from Tom, promising to spare his life if she does because she loves him. Malkin and her minions then raze the aforementioned walled city to the ground to avenge the death of Urag. Toms family happens to be in the city, and his mother sends her husband and daughter to safety, before managing to kill Strix the warlock and confronting Malkin with her own powers. Malkin kills her, mocking her for giving away the stone that would have saved her life.Out in the country, Alice reappears before Tom and pleads with him to leave with her, as he had suggested in their earlier meeting. Gregory tries to kill her, but Tom, blinded by love, stops him, proclaiming ""Shes not the enemy!"". He lets her flee, but Gregory points out she has taken the Umbran stone from around Toms neck, replying, ""Now tell me shes innocent!"". Tom realizes her reappearance had been a ruse, and pursues her, with Gregory and Tusk following. Then Malkins servant Radu attacks them, capturing Gregory and driving Tusk and Tom over a cliff, wrongly believing them dead. Tom has a vision of his mother, telling him that as both the seventh son of a seventh son, and the son of a witch, he is unique and has the power to defeat Malkin.The witches gather as Malkin attempts to seduce Gregory with her magic. Alice is horrified to hear that Tom was left for dead. In remorse, she grabs the stone from Malkin, breaking Malkins hold on Gregory. As Malkin transforms into a dragon to kill Alice, Lizzie also transforms, to protect her daughter. Tom retrieves the stone and, fighting together, Gregory, Tom and Alice kill several of Malkins minions. Malkin defeats and kills Lizzie for her disloyalty, but is seriously wounded in turn. Gregory confronts Malkin in her room, alone. She appears close to death, bitterly recalling her and Gregorys relationship, but then she seizes him with her claws. Tom arrives and hurls a blade at Malkin, freeing Gregory, who retreats. Tom finishes her off by burning her body.Afterwards, Gregory acknowledges Toms training is complete and brands his hand as a new Falcon knight. Alice appears, but accepts that Toms commitment to his new vocation means they cannot be together at the present. She promises Tom that theyll meet again, before disappearing.

497,498,Sex and the City 2,2010,/wiki/Sex_and_the_City_2,"Carrie, Samantha, Charlotte, and Miranda meet up. In flashback Carrie is depicted arriving in New York City in 1986, meeting Charlotte in 1987, Miranda in 1989, and meeting Samantha, when she was a bartender at the music club CBGB.In the present, Carrie, Charlotte, and Miranda are married but Samantha, aged 52, is desperately trying to keep her libido alive with the help of ""Suzanne Somers and her team of doctors"" to keep her menopause at bay.  The four of them attend Anthony and Stanfords wedding, where Carrie serves as ""best man"". Miranda quits her job after her firms misogynistic new managing partner disrespects her once too often. Charlottes two children are a handful (mostly her two-year-old daughter Roses extreme and constant crying), and shes worried that Harry is attracted to their buxom Irish nanny, Erin. Carries marriage to Mr. Big has settled down, although they differ on how to spend their spare time. For their anniversary, Carrie gives Mr. Big a vintage Rolex watch engraved with a romantic message, while he, much to her dismay, shows her a new TV in their bedroom as his gift, which Big says they can use to watch old movies together, something they did at the hotel at Anthony and Stanfords wedding and seemed to enjoy. Carrie, however, is disappointed, as she had hoped for jewelry as a gift.Meanwhile, Samantha has been approached by an Arab sheikh to devise a PR campaign for his business. He offers to fly her and her friends on an all-expenses-paid luxury vacation to Abu Dhabi. The girls happily accept, although Carrie is worried about the separation from Big, and Charlotte is worried about leaving her husband alone with the nanny. Only Miranda, unfettered by a job for the first time in her life, is enthusiastic. Upon entering Abu Dhabi, Samanthas hormone-enhancing drugs are confiscated under UAE law. This renders her devoid of estrogen, and her famous libido goes dead. Charlotte tries to call Harry every few minutes; Miranda revels in the luxury surrounding her; and Carrie befriends her manservant, Gaurau, who is an underpaid temporary worker from India.Carrie runs into her former lover, Aidan. He proposes dinner à deux at his hotel, and she decides to accept. The dinner is very enjoyable, with the two discussing old times. Aidan remarks on the ways Carrie is ""not like other women"". In a moment of remembered passion, they kiss. Carrie runs away in panic and returns to her hotel. Back at their hotel, Miranda and Charlotte have drinks together and discuss the difficulties of motherhood. Carrie arrives, tells her friends about the kiss, and asks them whether she should tell Big, as they have no secrets between them. Miranda reflects on the events of the previous film, when her husband, Steve, told her about his affair. Samantha counsels Carrie to wait before deciding anything. Carrie opts to call Big to tell him. Big is silent upon hearing the news, and after saying a few words, hangs up.The four women find their style and Western attitudes contrast with Muslim customs. For example, while on a date with a handsome Dane, Samantha is arrested for public indecency after fondling him at a restaurant and making out with him on the beach. With the Sheikhs intervention, Samantha is released but is left with a permanent police record. Worse, the Sheikh decides to cancel the PR meeting and ceases paying for the remainder of the womens luxurious stay. They are told they have 1 hour to either pay $22,000 a night for the rest of their stay or leave. They quickly pack their bags and leave, but must return to the souq to find Carries passport. When Samanthas flamboyance nearly incites a riot, the women are rescued by a group of Emirati women who share their sense of style under their black robes.When Carrie returns home, she finds the bedroom television removed and Big gone. She passes an anxious day, at the end of which he returns. Big tells her that although he was ""pretty torn up"", he realizes that what she needs is something to remind her at all times that she is married. He hands her a jewelry box, which reveals an engagement ring set with a black diamond. When Carrie asks him why a black diamond, he says, ""Because youre not like anyone else"", echoing Aidans earlier comment.Big and Carrie combine their interests; Charlottes nanny, Erin, turns out to be a lesbian and no threat to her marriage; Miranda finds a new job at a more laid back and diverse law firm where she is appreciated; and Samantha remains unchanged, and even meets for sex on the beach with the Danish architect she met in Abu Dhabi, this time in The Hamptons.",100000000,"[{""id"": 35, ""name"": ""Comedy""}, {""id"": 18, ""name"": ""Drama""}, {""id"": 10749, ""name"": ""Romance""}]",http://www.sexandthecitymovie.com/,37786,[],en,"Carrie, Charlotte, and Miranda are all married now, but they're still up for a little fun in the sun.

Inspector Lestrade and the police arrest Blackwood. Three months later, Watson is engaged to Mary Morstan and moving out of 221B Baker Street; while he enjoys their adventures together, Watson looks forward to not having to deal with Holmes eccentricities. Meanwhile, Blackwood has been sentenced to death and requests to see Holmes, whom he warns of three more unstoppable deaths that will cause great changes to the world. Blackwood is subsequently hanged.Holmes is visited by Irene Adler, a former adversary who asks him to find a missing man named Luke Reordan. After her departure, Holmes follows her as she meets with her secret employer, and only learns that the man is a professor and that he intimidates Adler. Meanwhile, sightings of a living Blackwood and the discovery of his destroyed tomb lead to belief that Blackwood has risen from the grave. Reordan is found dead inside Blackwoods coffin. Following a series of clues from the body, Holmes and Watson find Reordans home and discover experiments attempting to merge science with magic. After they survive a battle with Blackwoods men who attempt to destroy the lab, Holmes is taken to the Temple of the Four Orders, a secret magical fraternity with considerable political influence. The leaders—Lord Chief Justice Sir Thomas Rotheram, U.S. Ambassador Standish, and Home Secretary Lord Coward—ask Holmes to stop Blackwood, a former member of the society and Sir Thomass secret illegitimate son.That night, Sir Thomas drowns in his bath as Blackwood watches, and the next night Lord Coward calls a meeting of the Order. He nominates Blackwood to take command in place of Sir Thomas and Blackwood reveals himself to the group. Standish attempts to shoot Blackwood but is set on fire when he pulls the trigger of his gun, and runs out a window to his death. Lord Coward issues an arrest warrant for Holmes, causing him to go into hiding. Holmes studies the rituals of the Order and recognizes their symbols in Blackwoods murders that were staged at specific locations; from this he deduces the targets of the final murder are the members of Parliament. With the aid of Lestrade, Holmes fakes arrest and is taken to see Coward, where he uses evidence on Cowards clothes to deduce Blackwood has conducted a ceremony in the sewers beneath the Palace of Westminster.Holmes escapes and he, Watson, and Adler find Blackwoods men in the sewers guarding a device based on Reordans experiments, designed to release cyanide gas into the Parliament chambers and kill all but Blackwoods supporters, whom he has secretly given an antidote. Blackwood comes before Parliament and announces their impending deaths, then attempts to activate the cyanide device by remote control, but it is disabled by Adler. Blackwood flees Parliament and sees Adler and Holmes in the sewers, and pursues them to the top of the incomplete Tower Bridge.

500,501,Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows,2011,/wiki/Sherlock_Holmes:_A_Game_of_Shadows,"In 1891, Irene Adler delivers a package to Dr. Hoffmanstahl, payment for a letter he was to deliver. Hoffmanstahl opens the package, triggering a hidden bomb that is prevented from detonating by the intervention of Sherlock Holmes. Holmes takes the letter while Adler and Hoffmanstahl escape. Holmes finds Hoffmanstahl assassinated moments later. Adler meets with Professor Moriarty to explain the events, but Moriarty, deeming her position compromised by her love for Holmes, poisons and kills her.Later, Dr. Watson arrives at 221B Baker Street, where Holmes discloses that he is investigating a series of seemingly unrelated murders, terrorist attacks and business acquisitions around the globe that he has connected to Moriarty. After meeting up with his brother Mycroft at Watsons bachelor party, Holmes meets with Gypsy fortune-teller Simza, the intended recipient of the letter he took from Adler, sent by her brother Rene. Holmes defeats an assassin sent to kill Simza, but she flees before Holmes can interrogate her. After the wedding of Watson and Mary Morstan, Holmes meets Moriarty for the first time. Holmes subtly requests Watson and Mary be left alone now that Watson is no longer working with him, but Moriarty indicates he will kill them if Holmes interferes. Voicing his respect for Holmes perseverance, Moriarty informs Holmes that he murdered Adler. Holmes vengefully vows to defeat him.Moriartys men attack Watson and Mary on a train to their honeymoon. Holmes, having followed the pair to protect them, throws Mary from the train into a river below where she is rescued by Mycroft. After defeating Moriartys men, Holmes and Watson travel to Paris to locate Simza. When she is found, Holmes tells Simza that she has been targeted because Rene is working for Moriarty and may have told her about his plans. Simza takes the pair to the headquarters of an anarchist group to which she and Rene had formerly belonged. They learn that the anarchists have been forced to plant bombs for Moriarty.The trio follows Holmes deduction that the bomb is in the Paris Opera. However, Holmes realizes too late that he has been tricked and that the bomb is in a nearby hotel; its explosion kills a number of assembled businessmen. Holmes discovers that the bomb was a cover for the specific assassination of Alfred Meinhard, one of the attendees, by Moriartys henchman, Sebastian Moran. Meinhards death grants Moriarty ownership of Meinhards arms factory in Germany. Holmes, not wishing to repeat his mistake from the previous evening, spies on Moriarty, learning he is travelling to Germany. Holmes deduces it is to visit his newly acquired factory and so the trio follow him there.At the factory, Moriarty captures, interrogates, and tortures Holmes while Watson fights Moran. Holmes spells out Moriartys plot, revealing that the Professor secretly acquired shares in multiple war profiteering companies using various pseudonyms to conceal his identity and intends to instigate a world war to make himself a fortune. Meanwhile, Watson uses the cannon he had been hiding behind to destroy the watchtower in which Moran is concealed. The structure collapses into the warehouse where Moriarty is holding Holmes captive. Watson, Simza, and an injured Holmes reunite and escape aboard a moving train. Holmes deduces that Moriartys final target will be a peace summit in Switzerland, creating an international incident.At the summit, Holmes deduces that Rene is the assassin and that he is disguised as one of the ambassadors, having been given radical reconstructive surgery by Hoffmanstahl. Holmes and Moriarty, who is also in attendance, retreat upon a balcony to discuss their competing plans over a game of chess. Watson and Simza find Rene and stop his assassination attempt, but Rene is discreetly killed by Moran. Despite his war being averted, Moriarty remains confident in his victory, warning Holmes that the nations of Europe will inevitably go to war with one another regardless of Moriartys manipulations. Holmes then reveals that, while being tortured by Moriarty, he replaced the professors personal diary that contained all his plans and financing with a duplicate. The original was sent to Mary in London, who decrypted the code using a book that Holmes had noticed in Moriartys office during their first meeting, before passing the information to Inspector Lestrade, who seizes Moriartys assets and donates his fortune to anti-war charities. Holmes and Moriarty anticipate an impending physical altercation, and both realise that Moriarty would win due to Holmes injured shoulder. Out of options and with the sadistic Moriarty promising to torture and kill Watson and Mary afterward, Holmes grabs Moriarty and lunges backwards over the balcony and into the Reichenbach Falls below. Both are presumed dead.Following Holmes funeral, Watson and Mary prepare to have their belated honeymoon when Watson receives a package containing a breathing device of Mycrofts that Holmes had noticed and expressed a liking for before the summit. Realizing that Holmes may still be alive, Watson leaves his office to find the delivery man.

She implores him to find a way of getting rid of Shrek. Harold arranges for Shrek and Donkey to join him on a fictitious hunting trip, which is actually a trap to lure them into the hands of an assassin, Puss in Boots. Unable to defeat Shrek, Puss reveals that he was paid by Harold and offers to come along and make amends. The three sneak into the Fairy Godmothers potion factory and steal a ""Happily Ever After"" potion that Shrek thinks will restore Fionas love for him.Shrek and Donkey both drink the potion and fall into a deep sleep, awakening the next morning to discover its effects: Shrek is now a handsome man while Donkey has turned into an elegant white stallion. In order to make the change permanent, Shrek must kiss Fiona by midnight. Shrek, Donkey and Puss return to the castle to discover that the potion has transformed Fiona back into her former human self as well. However, the Fairy Godmother, having discovered the potions theft, intercepts Shrek and sends Charming to pose as him and win Fionas love. At the Fairy Godmothers urging, Shrek leaves the castle, thinking that the best way to make Fiona happy is to let her go.To ensure that Fiona falls in love with Charming, the Fairy Godmother gives Harold a love potion to put into Fionas tea. This exchange is overheard by Shrek, Donkey and Puss, who are arrested by the royal guards and thrown into a dungeon. While the royal ball begins, several of Shreks friends band together to free the trio with the help of The Muffin Mans monster-sized gingerbread man, which breaks through the castles defenses. Shrek is too late to prevent Charming from kissing Fiona, but instead of falling in love with Charming, Fiona knocks him out with a headbutt. Harold reveals that he never gave Fiona the love potion, whereupon the now-enraged Fairy Godmother attacks Shrek. In the ensuing melee, Harold sacrifices himself to save Shrek; his armor ricochets a spell cast by the Fairy Godmother which disintegrates her, and Harold is turned back into the Frog Prince, his original form. Harold gives his blessing to the marriage and apologizes for his earlier behavior, admitting his use of the Happily Ever After potion years earlier to gain Lillians love.As the clock strikes midnight, Fiona rejects Shreks offer to remain humans, and they happily let the potions effects wear off and revert to their ogre forms, while Donkey changes back to his natural form as well.

The three sneak into the Fairy Godmothers potion factory and steal a ""Happily Ever After"" potion that Shrek thinks will restore Fionas love for him.Shrek and Donkey both drink the potion and fall into a deep sleep, awakening the next morning to discover its effects: Shrek is now a handsome man while Donkey has turned into an elegant white stallion. In order to make the change permanent, Shrek must kiss Fiona by midnight. Shrek, Donkey and Puss return to the castle to discover that the potion has transformed Fiona back into her former human self as well.

While the royal ball begins, several of Shreks friends band together to free the trio with the help of The Muffin Mans monster-sized gingerbread man, which breaks through the castles defenses. Shrek is too late to prevent Charming from kissing Fiona, but instead of falling in love with Charming, Fiona knocks him out with a headbutt. Harold reveals that he never gave Fiona the love potion, whereupon the now-enraged Fairy Godmother attacks Shrek.

505,506,Shrek Forever After,2010,/wiki/Shrek_Forever_After,"In a flashback, King Harold and Queen Lillian are about to sign the kingdom of Far Far Away over to Rumpelstiltskin, in exchange for lifting their daughters curse. The deal is abruptly cancelled at the last second when a knight informs the King and Queen that Princess Fiona has been rescued by Shrek. An angry Rumpelstiltskin laments his loss and wishes that Shrek was never born.In the present time, Shrek has grown steadily weary of being a family man and celebrity among the local villagers, leading him to wish for when he felt like a ""real ogre"" again. When he takes his family to Far Far Away to celebrate his childrens first birthday, a series of mishaps further injure his ego, causing him to lose his temper and walk out in anger.Shrek encounters Rumpelstiltskin, who seizes his chance, having observed Shreks angry outburst. He follows Shrek and arranges for him to appear to save his life. He gives Shrek a day to live like a real ogre, in exchange for a day from his childhood that he would not remember being erased to ""thank"" him.Shrek signs the contract and appears in an alternate reality where the events starting from Fionas rescue are irrelevant. Now feared by villagers, he takes the opportunity to cause some lighthearted mischief until he finds ""WANTED"" posters for Fiona and his home deserted and desolate. He is kidnapped by witches and taken to Rumpel, now the King of Far Far Away, which has become derelict and run down.Upon inquiry, Rumpel reveals that he took away the day Shrek was born. Therefore, Shrek never saved Fiona or met Donkey, and consequently Rumpel was able to trick King Harold and Queen Lillian into signing their kingdom over to him, making them both disappear. When the day ends, Shrek will disappear as well as he was never born in this timeline. Shrek escapes Rumpels castle with Donkey. Initially terrified of Shrek, Donkey decides to trust him after seeing Shrek cry over his erased history, something he had never seen an ogre do before. After Shrek explains the situation, Donkey helps him find a hidden exit clause: the contract can be nullified by ""true loves kiss"".They soon encounter an army of ogres who are resisting Rumpel. The ogres are led by a still-cursed Fiona who, after escaping from the tower where she was held captive, keeps the retired and overweight Puss in Boots as a pet. Shrek does everything he can to gain Fionas love, but she is too busy preparing an ambush on Rumpel. She is also bitterly cynical and disillusioned about the power of true love and throws herself into planning Rumpels capture. While sparring with her, Fiona begins to like Shrek, but stops short of kissing him. Puss encourages him to continue pursuing Fiona.During the ambush, the ogres are captured by the Pied Piper, though Shrek and Fiona escape with the intervention of Puss and Donkey. Shrek insists Fiona kiss him, saying it will fix everything; however, because in this altered timeline Fiona does not truly love him, the kiss does not work. When he hears that Rumpel is offering a wish to the one who brings him Shrek, Shrek turns himself in and uses the wish to free the other ogres. Afterwards, Rumpel reveals a captured Fiona whom he is going to feed to Dragon along with Shrek. Donkey leads the Ogre army to storm the castle, battle the witches, and capture Rumpel, while Shrek and Fiona trap Dragon.As the sun rises, Shrek begins to fade from existence, but Fiona, having fallen in love with him, kisses Shrek just before he disappears, restoring Shrek to his world just before he lashed out at the party.

Shreks attempts at trying to serve as the Regent during the Kings medical leave end in disaster, and he insists that an ogre as king is a bad idea and that there must be someone else to rule the kingdom. Before he dies, Harold tells Shrek of another heir: his nephew, Arthur ""Artie"" Pendragon. Prince Charming goes to the Poison Apple tavern and persuades fairy tale villains to fight for their ""happily ever after"" by appealing to the defeats given in their stories.Shrek, Donkey and Puss in Boots set out to retrieve Artie; as they are sailing away, Fiona reveals to Shrek that she is pregnant, much to Shreks horror, as he believes he isnt capable of raising children. The trio journey to Worcestershire Academy, an elite magical boarding school, where they discover Artie is a scrawny 16-year-old underachiever picked on by everyone. At the school pep rally, Shrek tells Artie he is going to be king of Far Far Away. Artie is excited until Donkey and Puss inadvertently frighten him by discussing the responsibilities of being king. As a result, Artie becomes afraid of being king and tries taking control of the ship to go back to Worcestershire and as he and Shrek fight over the wheel, it breaks causing the ship to crash on a remote island, where they meet Arties retired wizard teacher, Merlin.Meanwhile, Charming and the other villains attack the castle, but Wolfie, Pinocchio, Gingy, the Three Little Pigs and the Blind Mice stall them long enough for Fiona and her mother Queen Lillian to escape along with Snow White, Rapunzel, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, and Doris the Ugly Stepsister.

To save Arties life, Shrek tells Charming that Artie was a pawn to take his place as King of Far Far Away. Charming believes Shrek and allows an angry Artie to leave. Donkey and Puss are imprisoned with Fiona and the ladies, where Fiona grows frustrated with their lack of initiative.

508,509,Shrek the Third,2016,/wiki/Shrek_the_Third,"After a failed performance in a play at a theatre, Prince Charming vows that he will become King of Far, Far Away and avenge the death of his mother, the Fairy Godmother. Meanwhile,  Shrek and daughter Princess Fiona are to succeed the dying King Harold. Shreks attempts at trying to serve as the Regent during the Kings medical leave end in disaster, and he insists that an ogre as king is a bad idea and that there must be someone else to rule the kingdom. Before he dies, Harold tells Shrek of another heir: his nephew, Arthur ""Artie"" Pendragon. Prince Charming goes to the Poison Apple tavern and persuades fairy tale villains to fight for their ""happily ever after"" by appealing to the defeats given in their stories.Shrek, Donkey and Puss in Boots set out to retrieve Artie; as they are sailing away, Fiona reveals to Shrek that she is pregnant, much to Shreks horror, as he believes he isnt capable of raising children. The trio journey to Worcestershire Academy, an elite magical boarding school, where they discover Artie is a scrawny 16-year-old underachiever picked on by everyone. At the school pep rally, Shrek tells Artie he is going to be king of Far Far Away. Artie is excited until Donkey and Puss inadvertently frighten him by discussing the responsibilities of being king. As a result, Artie becomes afraid of being king and tries taking control of the ship to go back to Worcestershire and as he and Shrek fight over the wheel, it breaks causing the ship to crash on a remote island, where they meet Arties retired wizard teacher, Merlin.Meanwhile, Charming and the other villains attack the castle, but Wolfie, Pinocchio, Gingy, the Three Little Pigs and the Blind Mice stall them long enough for Fiona and her mother Queen Lillian to escape along with Snow White, Rapunzel, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, and Doris the Ugly Stepsister. One of the Pigs accidentally blurts out that Shrek has gone to retrieve Arthur, and Prince Charming sends Captain Hook and his pirates to track down Shrek. The ladies are put in a tower after Rapunzel betrays them when she falls in love with Charming.Captain Hook and his pirates track Shrek and his friends to Merlins island, where they attempt to capture Shrek alive and defeat the others. Shrek and Artie defeat the villains, and Hook mentions Charming and the takeover of Far Far Away. Concerned for his wife and future child, Shrek urges Artie to return to Worcestershire. Instead, Artie cons Merlin into using his magic to send them to Far Far Away. The spell works, but causes Puss and Donkey to accidentally switch bodies. They find Pinocchio and learn that Charming plans to kill Shrek as part of a play. Charmings men arrive, but Artie tricks the knights into not taking them into custody and they break into the castle during rehearsals for the play. Caught in Charmings dressing room, the four are taken captive.Charming prepares to kill Artie, believing he is the next king. To save Arties life, Shrek tells Charming that Artie was a pawn to take his place as King of Far Far Away. Charming believes Shrek and allows an angry Artie to leave. Donkey and Puss are imprisoned with Fiona and the ladies, where Fiona grows frustrated with their lack of initiative. Fionas mother, Queen Lillian, expertly smashes an opening in the stone wall of the prison with a headbutt. While the princesses launch a rescue mission for Shrek, Donkey and Puss free Gingy, Pinocchio, the wolf and pigs, and Dragon and Donkeys children. They encounter Artie, still angry, but Puss and Donkey mollify him by explaining that Shrek lied to Charming to save Arties life.By nightfall, Charming stages a musical in front of the kingdom. Just as Charming is about to kill Shrek, Fiona, along with Puss, Donkey, the princesses and the fairy tale characters confront the villains. They lose, and Fiona is tied up. Artie shows up and convinces the villains that just because they are being treated like losers does not mean that they have to be losers. Touched by Arties speech, all the villains agree to give up their evil ways.

509,510,Shutter Island,2010,/wiki/Shutter_Island_(film),"In 1954, U.S. Marshals Edward ""Teddy"" Daniels and his new partner Chuck Aule travel to the Ashecliffe Hospital for the criminally insane on Shutter Island in Boston Harbor. They are investigating the disappearance of patient Rachel Solando, who was incarcerated for drowning her three children. Their only clue is a cryptic note found hidden in Solandos room: ""The law of 4; who is 67?"" They arrive just before a storm hits, preventing their return to the mainland for a few days.Daniels and Aule find the staff confrontational. Dr. John Cawley, the lead psychiatrist, refuses to turn over records, and they learn that Solandos doctor Lester Sheehan left the island on vacation immediately after Solando disappeared. They are given access to the hospital, but they are told that Ward C is off limits and that the lighthouse has already been searched. While being interviewed, one patient secretly writes the word ""RUN"" in Daniels notepad. Daniels starts to have migraine headaches from the hospitals atmosphere and experiences waking visions of his involvement in the Dachau liberation reprisals. He has disturbing dreams of his wife Dolores Chanal, who was killed in a fire set by a local arsonist named Andrew Laeddis. In one instance, she tells him that Solando is still on the island somewhere—as is Laeddis, who everyone claims was never there to begin with. Daniels later explains to Aule that locating Laeddis was an ulterior personal motive for taking the case.During their investigation, Daniels and Aule find that Solando has abruptly resurfaced with no explanation as to her former whereabouts or how she escaped. This prompts Daniels to break into the restricted Ward C. There he encounters George Noyce, a patient in solitary confinement. Noyce warns him that the doctors are performing questionable experiments on the patients, some of whom are taken to the lighthouse to be lobotomized. Noyce warns Daniels that everyone else on the island is playing an elaborate game specifically designed for Daniels—including his partner Aule.Daniels regroups with Aule and is determined to investigate the lighthouse. They become separated while climbing the cliffs toward it, and Daniels later sees what he believes to be Aules body on the rocks below. By the time he climbs down, however, the body has disappeared, but he finds a cave where he discovers a woman in hiding who claims to be the real Rachel Solando. She states that she is a former psychiatrist at the hospital who discovered the experiments with psychotropic medication and trans-orbital lobotomy in an attempt to develop mind control techniques. Before she could report her findings to the authorities, however, she was forcibly committed to Ashecliffe as a patient. Daniels returns to the hospital, but finds no evidence of Aule ever being there.Daniels is convinced that Aule was taken to the lighthouse; he breaks into it only to discover Cawley calmly waiting there for him. Cawley explains that Daniels is actually Andrew Laeddis, their ""most dangerous patient"" incarcerated in Ward C for murdering his manic depressive wife Dolores Chanal after she drowned their children. Edward Daniels and Rachel Solando are anagrams of Andrew Laeddis and Dolores Chanal; furthermore, the little girl from Laeddis recurring dreams is his daughter Rachel.According to Cawley, the events of the past several days have been designed to break Laeddis conspiracy-laden insanity by allowing him to play out the role of Daniels. The hospital staff were part of the test, including Dr. Sheehan posing as Aule and a nurse posing as Rachel Solando. The migraines that Laeddis suffered were withdrawal symptoms from his medication, as were the hallucinations of the ""real Rachel Solando"". Overwhelmed, Laeddis faints.Laeddis awakens in the hospital under watch of Cawley and Sheehan. When questioned, he tells the truth in a coherent manner, which satisfies the doctors as a sign of progression. Nevertheless, Cawley notes that they had achieved this state nine months before but Laeddis had quickly regressed, and further warns that this will be his last chance to redeem himself.Some time later, Laeddis relaxes on the hospital grounds with Dr. Sheehan, but he calls him ""Chuck"" and says that they need to leave the island. Sheehan shakes his head to an observing Cawley, who gestures to the orderlies. Laeddis asks Dr. Sheehan if it is worse to live as a monster or die as a good man. With Sheehan looking at him in surprise and shock, Laeddis calmly gets up and walks towards the orderlies, and they leave together, presumably to the lighthouse.",80000000,"[{""id"": 18, ""name"": ""Drama""}, {""id"": 53, ""name"": ""Thriller""}, {""id"": 9648, ""name"": ""Mystery""}]",http://www.shutterisland.com/,11324,"[{""id"": 818, ""name"": ""based on novel""}, {""id"": 2041, ""name"": ""island""}, {""id"": 2215, ""name"": ""hurricane""}, {""id"": 5340, ""name"": ""investigation""}, {""id"": 10323, ""name"": ""psychiatric hospital""}, {""id"": 11207, ""name"": ""u.s. marshal""}, {""id"": 11208, ""name"": ""conspiracy theory""}, {""id"": 208611, ""name"": ""1950s""}]",en,"World War II soldier-turned-U.S. Marshal Teddy Daniels investigates the disappearance of a patient from a hospital for the criminally insane, but his efforts are compromised by his troubling visions and also by a mysterious doctor.",81.914696,"[{""name"": ""Paramount Pictures"", ""id"": 4}, {""name"": ""Appian Way"", ""id"": 562}, {""name"": ""Phoenix Pictures"", ""id"": 11317}, {""name"": ""Sikelia Productions"", ""id"": 23243}]","[{""iso_3166_1"": ""US"", ""name"": ""United States of America""}]",2/18/2010,294804195,138,"[{""iso_639_1"": ""en"", ""name"": ""English""}, {""iso_639_1"": ""de"", ""name"": ""Deutsch""}]",Released,Someone is missing.,Shutter Island,7.8,6336,0.779420495,0.297004998,0.790892124,0.5,0.290892124,-0.493887126,0.482415497,0.422398249,3.685052438
510,511,Side Effects,2013,/wiki/Side_Effects_(2013_film),"After her husband Martin completes a four-year prison sentence for insider trading, Emily Taylor drives into a wall in an apparent suicide attempt. Jonathan Banks, her assigned psychiatrist, prescribes a series of antidepressants, but none work. Jonathan contacts Emilys previous psychiatrist, Victoria Siebert, who suggests an experimental new drug, Ablixa. The drug seems to help Emily, but gives her sleepwalking episodes as a side effect.One night, Emily stabs Martin to death while sleepwalking. Jonathan fights for Emilys acquittal in court. She pleads insanity and is declared not guilty on the condition that she stays in a psychiatric hospital until cleared by Jonathan. The publicity destroys Jonathans reputation, and his colleagues assume negligence on his part.Jonathan discovers evidence that Emily is lying; she was not depressed and faked her suicide attempts. He also discovers someone may have profited from Ablixas fall in stock value. He interviews Emily after administering what he claims is a truth serum that will make her drowsy. Though the serum is actually saline water, she feigns drowsiness, confirming Jonathans suspicion that she is deceiving him. When he confronts Victoria with his findings, she mails photographs to his wife Deirdre implying he had an affair with Emily. Deirdre leaves him, taking her son with her.Jonathan calls Victorias bluff by telling her Emily told him about their plot. He threatens Emily with electric shock treatment and tells her Victoria is paying him to keep her incarcerated so she can keep a bigger cut. Emily explains that she hated Martin for losing their opulent lifestyle, and began plotting to kill him to and profit. She began seeing Victoria for counseling, and the women became lovers. Emily taught Victoria about the financial world, while Victoria taught Emily how to fake psychiatric disorders. They plotted to kill Martin and use the negative Ablixa publicity to manipulate stock prices. Jonathan accepts Emilys offer to give him a cut of her money if he releases her from the ward.Emily meets Victoria while wearing a wire. After Victoria mentions details of the plot, she is arrested for conspiracy to commit murder and securities fraud. Emily, due to double jeopardy, cannot be charged as criminally responsible for her part in Martins murder.As retaliation for Emilys part in the plot, Jonathan, who still oversees her case, prescribes her Thorazine and Depakote and describes their unpleasant side effects.

511,512,Silent Hill,2012,/wiki/Silent_Hill_(film),"Rose Da Silva and her husband Christopher are deeply disturbed by their adopted daughter Sharons constant sleepwalking and nightmares about Silent Hill, a town that was abandoned 30 years ago due to a massive coal seam fire. Against Christophers wishes, Rose takes Sharon on a trip to Silent Hill to find answers. Her erratic behaviour concerns police officer Cybil Bennett. Rose flees from Cybil, but when a girl steps out into the road, Rose crashes and blacks out. Waking up some time later, Rose finds herself in the foggy dimension of Silent Hill and realizes that Sharon is missing.Searching the town for Sharon, Rose pursues the same girl she encountered prior to the crash, who turns out to resemble Sharon in appearance. At various points, the town transitions into a nightmarish dimension inhabited by inhuman monsters, including the fearsome Pyramid Head. Rose survives the transitions and consequently learns of the existence of Alessa Gillespie, a young girl burnt by the Brethren, the towns fanatical cult. Her mother Dahlia wanders the streets as an outcast, guilty for her negligence that led to Alessas doom. Rose is later joined by Cybil, also trapped in the foggy dimension of the town due to a giant fracture isolating Silent Hill. Meanwhile, in the real world, Christopher searches the abandoned town with policeman Thomas Gucci, but their search is in vain. Upon finding a photo of Alessa, Christopher goes to the orphanage where Sharon was adopted. Gucci appears, revealing he lived in Silent Hill and saved Alessa from the fire. He encourages Christopher to end his futile search and go home.In the Silent Hill dimension, Rose and Cybil explore a hotel the Brethren once used, accompanied by Anna, a Brethren member, where they find the burnt remains of a ceremonial chamber. Rose also encounters the girl, revealed to be an aspect of Alessa. When the town transitions into the dark dimension, Rose, Cybil, and Anna flee to an old church but Pyramid Head emerges and skins Anna alive. Inside, Christabella, the high priestess of the Brethren, and Alessas aunt, suggests a ""demon"" knows where Sharon is. Her followers lead Rose and Cybil to a hospital, claiming the demon is in the basement. Christabella sees a photo of Sharon from Roses locket and brands Rose and Cybil as ""witches"" due to Sharon resembling Alessa. Cybil fights the Brethren members but Christabella orders them to violently beat her.Rose enters the basement, but she is barricaded by a group of weapon-wielding nurses who appear to be almost completely blind due to their disfigured, covered faces. Although light and sound attract them, Rose manages to sneak through them, inadvertently startling them into attacking each other. She flees and enters Alessas room. In a flashback, it is revealed that Alessa was stigmatised by the townspeople for being a bastard. Christabella convinces Dahlia, a formerly devout Brethren member, to ""purify"" Alessa, after Alessa is raped whilst attempting to hide from her tormentors. Christabella immolates Alessa during a ritual but Dahlia realises this and alerts Gucci. They arrive too late as the ritual goes awry, igniting the infamous coal seam fire. Hospitalised, Alessas rage grew and manifested as Dark Alessa, who is responsible for the shifting dimensions of Silent Hill. Her remaining innocence is later manifested as Sharon, who is taken to the real world to be adopted. Desperate to find Sharon, Rose allows Dark Alessa access to the church by fusing with her body. Meanwhile, Sharon, protected by Dahlia, is captured by the Brethren.In the church, Christabella burns Cybil to death and plans to do the same to Sharon. Rose intervenes and confronts Christabella in regards to her crimes but Christabella stabs her in the heart in retaliation. Roses blood summons both the original Alessa and Dark Alessa, who bisect and kill Christabella and her followers, except for Dahlia, with razor wire. Rose rescues Sharon, and, upon seeing Dark Alessa, Sharon and Alessa/Dark Alessa reunite into one body. Rose and Alessa leave the town and return home.

512,513,Silver Linings Playbook,2012,/wiki/Silver_Linings_Playbook,"After eight months of treatment in a mental health facility for bipolar disorder, Patrizio ""Pat"" Solitano, Jr. (Bradley Cooper) is released into the care of his father Patrizio, Sr. (Robert De Niro) and mother Dolores (Jacki Weaver) at his childhood home in Upper Darby, Pennsylvania. His main focus is to reconcile with his ex-wife, Nikki (Brea Bee). She has moved away and obtained a restraining order against him after Pat had found her in the shower with another man and nearly beat him to death. During his time in the clinic Pat befriends Danny McDaniels (Chris Tucker), an easygoing man who is embroiled in a legal dispute with the clinic on whether or not he is eligible to leave. Pats therapist, Dr. Patel (Anupam Kher), does his best to convince him to keep taking his medication, as a repeat of his violent outbursts might send him back to the clinic. But Pat tells him that he has a new outlook on life: he attempts to see the good, or silver linings, in all that he experiences.  Patrizio employs the Latin phrase ""Excelsior"" translated as ""always higher"" or ""ever upward"" as the mantra of his new positive outlook.At dinner with his friend Ronnie (John Ortiz) and his wife Veronica (Julia Stiles), Pat meets Veronicas sister Tiffany Maxwell (Jennifer Lawrence), a young widow with depression and relationship problems. They connect over dinner talking about different medications they took since theyre both mentally ill. Sparks fly between Pat and Tiffany and she tries to connect by offering casual sex, but Pat keeps focusing on getting Nikki back. Tiffany tries to get closer to Pat and even offers to deliver a letter to Nikki—if, in return, he will practice dancing with her (which she does as a therapy) and to partner with her in an upcoming dance competition. He reluctantly agrees and the two begin a rigorous practice regimen over the following weeks. Even Danny comes to help but when he does Pat starts to get jealous and shows a bit of affection for Tiffany but tries to push it away. Pat believes the competition will be a good way to show Nikki that he has changed and become a better person.The elder Patrizio hopes to open his own restaurant and has resorted to illegal bookmaking. Having bet virtually all of his money on the outcome of a Philadelphia Eagles game, he asks Pat to attend as a ""good-luck charm"". Pat asks Tiffany for time off from practice to attend the game. She gives him a typed reply from Nikki, in which she cautiously hints there may be a chance for reconciliation between them. Before he gets into the stadium, Pat gets involved in a fight when some racist fans harass the Indian fans there including his therapist Dr. Patel, and is hauled away by the police. The Eagles lose the game and Patrizio is furious. Tiffany shows up at their house and points out that the way she is ""reading the signs,"" Philadelphia teams do better when she and Pat are together. Convinced, Patrizio makes a parlay with his gambling friend: if the Eagles win their next game and Tiffany and Pat score 5 out of 10 in their dance competition, he will win back double the money he lost on the first bet. Pat is reluctant, and Tiffany, Dolores, and Patrizio conspire to persuade Pat to dance in the competition by telling him that Nikki will be there; it is revealed that his parents have secretly supported Tiffanys attempts to get along with him. Pat notices that the letter from Nikki also refers to ""reading the signs"" and realizes that Tiffany wrote it.Tiffany, Pat, and their friends and family arrive at the competition on the night of the football game. Tiffany despairs when she finds that Nikki actually is in the audience, invited by Ronnie and Veronica who want Nikki to lift her restraining order on Pat and give Pat the chance to reconcile with her. Tiffany walks to the bar and starts drinking. Pat finds her moments before their dance and drags her onto the dance floor. They begin their routine as the Eagles defeat the Dallas Cowboys. At the conclusion of their set, Tiffany and Pat score exactly 5 points. Amid cheers from friends and family and confused looks from the crowd, Pat approaches Nikki and speaks quietly into her ear. Tiffany sees this and runs off. Pat leaves Nikki behind after a short conversation, and chases Tiffany. He hands her a letter, in which he admits that he knows she forged Nikkis letter and confesses that he loved her from the moment he met her, though it took him so long to come to terms with it. They share a kiss. Patrizio opens a restaurant with the money he has won, Danny grows even closer to the Solitanos, and Pat and Tiffany begin a relationship, no longer wearing their wedding rings.",21000000,"[{""id"": 18, ""name"": ""Drama""}, {""id"": 35, ""name"": ""Comedy""}, {""id"": 10749, ""name"": ""Romance""}]",http://silverliningsplaybookmovie.com/,82693,"[{""id"": 246, ""name"": ""dancing""}, {""id"": 276, ""name"": ""philadelphia""}, {""id"": 795, ""name"": ""running""}, {""id"": 818, ""name"": ""based on novel""}, {""id"": 894, ""name"": ""depression""}, {""id"": 3344, ""name"": ""letter""}, {""id"": 6054, ""name"": ""friendship""}, {""id"": 10226, ""name"": ""neighbor""}, {""id"": 41329, ""name"": ""mental illness""}, {""id"": 155816, ""name"": ""ex-wife""}, {""id"": 162970, ""name"": ""institutionalization""}, {""id"": 189447, ""name"": ""bipolar""}, {""id"": 189881, ""name"": ""philadelphia eagles""}]",en,"After spending eight months in a mental institution, a former teacher moves back in with his parents and tries to reconcile with his ex-wife.",63.599973,"[{""name"": ""The Weinstein Company"", ""id"": 308}]","[{""iso_3166_1"": ""US"", ""name"": ""United States of America""}]",9/8/2012,205738714,122,"[{""iso_639_1"": ""en"", ""name"": ""English""}]",Released,Watch For The Signs,Silver Linings Playbook,6.9,4742,0.5,0.733439028,0.7169227,0.5,0.2169227,0.016516328,-0.233439028,0.155626019,9.797081619
513,514,Snow White and the Huntsman,2016,/wiki/Snow_White_and_the_Huntsman,"While admiring a rose blooming in the winter, Queen Eleanor of the kingdom of Tabor pricks her finger on one of its thorns. Three drops of blood fall onto the snow-covered ground, and she wishes for a daughter as white as the snow, with lips as red as the blood, hair as black as a ravens wings and a heart as strong and defiant as the rose. Queen Eleanor gives birth to her daughter, Snow White, but falls ill and dies several years later. After her death, Snow Whites father, King Magnus, and his army battle an invading dark army of demonic glass soldiers. Upon rescuing their prisoner Ravenna, the King becomes enchanted with her beauty and marries her.Ravenna is in fact a powerful sorceress and the Dark Armys master. On their wedding night, Ravenna confesses there was a king much like Magnus that hurt her. She declares she cannot be a weak queen and kills Magnus before unleashing her invading army upon the kingdom. Snow Whites childhood friend William and his father, Duke Hammond, escape the castle but are unable to rescue her, and she is captured by Ravennas brother Finn and locked away in the north tower of the castle for many years.Tabor is ruined under Queen Ravennas rule as she periodically drains the youth from the kingdoms young women in order to maintain a spell, cast over her as a child by her mother, which allows her to keep her youthful beauty. When Snow White comes of age, Ravenna learns from her Magic Mirror that her stepdaughter Snow White is destined to destroy her unless the Queen consumes the young girls heart, which will make her truly immortal. Queen Ravenna orders Finn to bring her Snow Whites heart, but Snow White escapes into the Dark Forest, where Ravenna has no power. Ravenna makes a bargain with Eric the Huntsman, a widower and drunkard, to capture Snow White, promising to bring his wife back to life in exchange. The Huntsman tracks down Snow White, but when Finn reveals that Queen Ravenna does not actually have the power to revive the dead, the Huntsman helps Snow White escape. Meanwhile, Finn gathers another band of men to find her, and the Duke and his son William learn that she is alive. William leaves the castle on his own to find her, joining Finns band as a bowman.The Huntsman and Snow White leave the Dark Forest, where she saves his life by charming a huge troll that attacks them. They make their way to a fishing village populated by women who have disfigured themselves to make themselves useless to the Queen. While there, the Huntsman learns Snow Whites true identity, and initially leaves her in the care of the women. He soon returns when he sees the village being burned down by Finns men. Snow White and the Huntsman evade them and eventually meet a band of eight dwarves. The blind dwarf Muir perceives that Snow White is the daughter of the former king, and the only person who can defeat Ravenna and end her reign.As they travel through a fairy sanctuary, Snow White encounters a White Hart, but as Snow White approaches the deer, the group is attacked by Finn and his men. A battle ensues during which one of the dwarfs, Gus, and Finn and his men are killed, while William reveals himself. William joins the group which continues the journey to Hammonds castle.Halfway to Duke Hammonds castle, Queen Ravenna disguises herself as William and tempts Snow White into eating a poisoned apple, but is forced to flee when the Huntsman and William discover her. William kisses Snow White, whose body is taken to Hammonds castle. As she lies in repose, the Huntsman professes his regret for not saving Snow White, who reminds him of his late wife, Sara; and he kisses her. The spell broken, Snow White awakens and walks into the courtyard; rallying the Dukes army to mount a siege against Queen Ravenna.The dwarves infiltrate the castle through the sewers and open the gates, allowing the Dukes army inside. Snow White confronts Queen Ravenna, but is overpowered. Queen Ravenna is about to kill Snow White and consume her heart. Eventually, Snow White uses a move the Huntsman taught her and mortally wounds Queen Ravenna, and Duke Hammonds army is victorious.

514,515,Solitary Man,2010,/wiki/Solitary_Man_(film),"The film opens with 54-year-old Ben Kalmen (Michael Douglas), an attractive and very successful car dealer in the New York area, at his annual medical check-up; his doctor tells him he needs a CAT scan to get a better look at his heart, due to an ""irregularity"" in his EKG.About six years later, Bens fortunes have drastically changed. He is taking oral medications but never got the prescribed heart tests, and his lost sense of ""immortality"" has sent him on a self-destructive binge: habitual lying, inappropriate sexual affairs, divorce, and bad business decisions that nearly put him in prison. He is broke, borrowing money from his daughter Susan (Jenna Fischer), and still unwilling to accept his age, ignoring his heart problem, and has a serial sexual appetite.Ben, who cheated often on his wife Nancy Kalmen (Susan Sarandon), accompanies Allyson (Imogen Poots), the 18-year-old daughter of his girlfriend, Jordan Karsch (Mary-Louise Parker), to her college interview at a Boston college campus where Ben is an alumnus, having been a prominent donor during his more prosperous days. On campus, Ben meets an impressionable student named Daniel (Jesse Eisenberg) who appreciates his wisdom and advice. Later that night, Ben and Allyson sleep together. Back in New York, Ben expresses a desire to continue the relationship, which Allyson dismisses as a one time experiment with an older man, in her words, crossing ""the Daddy"" fantasy off her ""list"". Frustrated with Ben and her own mother, Allyson dismissively tells her mother about the sexual encounter. Jordan is incensed and breaks off contact with Ben. She then withdraws the support Ben needs to open a new auto dealership. While discussing his overdue rent with his building manager (Lenny Venito), his daughter Susan appears and tells him he is no longer welcome in her familys life. She tells him that this is because of his inconsistency and unreliability as the grandfather of her son and after discovering another inappropriate affair Ben had with her friend.Facing eviction, Ben asks his college friend Jimmy Marino (Danny DeVito) to give him a job at his campus diner. Allyson, now a student, discovers Ben working near her. Ben receives a call from Jordan demanding he leave town immediately and threatening if he does not that she will have Allysons fathers connections persuade him to do so with physical force. At a college party cruising, Ben recognizes a customer from the diner then makes a sexual advance toward Daniels new girlfriend, Maureen (Olivia Thirlby). Shortly after the girl rebuffs him, he is severely beaten by an ex-police officer (Arthur J. Nascarella) sent by Jordan who heads up Allysons fathers security team.After discussing his view of life with Jimmy, Ben collapses and wakes up in a hospital with Susan at his bedside. Ben then leaves the hospital against medical advice. He apologizes to Daniel for his indiscretion and discovers Nancy on the bench where they met. Nancy has learned of Bens medical condition and appears to struggle with the fact that his illness has caused the pattern of self-destructive behavior in his strange behavior. Ben tells Nancy that aging and the prospect of dying caused him to feel ""invisible"", so he decided to plunge into life with full gusto. She tells him thats no excuse, but she understands and offers him a ride back to New York City. The film ends with Nancy waiting in the car for his decision and a young woman walking by Ben, still sitting on the bench, in the opposite direction. Ben looks one way at Nancy, then the other way at the woman.

517,518,Soul Surfer,2011,/wiki/Soul_Surfer_(film),"In 2003, teenager Bethany Hamilton lives in Kauai, Hawaii with her parents Tom and Cheri, and two brothers, Noah and Timmy. All are surfers, but she and her best friend Alana Blanchard have grown up with a passion for the sport and enter a competition. Her church youth ministry leader, Sarah Hill, is disappointed when she has to withdraw from a planned mission trip to Mexico because of the contest.In the competition, Bethany and Alana place first and third, respectively. A few days later, Tom goes to the hospital for knee surgery, and the girls go surfing with Alanas father Holt and brother Byron. As Bethany dangles her left arm in the water, a tiger shark notices her arm floating in the water. The shark unexpectedly attacks, taking away her arm below the shoulder. Holt, Alana, and Byron get her out of the water where Holt makes a tourniquet out of his swimshirt to put on her while Byron calls 911 as Cheri is also informed. An ambulance meets them on the way to the hospital. Just before starting Toms knee surgery, Dr. David Rovinsky is called to the emergency room to treat Bethany. Besides losing her left arm, she also lost 60% of her blood and Dr. Rovinsky calls her survival a miracle.The onslaught of paparazzi also proves to be a great strain on her family and their privacy. The Hamiltons are grateful to Holt for his quick and active thinking and decisive action that saved her life. Her injury prevents her from participating in the Rip Curl photo shoots, but she wishes Alana well.Bethany perseveres and after a recuperation period, gets back in the water, and learns to surf with one arm. Inside Edition offers to provide a prosthetic one that is cosmetically perfect and has bendable joints, in exchange for an interview. She angrily rejects it when she learns it will not help her surf as it is not weight bearing, as a result of the size of her arm stump.Bethany eventually re-enters the competition, telling rival Malina not to go easy on her, and rejects a five-minute head start offered by the judges. She does not perform well because she cannot stay on the board long enough to go out and catch a competitive wave so Malina wins. Disappointed at this loss, she decides to give up competitive surfing and her friendship with Alana is strained following an argument.Bethany decides to surprise Sarah by joining the youth group on another mission trip to help the people of Phuket, Thailand who were devastated by the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. Despite her recent tragedy, she joins her youth group to help the Thai children get over their fear of the ocean. They are understandably afraid of the water, including a little boy. She decides to go into it with a surfboard, hoping this will coax him into it. It works, and the realization that she can use her gift to inspire people motivates her to take up surfing again.Tom, who believes that Bethany possesses a great surfers instinct for sensing when the best waves will form, rigs a handle on her surfboard which she can use to prevent falling off while paddling out to the waves, which is not prohibited by the competitions rules. Bethany trains for the competition while rekindling her friendship with Alana. She enters the national championship. During the competition, she performs respectably, though she is still chasing third place. Suddenly, with only minutes left on the clock, the waves die down and all the surfers can only loiter, waiting for the waves to start back up. Toms belief in his daughters instinct is proven when she is the only one to sense a big wave forming, and she alone paddles out. When it forms, the others cannot get out in time and she catches it just as the horn sounds. If it is in time, she will win, but the judges rule that the time has expired. Malina is the winner, but she has finally gotten over her differences with Bethany, inviting her up on the platform to share first place.Subsequently, Bethany lets the reporters interview her. One asks her what she would do if given the chance to undo the loss of her arm.

518,519,Source Code,2011,/wiki/Source_Code,"U.S. Army pilot Captain Colter Stevens wakes up on a Metra commuter train headed to Chicago. Stevens is disoriented, his last memory before that was being on a mission in Afghanistan.  To the world around him – including his traveling partner Christina Warren and the bathroom mirror – Stevens appears to be Sean Fentress, a school teacher. As he comes to grips with this revelation, the train explodes, killing everyone aboard.Stevens regains consciousness inside a dimly lit cockpit. Communicating through a video screen, Air Force Captain Colleen Goodwin verifies Stevens identity and insists he stay ""on mission"" to find the train bomber before a second bomb hits downtown Chicago in six hours. Stevens is inside the ""Source Code"", an experimental device designed by scientist Dr. Rutledge.  In the machine he experiences the last eight minutes of another compatible persons life within an alternative timeline.Stevens is unwillingly sent back into the Source Code repeatedly in frustrating, exhausting attempts to learn the bombers identity. He tries to warn authorities on the train and flee with Christina, escaping the explosion. Other times, he cannot locate or disarm the bomb in time and dies on the train. Later, Stevens learns that he has been with them for two months since being reported killed in action in Afghanistan.  In real life he is comatose and is missing most of his body, he is on life support while hooked up to neural sensors. The cockpit capsule is a projection of his brain as it attempts to make sense of a missing environment. Angry at learning that he is on life support, he asks to be disconnected after the mission and Rutledge agrees.Stevens finally catches the bomber, a man named Derek Frost.  Frost leaves his wallet behind to fake his own death and gets off at the last stop before Chicago. In their first encounter, Frost kills both Stevens and Christina and flees in a rented white van with a dirty bomb in it. Stevens remembers the license number and direction and reports it to Rutledge when he returns from the Source Code.  The authorities use the information to catch Frost, preventing him from detonating the dirty bomb. Rutledge reneges on his promise to let Stevens die and orders Goodwin to wipe Stevens memory for a future mission. Stevens convinces Goodwin to allow him one more trip back to the train so that he can try to save everyone, despite Rutledges insistence that events could not be altered.Stevens is sent back into the Source Code where he asks Christina to go out for coffee with him.

519,520,Spider-Man 2,2015,/wiki/Spider-Man_2,"Peter Parker, secretly the superhero Spider-Man, is estranged from both love interest Mary Jane Watson and best friend Harry Osborn, and additionally discovers his Aunt May is facing eviction. He also finds himself suffering temporary, but reoccurring losses of his powers, often in life-threatening situations.Harry, now head of Oscorps genetic and scientific research division, is sponsoring a fusion power project by nuclear scientist Otto Octavius, who befriends and mentors Peter. While handling hazardous materials, Octavius wears a harness of powerful robotic tentacle arms with artificial intelligence. During a public demonstration that Peter and Harry attend, a power spike causes the fusion reactor to destabilize. Octavius refuses to shut down the reactor, which goes critical — killing his wife and burning the inhibitor chip blocking the arms from his nervous system. Peter shuts the experiment down, destroying it in the process.At a hospital, doctors prepare to surgically remove Octavius harness. However, without the inhibitor chip the arms have developed sentience and attack them. Upon regaining consciousness and seeing the carnage, Octavius escapes and takes refuge at a harbor. Becoming increasingly influenced by the arms AI, he robs a bank in order to fund a second experiment. Peter and May coincidentally are there, and   Octavius takes May hostage. Peter rescues her, but Octavius flees with stolen money. The Daily Bugle subsequently dubs the scientist Doctor Octopus.Mary Jane becomes engaged to astronaut John Jameson, son of Bugle publisher J. Jonah Jameson. Peter suffers an emotional breakdown over his inability to balance his life, resulting in him losing his powers. He abandons his Spider-Man identity, returns to his normal life, and attempts to reconcile with Mary Jane. A garbageman brings Peters Spider-Man costume to Jameson, who takes credit for driving Spider-Man into hiding. Peter tells May the truth behind his Uncle Bens death and how he is responsible. May forgives him, but the rise in New York City crime rates worries Peter.Requiring the isotope tritium to fuel his reactor, Octavius visits Harry to demand it. Harry agrees in exchange for Spider-Man, whom he believes is responsible for the death of his father Norman Osborn. He tells Octavius to seek Peter, who Harry believes is friends with Spider-Man, but tells Octavius not to harm him. Octavius locates Peter, tells him to find Spider-Man, and captures Mary Jane. Her endangerment leads to Peters powers resurfacing. Just as Jameson admits he was wrong about Spider-Man, Peter steals his costume back from the Bugle and goes after Octavius.As Peter battles Octavius, they fall onto a New York City Subway train. Octavius sabotages the controls and leaves Peter to save the passengers, which he does at a great physical toll. When he faints from exhaustion, the grateful passengers save him from falling and bring him into the train, seeing his unmasked face but promising to keep their knowledge hidden. In vain, they try to protect him when Octavius returns to capture Peter, whom Octavius delivers to Harry.After giving Octavius the tritium, Harry prepares to kill Spider-Man, only to be shocked to see Peter under the mask. Peter convinces Harry to direct him to Octavius lair, as bigger things are at stake. As Spider-Man, he arrives at the doctors waterfront laboratory and attempts to rescue Mary Jane discreetly. Octavius discovers him and they fight once again as the nuclear reaction swells. Peter ultimately subdues Octavius, reveals his identity, and persuades Octavius to let his dream go for the greater good. Octavius finally commands the tentacles to obey him, and gives his life to destroy the experiment. Mary Jane sees Spider-Mans true identity and feelings, which he says is why they cannot be together. Peter returns Mary Jane to John, and leaves.Harry is visited by a vision of his father in a mirror, pleading for Harry to avenge his death. Refusing to hurt Peter, Harry shatters the mirror, unintentionally revealing a secret room containing prototypes of the Green Goblins equipment. On her wedding day, Mary Jane abandons John at the altar and runs to Peters apartment.

520,521,Splice,2010,/wiki/Splice_(film),"Genetic engineers Clive Nicoli and Elsa Kast hope to achieve fame by splicing animal DNA to create hybrids for medical use at the company N.E.R.D. (Nucleic Exchange Research and Development). Their work previously yielded Fred, a dog-sized vermiform creature intended as a mate for their female specimen, Ginger. After successfully mating them, Clive and Elsa plan to create a human-animal hybrid that could revolutionize science. Their employers Joan Chorot of N.E.R.D. and William Barlow forbid them from doing this. Instead, they are to find and extract proteins used for commercial drug production from Fred and Ginger. Clive and Elsa, however, disobey their superiors and pursue their own agenda in secret, developing a viable prepubescent female creature.Although they had planned to terminate the hybrid before it reached full term, Elsa persuades Clive to let it live. They discover that she is aging at a vastly accelerated rate. Elsa discovers that the creature is undergoing mental development such as that of a young human child. Elsa names the creature ""Dren"" after the creature spells out NERD, having seen the letters on Elsas shirt.After moving Dren to a new location for fear of discovery, they find she has a dangerously high fever. In an attempt to save her they place her in a large industrial sink filled with cold water. Later on Clive fully submerges Dren in the sink, and in doing so discovers that Dren is amphibious, but remains ambiguous in whether he tried to save Dren or kill her.While studying Dren, Elsa and Clive neglect their work with Fred and Ginger. At a highly publicized presentation of their work, Fred and Ginger savagely fight to the death. It is subsequently discovered that Ginger had spontaneously changed to a male, but Elsa and Clive failed to notice because they were focused on Dren.Elsa forms a motherly bond with Dren. After Dren jumps on Clives brother, Gavin, they move her to an isolated farm. There, Dren displays carnivorous tendencies and retractable wings. She grows into adolescence and becomes bored with being locked up in the barn, but Elsa and Clive fear that letting her outside might lead to her discovery. Clive realizes that the human DNA used to create Dren was Elsas, not from an anonymous donor as Elsa had told him. After Dren exhibits dangerous misbehavior Elsa restrains Dren and removes her stinger, using it to synthesize the protein that Elsa and Clive had been searching for.Meanwhile, Dren and Clive have developed a mutual attraction. Elsa discovers them having sex in the barn and is horrified. Clive accuses Elsa of never having wanted a ""normal"" child because of her fear of losing control; instead she chose to raise one as an experiment, where control could be assured. Deciding the only solution is to terminate Dren, they return to the farm and find Dren seemingly already dying.William Barlow discovers human DNA in Drens protein samples and arrives to investigate. Elsa tells Barlow that Dren is dead and buried behind the barn. However, Dren, having metamorphosed into a male, rises from the grave and attacks the group, killing Barlow and Gavin before raping Elsa.  Clive attacks Dren to save Elsa, but Dren overpowers him.  Elsa intervenes and is about to kill Dren, but she hesitates, which allows Dren to kill Clive.  Elsa then kills Dren.Elsa is later informed that Drens body contained numerous biochemical compounds for which the company  begun filing patents.

She confronts Charlie, who explains the truth: Charlie murdered his and Richards younger brother Jonathan as a child by burying him alive in a sandbox because he was jealous that Richard paid more attention to him. He was then put in a mental institution. When released on Indias 18th birthday, Richard gives Charlie a car, money, and an apartment in New York City on the condition that he stay away from Richards family. Feeling hurt and betrayed, Charlie beat Richard to death with a rock and staged the car accident.At first, India is in shock and angered but Charlie explains he has come for her then gives her a birthday present, a pair of stiletto heels. She seemingly forgives Charlie and grows closer after he provides an alibi for her when Sheriff Howard (Ralph Brown) questions her about Whips disappearance. They grow close to intimate before Evelyn witnesses them. Charlie proceeds to tell India that he wants her to come to New York with him and that he had waited for her until her 18th birthday so she is now of age. Later, Evelyn coldly expresses her desire to watch India suffer before confronting Charlie, implying that she knows the truth about Richards death and Charlies stint in the mental institute. Charlie seduces Evelyn and then attempts to strangle her with a belt before India fatally shoots him with a rifle. She then buries Charlies body in the backyard and then she leaves for New York in his car.She is pulled over for speeding by Sheriff Howard, who asks her why shes in a hurry. India replies that she wanted to catch his attention, then plunges a pair of pruning shears into his neck.

526,527,Straight Outta Compton,2015,/wiki/Straight_Outta_Compton_(2015_film),"In 1986 Compton, California, Eazy-E is a drug dealer, Dr. Dre is an aspiring disc jockey, and Ice Cube is a rapper. Intrigued by Cubes ""reality raps"" reflecting on the crime, gang violence, and police harassment that they and other African Americans encounter daily, Dre convinces Eazy to fund a startup record label, Ruthless Records, with Dre as record producer. When their song ""Boyz-n-the-Hood"" is rejected by a New York rap group, Dre convinces Eazy to instead perform it himself. It becomes a local hit, so Eazy, Cube, Dre, along with DJ Yella and MC Ren, form the group N.W.A (""Niggaz Wit Attitudes"").Eazy accepts Jerry Hellers offer to manage N.W.A and co-run Ruthless Records, and Priority Records offers N.W.A a record deal. Whilst recording their debut album, Straight Outta Compton, the group is harassed by police, prompting Ice Cube to tab the song ""Fuck tha Police"". The album becomes a controversial hit due to its explicit lyrics, and the groups style is dubbed gangsta rap by the press. During a 1989 concert tour, the FBI demands that N.W.A should stop performing ""Fuck tha Police"", claiming that it causes defamation against law enforcement. Police in Detroit forbid them to perform it, and a riot breaks out when they ignore their request and perform it anyway.Jerry delays the individual members contracts with Ruthless, and when he insists that Cube should sign without legal representation, Cube leaves the group. His debut solo album, AmeriKKKas Most Wanted, is released in May 1990, but when Priority Records is unable to pay him his advance on his next album, he trashes the label heads office. When N.W.A diss Cube on their next record, 100 Miles and Runnin, he responds with ""No Vaseline"" the following year, dissing Heller and his former bandmates, and prompting accusations of antisemitism. Combined with his association with the Nation of Islam, outspoken criticism of the Los Angeles Police Department in the wake of the beating of Rodney King, and starring role in the 1991 film Boyz n the Hood, Cube becomes more famous and controversial than ever.Dr. Dre hires Suge Knight as his manager, through whom he learns that Heller has been underpaying him. He leaves N.W.A to co-found Death Row Records with Knight, who has his thugs threaten Heller and beat up Eazy to pressure them into releasing Dr. Dre from his contract with Ruthless Records. Dre enjoys his newfound creative freedom and works with other rappers, including Snoop Dogg and Tupac Shakur. His debut solo album, The Chronic (1992), sells over 5,000,000 copies, but he is disturbed by Suges violent behavior, and the community is ravaged by recent riots.Eazy, whose fortunes and health have declined, learns that Heller has embezzled money from Ruthless and fires him. He rekindles his friendships with Cube and Dre, who agree to an N.W.A reunion. However, before recording can begin, Eazy collapses in the recording studio, and is diagnosed with HIV/AIDS. Amid emotional visits from his friends, Eazy dies on March 26, 1995, and is mourned by fans. A year later, Dre parts ways with Suge Knight and Death Row Records to found his own label, Aftermath Entertainment. As the credits roll, the eventual successes of Aftermath are revealed up to the present day, along with the new generation of rappers who were influenced by both the music of Ruthless and Death Row Records.",28000000,"[{""id"": 18, ""name"": ""Drama""}, {""id"": 10402, ""name"": ""Music""}]",http://www.straightouttacompton.com/,277216,"[{""id"": 380, ""name"": ""brother brother relationship""}, {""id"": 740, ""name"": ""aids""}, {""id"": 796, ""name"": ""police brutality""}, {""id"": 897, ""name"": ""rap music""}, {""id"": 898, ""name"": ""hip-hop""}, {""id"": 1157, ""name"": ""wife husband relationship""}, {""id"": 2016, ""name"": ""vandalism""}, {""id"": 2231, ""name"": ""drug dealer""}, {""id"": 2334, ""name"": ""nightclub""}, {""id"": 2930, ""name"": ""freedom of speech""}, {""id"": 4108, ""name"": ""protest""}, {""id"": 4562, ""name"": ""rapper""}, {""id"": 4741, ""name"": ""recording contract""}, {""id"": 5626, ""name"": ""from rags to riches""}, {""id"": 6093, ""name"": ""assault""}, {""id"": 6564, ""name"": ""terminal illness""}, {""id"": 7312, ""name"": ""road trip""}, {""id"": 9672, ""name"": ""based on true story""}, {""id"": 9932, ""name"": ""feud""}, {""id"": 10726, ""name"": ""gang""}, {""id"": 10776, ""name"": ""marijuana""}, {""id"": 11148, ""name"": ""police chase""}, {""id"": 11612, ""name"": ""hospital""}, {""id"": 12425, ""name"": ""racism""}, {""id"": 12670, ""name"": ""los angeles""}, {""id"": 13142, ""name"": ""gangster""}, {""id"": 156158, ""name"": ""racial slur""}, {""id"": 157499, ""name"": ""mother son relationship""}, {""id"": 158111, ""name"": ""no opening credits""}, {""id"": 160497, ""name"": ""wrongful arrest""}, {""id"": 163764, ""name"": ""death of brother""}, {""id"": 169213, ""name"": ""milwaukee wisconsin""}, {""id"": 169590, ""name"": ""police raid""}, {""id"": 178036, ""name"": ""police harassment""}, {""id"": 178929, ""name"": ""detroit michigan""}, {""id"": 179431, ""name"": ""duringcreditsstinger""}, {""id"": 187903, ""name"": ""gangster rap""}, {""id"": 195162, ""name"": ""record company""}, {""id"": 208289, ""name"": ""1980s""}, {""id"": 217467, ""name"": ""music tour""}, {""id"": 217469, ""name"": ""reference to rodney king""}, {""id"": 217474, ""name"": ""intimidation by police""}, {""id"": 217475, ""name"": ""los angeles riots""}, {""id"": 217482, ""name"": ""compton california""}]",en,"In 1987, five young men, using brutally honest rhymes and hardcore beats, put their frustration and anger about life in the most dangerous place in America into the most powerful weapon they had: their music.

527,528,Straw Dogs,2011,/wiki/Straw_Dogs_(2011_film),"Scriptwriter David Sumner (James Marsden) and his wife Amy (Kate Bosworth) relocate to rural Mississippi where Amy grew up. They are going to live in the house of Amys recently deceased father and to allow David to finish a script.While in town one afternoon, David meets Amys ex-boyfriend Charlie (Alexander Skarsgård) and his three friends, Norman (Rhys Coiro), Chris (Billy Lush), and Bic (Drew Powell). David is intimidated by the men, but they have already been hired to fix the roof of the barn on Amys property. He also meets Tom Heddon (James Woods), a former high school football coach whose 15-year-old daughter Janice (Willa Holland) is attracted to a local man with an intellectual disability, Jeremy Niles (Dominic Purcell). Heddon often bullies Jeremy, and believes that he is stalking his daughter.Charlie and his friends arrive early the next morning to work on the roof. They taunt David, which later escalates into harassment. They also make crude remarks towards Amy and play their music loud to distract David while he writes. They often leave early when they want to go hunting, which concerns David because it is taking them forever to finish the roof. One Sunday after church, Heddon attacks Jeremy for talking to Janice, and Amy comes to his defense, but David warns her to not get involved. Later that night back at home, David discovers their cat strangled and hung up in the bedroom closet. Amy is positive that Charlie and his friends are to blame as they disappeared from the church barbeque for a few hours earlier, but David is hesitant to confront them. When he does finally question them, the men deny everything.Charlie invites David to go deer hunting. While David is out in the woods with two of the men, Charlie goes back to the house and pushes his way inside to confront Amy, because he is sure that she still wants him. He throws her onto the couch and forces her to have sex with him. Afterwards, he realizes that Amy did not want this, and is stunned. Norman arrives, holds Amy across the top of the couch, and also rapes her while Charlie watches. Then they leave. When David returns, Amy is upset but she does not tell him what happened. Instead, she encourages David to get rid of Charlie and his men and fire them. The next day David tells Charlie that fixing the roof is taking too long. Charlie insists that they have already paid for the roofing supplies, which David agrees to pay for. Finally, Charlie and his cronies leave, celebrating their $5000 payday.David and Amy go to a local football game. Cheerleader Janice lures Jeremy to enter an empty locker room. Heddon notices that his daughter is missing from the game and goes in search of her. Meanwhile, Janice tries to convince Jeremy to let her give him oral sex. They hear Heddon calling for Janice. Afraid of Heddon finding them, Jeremy holds Janice tight against his body with his hand over her mouth and nose, accidentally smothering her to death. Horrified, he runs away from the school. Heddon goes back to tell Charlie and his friends that Janice is missing. They all suspect that Jeremy has done something to her.At the game, Amy has haunting flashbacks about the rapes and asks David to take her home. On the way, she tells him that she wants to return to Los Angeles, surprising him and causing him to accidentally run over Jeremy who is standing in the road. David and Amy take him back to their home and call an ambulance. Charlie and Norman overhear the ambulance call on a police scanner and inform Heddon. They all drive to David and Amys house and demand that the couple hand Jeremy over, but David refuses. The sheriff arrives shortly thereafter and tries to calm down the situation. He knocks on the door and tells David to open the door, but David still refuses. Heddon picks up his gun again and shoots the sheriff dead. Having witnessed the murder, David knows now that the men will try to kill not only Jeremy but both of them too. David and Amy barricade the doors shut. He enlists her to help him open the jaws of a decorative bear trap. Then he sends Amy upstairs with Jeremy. David looks frantically for something he can use in the house to fight off the men.When Chris attempts to enter through a window, David nails his hands to the wall with a nail gun, his throat fatally exposed to broken glass. When Heddon tries to follow, David burns his face with hot oil. Heddon and Charlie use the pick-up truck to ram into the house, but Charlie is knocked unconscious. David fights Heddon off and causes him to shoot himself in the foot. David then shoots Heddon and beats Bic to death with a fireplace poker. Upstairs, Amy and Jeremy are attacked by Norman, who has climbed in through the window. Norman is attempting to rape Amy again when David and Charlie appear. Charlie and Norman draw on each other when Norman threatens to kill Amy. Amy shoots Norman, Charlie assaults and disarms her, then David jumps him. Charlie kicks David down the stairs and beats him severely. While David lies prostrate on the floor, disarmed, Charlie prepares to shoot him in his head when Amy approaches from behind, pointing the gun at him. Turning to her, Charlie informs her the gun is empty, and says to her, ""I will always protect you, baby,"" when David rises behind him and slams the open bear trap down on his head, which shuts and ensnares him.

528,529,Sucker Punch,2011,/wiki/Sucker_Punch_(2011_film),"In the 1960s, a young woman nicknamed Babydoll (Emily Browning) is institutionalized by her abusive widowed stepfather (Gerard Plunkett) at the fictional Lennox House for the Mentally Insane in Brattleboro, Vermont, after she is blamed for her younger sisters death. The stepfather bribes Blue Jones (Oscar Isaac), an asylum orderly, into forging the signature of the asylums psychiatrist, Dr. Vera Gorski (Carla Gugino), to have Babydoll lobotomized so she cannot inform the authorities of the true circumstances leading to her sisters death. During her admission to the institution, Babydoll takes note of four items that she would need to attempt an escape.Babydoll slips into a fantasy world in which she is newly arrived in a brothel owned by Blue, whom she envisions as a mobster, where she and the other patients are sex slaves. In this realm, she befriends four other dancers – Amber (Jamie Chung), Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens), Rocket (Jena Malone), and Rockets sister and ""star of the show"", Sweet Pea (Abbie Cornish). Dr. Gorski is envisioned as the girls dance instructor. Blue informs Babydoll that her virginity will be sold to a client known as the High Roller (Jon Hamm), who is actually the doctor scheduled to perform the lobotomy. Gorski encourages Babydoll to perform an erotic dance, during which Babydoll further fantasizes she is in feudal Japan, meeting the Wise Man (Scott Glenn). After she expresses her desire to ""escape"", the Wise Man presents Babydoll with weapons and tells her that she would need to collect five items: a map, fire, a knife, a key, and a fifth, unrevealed item that would require ""a deep sacrifice"" but bring a ""perfect victory"". She then fights three samurai giants. As her fantasy ends, she finds herself back in the brothel, her dance having impressed Blue and other onlookers.Babydoll convinces the four girls to join her in preparing an escape. She plans to use her dances as a distraction while the other girls obtain the necessary tools. During her dances, she imagines fantastic adventures that mirror the escape efforts. These adventures include infiltrating a bunker protected by steampunk-inspired World War I German soldiers to gain a map (mirrored by Sweet Pea copying a map of the brothel/institution from Blues office); storming an Orc-infested castle to retrieve two fire-producing crystals from inside a baby dragon (mirrored by Amber stealing a lighter from the mayors pocket); and boarding a train and fighting robotic guards to disarm a bomb (mirrored by Sweet Pea stealing a kitchen knife from the Cooks belt). During the last fantasy, Rocket sacrifices herself to save Sweet Pea and is killed when the bomb detonates, which is paralleled by the Cook fatally stabbing Rocket while she tries to protect her sister.Blue overhears Blondie relaying Babydolls plan to Gorski, confirming his suspicions that something is amiss. He has Sweet Pea locked in a utility closet and confronts the other girls backstage. He shoots Amber and Blondie and attempts to rape Babydoll, but she stabs him with the kitchen knife and steals his master key. Babydoll frees Sweet Pea and starts a fire to keep the orderlies occupied while they look for an exit. They escape into the courtyard, where they find a throng of men blocking their way. Babydoll deduces that the fifth item needed for the escape is in fact her own sacrifice. She concludes that this is actually Sweet Peas story. Despite Sweet Peas protests, she insists on revealing herself to the visitors, thus distracting them long enough to allow her friend to slip away unnoticed.Back in the asylum, the surgeon has just performed Babydolls lobotomy. Gorski notes earlier that the girl, during her short stay, stabbed an orderly, started a fire, and helped another girl escape the asylum. The surgeon is baffled by Babydolls expression, and asks Gorski why she authorized the procedure. Gorski realizes that Blue has forged her signature and summons the police, who apprehend Blue as he attempts to sexually assault a lobotomized Babydoll. While being led away, Blue also incriminates the stepfather. Babydoll is shown smiling serenely, having apparently found freedom within her own inner ""Paradise"".At a bus station, Sweet Pea is stopped by police as she tries to get on a bus to Fort Wayne, but she is rescued by the bus driver (the Wise Man), who misleads the police and allows her to board. Sweet Pea thanks the Driver, who tells her they have ""a very long way to go"". During the end credits, Dr. Gorski and Blue perform ""Love Is the Drug"" in a glitzy musical sequence that includes all five female leads.Deleted extended endingIn a deleted scene, Sweet Pea is shown stealing clothes from a nearby farm. Babydoll, meanwhile, wakes up after being knocked out by the guard in High Rollers residence. The High Roller explains that he and Babydoll are supposed to ""screw"", but that he has no intention of simply taking her. Instead, he is looking for a moment of truth in a fake world, which can only be provided by someone who is not a faker, which is why he needs Babydoll - he says he wants to see in her eyes a simple truth: that she would give herself to him willingly, not because she has to, but because she wants to. At first, Babydoll seems reluctant as the High Roller becomes more intimate, but soon starts warming up to him. The High Roller explains that in exchange for this one moment of truth, he will give her absolute freedom, as an abstract ideal. Babydoll willingly pulls him close to her, and they kiss. At this moment, Babydolls fantasy ends, and she is thrust back into the real world just as the surgeons needle enters her eye.",82000000,"[{""id"": 28, ""name"": ""Action""}, {""id"": 14, ""name"": ""Fantasy""}, {""id"": 53, ""name"": ""Thriller""}]",http://suckerpunchmovie.warnerbros.com,23629,"[{""id"": 1411, ""name"": ""brothel""}, {""id"": 2486, ""name"": ""fantasy""}, {""id"": 2884, ""name"": ""asylum""}, {""id"": 3026, ""name"": ""reality""}, {""id"": 10685, ""name"": ""escape""}, {""id"": 14544, ""name"": ""robot""}, {""id"": 14819, ""name"": ""violence""}, {""id"": 18128, ""name"": ""inmate""}, {""id"": 18677, ""name"": ""alternative""}, {""id"": 170344, ""name"": ""imagination""}, {""id"": 189400, ""name"": ""lobotomy""}]",en,"A young girl is institutionalized by her abusive stepfather.

529,530,Suicide Squad,2016,/wiki/Suicide_Squad_(film),"In the aftermath of Supermans death, intelligence officer Amanda Waller convinces Washington D.C. officials to allow her to assemble Task Force X, a team of dangerous criminals imprisoned at Belle Reve Special Security Barracks. The team consists of elite hitman Floyd Lawton, former psychiatrist Harleen Quinzel, pyrokinetic ex-gangster Chato Santana, opportunistic thief Digger Harkness, genetic mutant Waylon Jones, and specialized assassin Christopher Weiss. They are placed under command of Colonel Rick Flag to be used as disposable assets in high-risk missions for the United States government. Each member has a nanite bomb implanted in their neck, designed to detonate should any member rebel or try to escape.One of Wallers intended recruits is Flags girlfriend Dr. June Moone, an archaeologist possessed by a demonic witch known as the ""Enchantress"". She quickly turns on Waller, deciding to eradicate humankind with a mystical weapon for imprisoning her. She besieges Midway City by transforming its populace into a horde of monsters, and summons her brother Incubus to assist her. Waller then deploys the squad to extract a high-profile mark from Midway, which is reported to be under a terrorist attack. Joining them is Katana, a Japanese swordswoman.Harleys homicidal lover Joker finds out about her predicament and tortures Belle Reve security officer Griggs into leading him to the facility where the nanite bombs are made. There, he blackmails Dr. Van Criss into disabling Harleys bomb. Upon arrival, the squads helicopter is shot down, forcing them to proceed on foot to their target. Boomerang inaccurately convinces Slipknot that the bombs are a ruse to keep them in check, who attempts to escape and is killed. Meanwhile, the squad is ambushed by Enchantress minions. They eventually fight their way through to a safe house, where they learn that their mark is Waller herself, who is attempting to cover up her involvement in Enchantress siege.The squad escorts Waller to the rooftop for extraction, but the arriving helicopter has been hijacked by the Joker and his men, who open fire on the squad. Harleys bomb is disarmed by Dr. Van Criss, leaving Flag unable to execute her and allows her to climb aboard the helicopter. Wallers men subsequently shoot down the helicopter, and Harley falls out while the Joker is presumed dead, after which Harley rejoins the squad. Alerted to Wallers whereabouts, Enchantress minions arrive and kidnap her. Deadshot finds Wallers confidential files and learns the truth about Enchantress, Flag then being forced to confess the truth. This causes the squad members to abandon him. With Waller compromised, Flag relieves the squad of the mission but chooses to continue. Realizing they have an opportunity to prove themselves, they soon rejoin him and locate Enchantress at a partially-flooded subway station. Killer Croc and a group of Navy SEALs, led by Lieutenant GQ Edwards, go underwater to plant a bomb underneath Incubus. El Diablo embraces his abilities and distracts Incubus long enough for the bomb to detonate underneath, killing them both as well as Edwards.The remaining squad members battle Enchantress together but are ultimately defeated. Enchantress offers to fulfill their deepest desires in exchange for their allegiance, and Harley feigns interest in order to get close enough to cut out Enchantress heart. Killer Croc then throws explosives into Enchantress weapon and Deadshot shoots them, destroying the device. Flag takes Enchantress heart and crushes it, finally freeing June from the curse.

530,531,Suicide Squad,2016,/wiki/Suicide_Squad_(film),"In the aftermath of Supermans death, intelligence officer Amanda Waller convinces Washington D.C. officials to allow her to assemble Task Force X, a team of dangerous criminals imprisoned at Belle Reve Special Security Barracks. The team consists of elite hitman Floyd Lawton, former psychiatrist Harleen Quinzel, pyrokinetic ex-gangster Chato Santana, opportunistic thief Digger Harkness, genetic mutant Waylon Jones, and specialized assassin Christopher Weiss. They are placed under command of Colonel Rick Flag to be used as disposable assets in high-risk missions for the United States government. Each member has a nanite bomb implanted in their neck, designed to detonate should any member rebel or try to escape.One of Wallers intended recruits is Flags girlfriend Dr. June Moone, an archaeologist possessed by a demonic witch known as the ""Enchantress"". She quickly turns on Waller, deciding to eradicate humankind with a mystical weapon for imprisoning her. She besieges Midway City by transforming its populace into a horde of monsters, and summons her brother Incubus to assist her. Waller then deploys the squad to extract a high-profile mark from Midway, which is reported to be under a terrorist attack. Joining them is Katana, a Japanese swordswoman.Harleys homicidal lover Joker finds out about her predicament and tortures Belle Reve security officer Griggs into leading him to the facility where the nanite bombs are made. There, he blackmails Dr. Van Criss into disabling Harleys bomb. Upon arrival, the squads helicopter is shot down, forcing them to proceed on foot to their target. Boomerang inaccurately convinces Slipknot that the bombs are a ruse to keep them in check, who attempts to escape and is killed. Meanwhile, the squad is ambushed by Enchantress minions. They eventually fight their way through to a safe house, where they learn that their mark is Waller herself, who is attempting to cover up her involvement in Enchantress siege.The squad escorts Waller to the rooftop for extraction, but the arriving helicopter has been hijacked by the Joker and his men, who open fire on the squad. Harleys bomb is disarmed by Dr. Van Criss, leaving Flag unable to execute her and allows her to climb aboard the helicopter. Wallers men subsequently shoot down the helicopter, and Harley falls out while the Joker is presumed dead, after which Harley rejoins the squad. Alerted to Wallers whereabouts, Enchantress minions arrive and kidnap her. Deadshot finds Wallers confidential files and learns the truth about Enchantress, Flag then being forced to confess the truth. This causes the squad members to abandon him. With Waller compromised, Flag relieves the squad of the mission but chooses to continue. Realizing they have an opportunity to prove themselves, they soon rejoin him and locate Enchantress at a partially-flooded subway station. Killer Croc and a group of Navy SEALs, led by Lieutenant GQ Edwards, go underwater to plant a bomb underneath Incubus. El Diablo embraces his abilities and distracts Incubus long enough for the bomb to detonate underneath, killing them both as well as Edwards.The remaining squad members battle Enchantress together but are ultimately defeated. Enchantress offers to fulfill their deepest desires in exchange for their allegiance, and Harley feigns interest in order to get close enough to cut out Enchantress heart. Killer Croc then throws explosives into Enchantress weapon and Deadshot shoots them, destroying the device. Flag takes Enchantress heart and crushes it, finally freeing June from the curse. Waller, still alive, emerges, and the squad members are returned to Belle Reve with ten years off their sentences. All but Captain Boomerang are allowed special privileges.

531,532,Super,2011,/wiki/Super_(2010_American_film),"Short-order cook Frank Darbo recalls his only two good memories from a disappointing life: marrying his wife, Sarah, and an incident in which he directed a police officer to catch a purse snatcher. Frank immortalizes these two events in a pair of crayon drawings that he hangs on his wall for inspiration. Sarah, a recovering addict, leaves Frank for Jacques, a charismatic strip club owner who gets her hooked on drugs. Frank sinks into depression, where he has a vision in which he is touched by the finger of God and meets the Holy Avenger, a superhero from a public-access television show (based on the actual Christian superhero series, Bibleman), who tells Frank that God has chosen him for a very special purpose. Frank believes that God has chosen him to become a superhero and goes to a local comic book store for inspiration. His claim that he is designing a new superhero is met with enthusiastic appreciation from the store clerk, Libby. Frank creates a superhero costume and assumes the identity of ""The Crimson Bolt.""Armed with a pipe wrench, he begins to fight crime by delivering savage beatings to various rulebreakers, ranging from drug dealers and child molesters to a man who cuts in line at the movies. The Crimson Bolt soon becomes a media sensation. Initially, the media view him as a violent psychopath, but he begins to gain public appreciation after the criminal backgrounds of many of his victims come to light. Frank later attempts to rescue Sarah at Jacques house, but Jacques thugs recognize him under the costume and shoot him in the leg as he flees while climbing over a fence.A wounded Frank goes to Libby for help. Libby cajoles Frank into letting her become the Crimson Bolts ""kid sidekick,"" christening herself ""Boltie"" and designing a costume. She proves to be even more unhinged than Frank, using her superhero guise to nearly kill a man who possibly vandalized her friends car. Frank decides to let her go, but changes his mind when Libby rescues him from some of Jacques thugs at a gas station. Libby soon becomes enamored with Frank, but he turns down her advances, insisting that he is still married. Arguing that it is different when they are in their superhero identities, Libby rapes Frank while the two are in costume. Frank runs to the bathroom and vomits, where he encounters a vision of Sarah in the toilet. He decides that it is time to rescue her from Jacques.Armed with guns, pipe bombs, and bulletproof vests, Frank and Libby sneak into Jacques ranch, killing the first few guards they encounter. However, they are both shot. Frank is struck in the chest, his bulletproof vest sparing him, but Libby is shot in the head and killed. Devastated by her death, Frank goes into a rage, slaughtering all of Jacques thugs. Inside, Jacques shoots Frank, but Frank gains the upper hand and stabs Jacques to death as Sarah watches, horrified.Frank takes her home, and she stays for a few months ""out of a sense of obligation"" for saving her life, Frank surmises. However she leaves him again. This time, however, she manages to overcome her addiction and uses her experiences to help others with similar problems. She remarries and has four children. Frank is convinced that her children will change the world for the better. Frank, now with a pet bunny, looks on his wall of happy memories. The wall is covered with pictures of his experiences from his time spent with Libby and pictures of Sarahs kids, who call him ""Uncle Frank.""

532,533,Super 8,2011,/wiki/Super_8_(2011_film),"In 1979, Deputy Sheriff Jack Lamb of Lillian, Ohio, and his 14-year-old son Joe, mourn the death of his mother Elizabeth, who died due to an accident at work. Jack blames her co-worker, Louis Dainard, as she was covering his shift because he had a hangover. All Joe has left is a locket that belonged to her.Four months after Elizabeths funeral, Joes best friend Charles Kaznyk decides to make a low-budget zombie movie for a film competition. Charles enlists the help of Preston Scott, Martin Read, and Cary McCarthy, as well as Dainards daughter, Alice. Though their fathers would be furious, Joe and Alice become close to each other.Charles has them film a scene at a train depot at midnight. During a rehearsal, a train approaches, and Charles has them start filming as the train passes to add production value. While filming, Joe witnesses a pickup truck drive onto the tracks and ram the train, causing a massive derailment that destroys the train, the depot and the surrounding area, and separates the children from each other amidst the chaos. Joe finds himself near one container, to which the loading door is violently thrown from the carriage by an unseen force. Eventually the kids regroup and wander the wreckage. The kids investigate the wreck and find crates full of strange white cubes, then discover the trucks driver is Dr. Woodward, their biology teacher. Woodward, barely alive, warns them at gunpoint to forget what they saw that night, or else they and their parents will be killed. The children flee the scene just as a convoy from the local Air Force base, led by Col. Nelec, arrives at the scene. Nelec discovers an empty  super 8 film box, and assumes the event was purposely captured on camera.While Joe and Charles wait for their film to be developed, the town experiences strange events: All the dogs run away, several townspeople go missing, the electrical power fluctuates and electronic items from all over are stolen. Overhearing military communications, Jack approaches Nelec to address the rising panic in town, but Nelec instead orders him arrested. Nelec orders the use of flamethrowers to start wildfires outside of town, as an excuse to evacuate people to the base. Suddenly, soldiers sweep into town to begin the evacuation. Meanwhile, Joe and Charles watch the derailment footage and discover that a large creature escaped from the train.At the base, Joe learns from Alices father that she is missing, abducted by the creature following an argument between Alice and her father. Joe, Charles, Martin, and Cary convince Jen, Charles older sister, to pretend to hit on Donny in order to get into town to rescue Alice. They break into Dr. Woodwards storage trailer and discover films and documents from his time as a government researcher.They play the film, which reveals that an alien crash-landed in 1958. The Air Force captured the alien and was running experiments on it while keeping it from its ship. Woodward was one of the scientists experimenting on the ship, composed of the white cubes. At one point, the alien grabbed Woodward, apparently establishing a psychic connection with him. Now understanding the alien, he was compelled to rescue it and help it escape from Earth. He found out about the train, years later, and sought the opportunity to help the creature. The boys are caught by Nelec, but as they are taken back to base to face an unknown fate, the alien attacks their bus, tipping it over. The boys escape as the alien focuses on killing the airmen, saving Nelec for last. Meanwhile, Jack escapes from the bases brig and makes his way to the shelter housing the townsfolk. He learns from Preston about Joes plan to rescue Alice. Jack and Dainard then agree to put aside their differences to save their kids, making amends along the way.In town, the military attempts to kill the alien but find their hardware goes haywire in its presence, resulting in significant collateral damage to the town. Martin is injured in an explosion, so Charles stays behind with him while Joe and Cary head to the cemetery, where Joe had earlier seen something there that made him suspicious. Inside the cemeterys garage, they find a massive tunnel leading to a warren of underground caverns. In a chamber beneath the towns water tower, they find the alien has created a device from the towns stolen electronics, that it appears to be trying to fully activate, attached to the base of the tower. The alien also has several people, including Alice, hanging from the ceiling and unconscious, that it uses for food. Using Carys firecrackers as a distraction, Joe frees Alice and the others, but the three kids end up trapped in a dead end cavern after the alien chases them down and dispatches the others. Alice and Cary scream and cower against the tunnel wall, but Joe steps forward and tries to talk to the alien. The alien grabs Joe, who quietly speaks to the alien, telling him over and over that ""bad things happen"" but that the alien ""can still live"". After studying Joe for a moment, and then hearing its device fully activating, the alien releases him and departs, allowing the three to return to the surface.As Joe and Alice reunite with their fathers, everyone watches as numerous metal objects from all over town are pulled to the top of the water tower by an unknown force. The white cubes are also pulled in to assemble into the aliens spaceship, using the objects and the water tower as its base. As it nears completion, the alien enters the spaceship. The locket is then drawn from out of Joes pocket towards the tower and Joe, after a brief moment, decides to let it go, completing the ship. The water tank implodes and as the tower legs fall to the street, the ship rockets into space.

While working one day, Matts high school crush, Tori Frederking walks into the store. After pretending that he doesnt work there and saying that he works at Goldman Sachs in an effort to impress her, Tori invites Matt to a Labor Day party, hosted by Matts twin sister Wendys boyfriend, Kyle Masterson, at his hillside home.Later that night, Matt, Wendy, and Matts best friend, Barry Nathan (Dan Fogler), head to the party. On the drive over, Barry steals a brand new Mercedes-Benz convertible from the car dealership he got fired from earlier that day, justifying his actions by saying that Matt needs the convertible if he really wants to impress Tori. The trio arrive at the party. While there, Matt catches up with an old classmate (who actually works at Goldman Sachs) and then awkwardly tries to woo Tori. Barry snorts some cocaine he found in the glove box of the stolen convertible and gets involved in a dance-off, and Wendys boyfriend proposes to her in front of everyone at the party. She says yes, upsetting Matt, who doesnt think that Kyle will support her in her dream to attend graduate school at the University of Cambridge. Tori eventually invites Matt and Barry to another party her boss is hosting in Beverly Hills. Matt takes Tori there in the Mercedes, while Barry rides with her two friends in another car, using the cocaine as an enticement to let him go along. Barry has a wild sexual encounter with an older woman while Matt and Tori continue to mingle with each other, after Matts successful put down of Toris boss, a habitual sexual harasser. They leave the party to go into a neighbors backyard where they jump on a trampoline, play truth or dare, and end up having sex.Meanwhile, Wendy shares her unopened admissions letter from Cambridge with Kyle, and it is revealed that she was not accepted. Kyle is visibly relieved, while Wendy is visibly upset. Matt confesses to Tori that he doesnt actually work at Goldman Sachs. Tori gets extremely upset at his deception and storms off, back to her bosss party, leaving Matt guilt-ridden. Matt finds Barry there and they leave the party, and Matt tells Barry about how he told Tori the truth about his job. Barry patronizes him for not trying to have just one night of enjoyment and attempts to lighten the mood by offering Matt a line of cocaine, despite him driving. Matt, feeling vulnerable, attempts to snort the cocaine, but ends up driving the convertible off the road and into a ditch. A police cruiser soon arrives, and it turns out to be Matts dad and his police partner. Already disappointed with Matts unwillingness to choose a career path, Mr. Franklin damages the convertible even more as a means of coercing Matt to get a better job in order to pay off the damages. He takes Matt and Barry into custody, but lets them off in the neighborhood with a warning. Matt apologizes to his dad for being such a failure, to which his dad replies that because hes never even tried to succeed, hes actually less than a failure. Then, in a less condescending tone, he encourages Matt to take a shot at anything in life.Knowing Tori has left her car at the party, Matt and Barry make their way back there, where bets are being placed on who will ""ride the ball"", a giant, steel sphere that someone enters and rides as its rolled down a hill (something Matts dad has stated that nobody has done since he himself was a kid). Matt finds Tori at the party and tries to apologize, but Tori is unwilling to forgive him. Feeling he has nothing to lose, Matt volunteers to ""ride the ball"". When he does the ball rolls downhill uncontrollably, hitting several parked cars and eventually flying off an embankment before landing in a backyard swimming pool. Matt almost drowns as the ball sinks, but manages to escape just in time. Barry rushes to the scene and walks with Matt back toward the party, meeting up with Wendy and Tori, who are elated to discover he wasnt killed. Matt apologizes to Tori, and she forgives him after playing a little hard-to-get and then gives him her phone number. All four return to the party, which is beginning to wind down as dawn approaches. All who are still there whoop it up at Matts successful return.Wendy, after realizing Matt was right all along, ends the engagement and breaks up with Kyle, who experiences a crying breakdown. Pondering his future with a Goth-type girl he met at the party, Barry is told by her that maybe he should go to college. Outside, as she leaves the party, Matt boldly kisses Tori goodbye. Matts dad is shown investigating the scene where the steel ball was found. He finds Matts Suncoast Video name tag floating in the pool, and smirks proudly.

535,536,Takers,2010,/wiki/Takers,"Detectives Jack Welles and Eddie Hatcher, investigate a daring heist by a group of well-organized bank robbers. The crew, led by Gordon Cozier, consists of John, A.J., and brothers Jake and Jesse Attica. The crew is without a former member, Ghost, who was caught during a previous robbery five years ago. In his absence, Jake began a relationship with his former girlfriend Lilly, who has accepted his marriage proposal.After Ghost is released from prison, he meets up with the crew to plan a heist, in which it is discovered that two trucks will travel together, but that all the money is kept in the lead truck, which holds $12 million.The crew, dressed as construction workers, hide out underground, while Ghost poses as a police officer, so he can keep an eye out for the trucks. Meanwhile, in order to cover themselves in case Ghost is setting them up, John heads to the top of a nearby garage to take out Ghost with a sniper rifle in case things go wrong. The blast, having been perfectly timed to the time the trucks had turned the last corner, occurs too far forward, because the lead driver had stopped short to avoid a bicyclist, and the ruse is up. The lead driver radios the police, while armed guards pile out of the rear truck.A gunfight ensues between the robbers in the crater and the guards on the street, until John, commandeers the rear truck, and rams the lead truck into the crater. John and the other robbers pack the cash into bags, and flee by heading down a variety of different tunnels, with the plan of connecting into various subway lines to make their escape.Welles and Hatcher show up on the scene, and, after learning of the robbers escape through the sewer system, remembers a map of the city subway system from the Russian gang hideout, and deduces that they must be escaping through the stations marked on the map where the sewers intersect the subway. They rush to the nearest station, where they find Jesse, and a chase ensues, during which Jesse hides his bag of money and is cornered, and is forced to shoot Detective Hatcher in his escape. Jesse escapes, while Welles stops to aid his partner, who dies from his wound.Jesse reconvenes with the rest of the crew at a hotel room, and admits to the shooting of Hatcher. It is now revealed that Ghost had previously cut a deal with the Russian gangsters to kill his former henchmen in exchange for half of the heists take. Ghost gives the Russians the hotel room number, then escapes out the bathroom window, just before the Russians storm the room and attempt to kill the crew. A.J. dies in the ensuing firefight, but the rest of the crew is able to kill the Russians, and flee the building before the police arrive. Jake and Jesse return home where, to their horror, Jake finds Lillys corpse, and Jesse finds the safe where they kept their secret stash of money opened and cleaned out. The police surround their home, and shoot the two when they make a suicide charge outside, killing them.Gordon and John separate to make their escape, but realize that Ghost intends to take all of their money, which is being held by Scott, a well-connected fence. Ghost sneaks onto Scotts private plane and kills him, taking their laundered money in two suitcases. Gordon and Detective Welles arrive, and a three-way Mexican standoff results in which Ghost hits both Gordon and Welles. As Ghost prepares to finish Gordon off, John arrives and shoots him dead. John recognizes Welles as the same cop, who was with the little girl. John and Gordon refuse to kill Welles. John and an injured Gordon take the money and drive off, with Gordons sister Naomi in tow.

536,537,Tangled,2010,/wiki/Tangled,"Long ago, a drop of sunlight became a flower capable of healing illness, decay, and injury. For hundreds of years, the flower is used by Mother Gothel to retain her youth, until soldiers from a nearby kingdom, Corona, take the flower to heal their ailing queen. Shortly afterwards, the Queen gives birth to Princess Rapunzel. While attempting to recover the flower, Gothel discovers Rapunzels golden hair contains the flowers healing properties, and that cutting her hair destroys its power. Gothel abducts the baby and raises her as her own daughter in an isolated tower. Once a year, the King and Queen release sky lanterns on Rapunzels birthday, hoping for their daughter to see them and return.On the eve of her 18th birthday, Rapunzel, who sees the lanterns each year on her birthday, requests to leave the tower and discover their source, but Gothel refuses, claiming that the outside world is a dangerous place. Meanwhile, a thief named Flynn Rider steals Rapunzels crown from the palace and inadvertently discovers the tower after ditching his allies, the Stabbington brothers, while fleeing from the palace guards. Rapunzel knocks Flynn out with a frying pan and hides the crown, unaware of its significance. She convinces a reluctant Flynn to escort her to see the lanterns in exchange for the return of the crown, as a way to prove to Gothel that she can take care of herself in the ""dangerous"" outside world.Eager to reclaim the crown, Flynn takes Rapunzel to the Snuggly Duckling, a pub filled with menacing thugs, in an effort to discourage her into returning home, but the thugs are charmed by Rapunzel instead. Royal soldiers led by one of the royal armys horses, Maximus, arrive in search of Flynn. Rapunzel and Flynn escape but are then trapped in a flooding cave. Resigned to his fate, Flynn reveals his real name: Eugene Fitzherbert. Rapunzel remembers that her hair glows when she sings, and uses it to provide enough light to find a way out of the cave. Eugene and Rapunzel take refuge in a forest where Gothel, now in league with the Stabbingtons, gives the crown to Rapunzel and suggests using it to test Eugenes faithfulness.Maximus finds the pair and tries to arrest Flynn, but Rapunzel arranges a truce in honor of her birthday. The group reaches the kingdom and enjoys the festivities, culminating in an evening cruise as the lanterns are released. There, Rapunzel gives Eugene the crown and after fulfilling her dream of seeing the lanterns in person. Rapunzel and Eugene realize they have fallen in love with each other and are about to kiss when Eugene notices the Stabbingtons on the shore. Eugene leaves Rapunzel to give them the crown, but they tie him to a boat and confront Rapunzel, convincing her that Eugene has left her. Gothel then stages a rescue, betraying and incapacitating the brothers, and leaves with Rapunzel as Eugene and the Stabbingtons are detained at the palace.Back at the tower, Rapunzel recognizes the symbol of the kingdom, which she had subconsciously incorporated into her paintings over the years. Realizing that she is the long-lost princess, she confronts Gothel. As Eugene is sentenced to hang, the Duckling regulars help him escape. He is then carried back to Gothels tower on Maximus. Eugene enters by climbing Rapunzels hair, only to find Rapunzel bound and gagged. Gothel stabs Eugene and tries to force Rapunzel to leave with her, but Rapunzel agrees to submit forever willingly if she is allowed to heal Eugene. Eugene, dying, instead slices off Rapunzels hair, destroying its magic and causing Gothels age to suddenly catch up with her. She then trips and falls out of the window of the tower, turning into dust in the process.A heartbroken Rapunzel mourns for Eugene. However, her tear, which still contains some of the suns power, lands on his cheek and restores his life. The two return to the kingdom and Rapunzel reunites with her parents. Overjoyed, the kingdom breaks out in celebration, and Eugene is pardoned for his crimes.

John and Lori are invited to a party put on by Loris womanizing manager Rex, but Ted lures John away to a party at his apartment with the offer to meet Sam J. Jones, the star of their favorite film, Flash Gordon. John intends to stay only a few minutes but gets caught up in the occasion. Lori finds John there and breaks up with him. John blames Ted for ruining his life and banishes him.John and Ted confront each other about their ruined friendship and they fight but manage to reconcile after a violent brawl in their hotel room.

At a dock at night, she sees the Foot raiding cargo containers. After an unseen vigilante attacks the thieves, April notices a symbol left behind. Aprils supervisor Bernadette Thompson and her coworkers are oblivious to her story. Later while covering a charity event thrown by Sacks Industries, April expresses gratitude to the companys CEO Eric Sacks, who was her late fathers lab partner.Frustrated by the vigilante, the Foot Clans leader Shredder has the Foot Soldiers take hostages at a subway station in order to draw him out. April, at the scene, becomes a hostage herself. Four mysterious figures arrive, take out the Clan, and free the hostages. April follows them to a rooftop and is shocked to see that the vigilantes are anthropomorphic mutant turtles, causing her to pass out. When she regains consciousness, they advise her not to tell anyone of them. As they leave, April hears Raphael and Leonardos names.April returns to her apartment and remembers ""Project Renaissance"", her fathers science experiment, which involved four turtles named Leonardo, Donatello, Michelangelo, Raphael, and a mutated rat called Splinter. Unable to convince Bernadette of the Turtles existence, April is dismissed. Her coworker Vern Fenwick drives her to Sacks estate where she confides in him about her discovery. Sacks believes her and reveals that he and Aprils father had been experimenting on a mutagen created to cure disease, which was thought lost in the fire that killed her dad.At Splinters behest, the Turtles bring April to their sewer lair. Splinter explains April had saved them all from the fire and freed them into the sewers. The mutagen caused the five of them to grow and develop humanoid attributes. Splinter took on the role of their father, using Aprils father as an example. After finding a book on Ninjutsu in a storm drain, he proceeded to teach himself, then the Turtles, in the fighting style. When April reveals she told Sacks about her discovery of the Turtles, Splinter informs her that Sacks turned on her father and killed him.Then, Shredder and the Foot Soldiers attack the lair, defeating Splinter and incapacitating Raphael while the other Turtles are captured. April comes out of hiding and she and Raphael plan to save the others. At Sacks estate, he has the Turtles blood drained in order to create an antidote to a deadly virus that Sacks hopes to flood New York with, believing he will become rich from people seeking his cure. Raphael, April, and Vern storm the estate and free the other Turtles. The group then escapes the compound in pursuit of Sacks.On a radio tower in the city, Sacks and Shredder plant a device that will flood the city with the virus while Sacks is preparing to convert the mutagen to healing factor. April and Vern subdue Sacks in the lab, while the Turtles are battling Shredder on the roof. During the fight, the towers support beams collapse. As the turtles try to keep it from falling and infecting the city, April confronts Shredder with the mutagen. In the struggle, the tower collapses and the Turtles pull April onto it with them, while Shredder falls to the street and is captured by the police. Believing they are about to die, the Turtles confess their secrets, while Raphael gives an impassioned speech of his love for his brothers before they land harmlessly on the street. They vanish before the humans find them and return to the sewers, where they give Splinter the mutagen and he begins to recover.Sometime later, April meets with Vern, who tries and fails to ask her on a date.

Before the Resistance can triumph, Skynet activates a time machine and sends a T-800 (Model 101) Terminator back to May 12, 1984, to kill Johns mother Sarah. Johns right-hand man, Kyle Reese, volunteers to travel back in time to protect her. As Kyle floats in the machines magnetic field, he sees John being attacked by another Resistance soldier and has visions from his childhood about Sarah Connor.When it arrives in Los Angeles 1984, Skynets T-800 is disabled by Sarah and ""Pops"", a reprogrammed T-800 sent to protect Sarah when she was nine years old. Kyle arrives shortly afterwards, and is intercepted by a T-1000. Sarah and Pops join Kyle and destroy the T-1000 with acid; she and Pops reveal that they have constructed a makeshift time machine similar to Skynets, and Sarah plans to travel to 1997 (the year Skynet becomes self-aware). Realizing that the timeline has been altered, Kyle is convinced that the future has changed because of the warning he received in his childhood vision and persuades Sarah to travel to 2017 to stop Skynet.In 2017, Kyle and Sarah materialize in the middle of a busy San Francisco highway and are apprehended by city police. While they are treated for injuries, Sarah and Kyle learn that Skynet is called ""Genisys"" (a soon-to-be-unveiled global operating system which is embraced by the public). John suddenly appears and rescues Sarah and Kyle; Pops arrives and unexpectedly shoots John, revealing that John is an advanced T-3000 Terminator. While Kyle was traveling back in time a T-5000, the physical embodiment of Skynet disguised as a member of the Resistance, attacked John and transformed him into a nanocyte infiltrator. John, tasked with ensuring Cyberdyne Systems survival, traveled back in time to assist them with the development of Genisys and hence securing Skynet and its machines rise.A day before Skynets worldwide attack, Sarah, Kyle and Pops escape to a safe house and make final preparations to destroy Cyberdynes Genisys mainframe. They head toward Cyberdynes headquarters with the T-3000 in close pursuit. During an airborne chase, Pops dive-bombs into the T-3000s helicopter and causes it to crash. The T-3000 survives the crash and enters the Cyberdyne complex, where it advances the countdown from 13 hours to 15 minutes. Kyle, Sarah and Pops plant bombs at key points in the facility while holding off the T-3000.In a final battle, Pops traps the T-3000 in the magnetic field of a prototypical time machine. Both are destroyed, but just before the explosion the remains of Pops are flung out of the apparatus into a nearby experimental vat of mimetic polyalloy. Kyle and Sarah reach a bunker beneath the facility and the explosion sets off the bombs, preventing Genisys from coming online. Pops appears, upgraded with mimetic polyalloy components similar to that of the T-1000, and helps them escape from the debris.The trio travels to Kyles childhood home, where Kyle tells his younger self about Genisys and instructs him to repeat the warning to himself, securing the trios arrival from 1984. Sarah and Kyle finally kiss and they along with Pops drive off into the countryside.

Working on this intelligence, the Resistance plans to launch an offensive against Skynets headquarters in San Francisco. It is decided among the Resistance that the offensive will commence in four days, due to an intercepted kill-list created by Skynet, which plans to terminate the Resistances command staff within the same time frame. John learns he is second on this list, following Kyle Reese (Yelchin). The Resistance leaders are unaware of Kyles importance, but John knows that Kyle will eventually travel back in time and become his father (as seen in The Terminator), and realizes that Skynet has learned of this fact.Arriving at the ruins of Los Angeles, Marcus encounters Kyle and a mute child named Star (Berry) during a skirmish with Skynets machines where Kyle and Star are subsequently abducted and taken prisoner by Skynet. Two Resistance A-10 airplanes are shot down while trying to intercept a machine transport. Wright locates downed pilot Blair Williams (Bloodgood). They then make their way to Johns base, where thereafter, Marcus is wounded by a magnetic land mine. Attempting to save his life, the Resistance fighters discover that Marcus is actually a cyborg, with a mechanical endoskeleton and a partially artificial cerebral cortex. Although Marcus believes himself to be human, John and his wife Kate (Howard) think that Marcus has been sent to execute him and orders him to be killed. Blair helps Marcus escape. During the pursuit, Marcus saves Johns life from Skynets hydrobots and the two make a bargain: Marcus will enter Skynets headquarters in San Francisco, to help John rescue Kyle and the other prisoners, if he lets him live.John pleads with General Ashdown to delay the offensive so he can formulate a plan to extract the human captives, but Ashdown refuses and relieves John of his command. However, the Resistance disobeys Ashdowns orders and instead, await Johns signal. Marcus enters the base, interfaces with the computer, and disables perimeter defenses so that Connor can infiltrate the cellblock and release human prisoners. Wright learns from Skynet (which assumes the form of Dr. Kogan on a screen), that he was resurrected and built into a machine to lure John to the base; when the Resistance launches its attack, John will be killed, achieving the goal that Skynet had failed to accomplish in the past. The hidden signal that the Resistance received earlier is revealed to be a ruse, and Skynet uses it to track down and destroy the command submarine with the Resistance leaders aboard.Marcus tears out the hardware linking him to Skynet and assists John in battling the new T-800 (Model 101) Terminator (Kickinger). Marcus is soon outclassed in strength and temporarily disabled until John comes to his aid. Marcus eventually defeats the T-800, while John destroys the base by rigging together explosives. John, Marcus, Kyle and Star are airlifted out. John though was seriously wounded during the assault with a life-threatening injury to his heart. Marcus offers his own heart for transplantation, sacrificing himself to save John. As he recovers, John radios to other Resistance fighters that, although this battle has been won, the war still continues.",200000000,"[{""id"": 28, ""name"": ""Action""}, {""id"": 878, ""name"": ""Science Fiction""}, {""id"": 53, ""name"": ""Thriller""}]",https://www.warnerbros.com/terminator-salvation,534,"[{""id"": 83, ""name"": ""saving the world""}, {""id"": 310, ""name"": ""artificial intelligence""}, {""id"": 530, ""name"": ""prophecy""}, {""id"": 582, ""name"": ""san francisco""}, {""id"": 679, ""name"": ""cyborg""}, {""id"": 1373, ""name"": ""killer robot""}, {""id"": 1420, ""name"": ""gas station""}, {""id"": 4458, ""name"": ""post-apocalyptic""}, {""id"": 4565, ""name"": ""dystopia""}, {""id"": 6092, ""name"": ""army""}, {""id"": 6112, ""name"": ""firearm""}, {""id"": 11159, ""name"": ""wartime""}, {""id"": 12670, ""name"": ""los angeles""}]",en,"All grown up in post-apocalyptic 2018, John Connor must lead the resistance of humans against the increasingly dominating militaristic robots.

541,542,The 5th Wave,2016,/wiki/The_5th_Wave_(film),"Ohio high-schooler Cassie Sullivan, armed with an M4 carbine, emerges from the woods to raid an abandoned gas station. Upon entering, she hears a male voice calling for help. She finds a wounded man, who points a gun at her, but they each put their weapons down. His other hand is under his jacket and as he takes it out, she sees a glint of metal and kills him. He was holding a Christian cross and the screen cuts to black to show her backstory.A city-sized alien spaceship is circling Earth, containing extraterrestrials referred to as ""The Others"". Ten days later, The Others unleash their 1st Wave, an electromagnetic pulse that permanently destroys all electrical power. The 2nd Wave has The Others manipulate the planets geology and fault lines, causing earthquakes and megatsunamis that destroy coastal cities and islands. For the 3rd Wave, The Others weaponize a strain of avian flu virus, with birds carrying the infectant across the planet. Cassies mother is one of the casualties.Cassie, her father and her younger brother Sam, find a summer camp in use as a refuge in the woods with roughly 300 survivors. A few days later, an Army unit with working vehicles rolls into the camp. The units commander, Colonel Vosch, claims there is an imminent threat of a 4th Wave and they will take the children to safety at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, intending to bring the buses back to retrieve the adults. Cassie is separated from Sam, and witnesses the Army massacring all the adults, her father included.Cassie scavenges her way toward the base, but is shot in the leg by an unseen shooter and passes out. About a week later, she wakes up in the farmhouse of a young man named Evan Walker, who saved her. Cassie leaves towards the base with Evan, but learns that he is an Other, sent years ago as a sleeper agent and merged his consciousness into a human host. The sleepers roam their designated zones, killing human survivors. Evan admits his humanity was reactivated when he saw her, disagrees with the invasion and lets her leave. He warns that Colonel Vosch and the military are possessed by the consciousness of individual Others.At the base, the military have used deception and technology to convince the rescued children that the humans outside the base have been possessed. They provide military training to the children, forming them into squads to go on kill missions outside the base. Sam has been placed into a squad led by Ben, a boy Cassie had a crush on, along with Ringer, a tough teenage girl, Dumbo and Teacup. While out on a kill mission, Ringer removes her military implant, causing her to register as an Other-possessed human on the squads scopes. The squad deduces the plan to have them kill real unpossessed humans, making them the 5th Wave. Ben sends his squad into the woods and returns to base, claiming his squad was killed, for the purpose of retrieving Sam, who was left behind.Ben confronts Colonel Vosch about child warriors being the 5th Wave and Cassie kills Sergeant Reznik during her one-on-one indoctrination spiel. Ben and Cassie find each other and leave to find Sam. Evan sets off numerous bombs and advises them to quickly find Sam before the destruction of the entire facility. Colonel Vosch and the surviving military evacuate with the human children by military aircraft. Cassie, Ben and Sam escape, with help from Ringer, just as Evan completes the destruction of the base.

542,543,The Adjustment Bureau,2011,/wiki/The_Adjustment_Bureau,"In 2006, Brooklyn Congressman David Norris unsuccessfully runs for the United States Senate. While rehearsing his concession speech, David meets Elise Sellas. They share a passionate kiss, though he does not get her name. Inspired by her, David delivers an unusually candid speech that is well-received, making him a favorite for the 2010 race.A month later, David prepares for a new job. At Madison Square Park, near Davids home, a man named Harry Mitchell receives an assignment from his superior Richardson. Harry is to spill coffee on Davids shirt by 7:05 AM so that David will miss his bus. However, Mitchell falls asleep; David boards the bus, meets Elise and gets her phone number.David arrives at work early and finds everyone in the building frozen and being examined by unfamiliar men. David attempts to escape, but is incapacitated and taken to a warehouse. Richardson reluctantly reveals to David the existence of the ""Adjustment Bureau"". As its employees, Richardson and his men ensure peoples lives proceed following ""the Plan"", a complex document Richardson attributes to ""the Chairman"". The Bureau confiscates and destroys the note that contains Elises phone number, and David is warned that if he reveals the existence of the Bureau to anyone else, he will be ""reset""—akin to being lobotomized. He is not meant to meet Elise again.Three years later, David again encounters Elise after seeing her from a bus window; he tells her he has spent three years riding that bus to work, hoping to see her. He learns that she dances for Cedar Lake Contemporary Ballet. The Bureau tries to stop them from starting a relationship by altering their schedules and preventing them from meeting. David races across town, fighting the Bureaus abilities to ""control his choices"" to ensure he will meet Elise. During the chase the Bureau uses ordinary doorways to travel instantly to distant locations.Senior official Thompson takes over Davids adjustment and takes him to the warehouse, where David argues he has the right to choose his own path. Thompson says humanity received free will after the height of the Roman Empire, but then brought the Dark Ages upon itself. The Bureau took control after five centuries of barbarism, and created the Renaissance, the Enlightenment, and the scientific revolution. When free will was granted in 1910, it resulted in World War I, the Great Depression, Fascism, the Holocaust, and the Cuban Missile Crisis, forcing the Bureau to retake control. Thompson strongly implies that without Elises influence David will become President of the United States, while Elise will become a world-famous dancer and choreographer, and that being together will ruin both of their futures. Thompson causes Elise to sprain her ankle at a performance to demonstrate his power, and David abandons her at the hospital to save them from the fate Thompson described.Eleven months later, Charlie tells David of Elises imminent wedding as he campaigns again. Harry contacts David via secret meetings in the rain or near water, which prevents the Bureau from tracking them. Harry reveals that Thompson exaggerated the negative consequences of David and Elises relationship, and teaches David how to use doors to teleport and evade the Bureaus adjustments. Just before the wedding David reaches Elise, reveals the Bureaus existence to her, and shows her how he travels through doors. The Bureau pursues them across New York City. When they emerge at the Statue of Liberty David decides to find the Chairman to end the chase, and Elise chooses to accompany him. They enter the Bureaus offices with agents in pursuit.After a chase in the building David and Elise find themselves surrounded on the observation deck of the GE Building. They declare their love and kiss before David can be reset. When they let go of each other, the Bureau members have gone. Thompson appears, but is interrupted by Harry, who shows him, and then David and Elise, their revised Plan from the Chairman: one that is blank starting from the current moment. Harry commends them for their devotion to each other, then says they are free to leave. David and Elise walk down the street as Harry speculates that the Chairmans goal may be to prepare humanity to ""one day"" write its own Plan",50200000,"[{""id"": 878, ""name"": ""Science Fiction""}, {""id"": 53, ""name"": ""Thriller""}, {""id"": 10749, ""name"": ""Romance""}]",http://www.theadjustmentbureau.com/,38050,"[{""id"": 612, ""name"": ""hotel""}, {""id"": 733, ""name"": ""dancer""}, {""id"": 2656, ""name"": ""hat""}, {""id"": 2944, ""name"": ""senator""}, {""id"": 2964, ""name"": ""future""}, {""id"": 4427, ""name"": ""honesty""}, {""id"": 4812, ""name"": ""plan""}, {""id"": 5091, ""name"": ""kiss""}, {""id"": 6001, ""name"": ""speech""}, {""id"": 6038, ""name"": ""marriage""}, {""id"": 6083, ""name"": ""politician""}, {""id"": 6511, ""name"": ""alone""}, {""id"": 10855, ""name"": ""fate""}, {""id"": 14967, ""name"": ""foot chase""}, {""id"": 18073, ""name"": ""covert agency""}, {""id"": 18074, ""name"": ""courthouse""}, {""id"": 18075, ""name"": ""political campaign""}, {""id"": 156866, ""name"": ""based on short story""}]",en,"A man glimpses the future Fate has planned for him – and chooses to fight for his own destiny.

543,544,The Age of Adaline,2015,/wiki/The_Age_of_Adaline,"One afternoon in San Francisco, Adaline Bowman purchases fake IDs at an apartment before returning home to feed her dog. She then goes to work and opens a box of film reels, which highlight historical events and times. A voiceover ties together the film reels explaining the story of Adalines life so far. She was born on New Years Day 1908, then later married and gave birth to a daughter, only to become a widow after her husband died in a tragic accident. Years later, in 1937, Adaline crashed her car when she swerved into a ravine during a snowstorm and died in the freezing lake nearby, but a lightning strike suddenly revived her. From that moment on, Adaline has stayed physically 29 years old.One night, two suspicious FBI agents attempt to force her onto an airplane for study, but she escapes captivity and realizes that she will have to spend the rest of her life on the run. Ever since, she has changed her identification and address according to the era, while her daughter Flemming ages normally, to the point where she appears older than Adaline.On New Years Eve in the present year, she attends a party where she meets Ellis Jones, introducing herself as her current alias, Jennifer. He asks to see her again but she refuses, knowing she can never fall in love because she can never have a normal future with someone. The next day at work, Ellis arrives and again asks Adaline to go on a date with him. Finally she accepts.In a flashback, Adaline is shown pulling up in a cab to a park where a man is waiting, holding an engagement ring. Scared, she asks the cab driver to keep going. Back in the present day, Adalines dog falls ill and she begins to ignore Ellis calls. He shows up at her apartment but she pushes him away, only to have a change of heart while looking through some old photographs and realizing she doesnt want to live the same year a hundred times without having a natural life.They later resolve their argument and Ellis asks Adaline to attend the party at his parents house celebrating his parents fortieth anniversary, and she says yes. Upon their arrival, Ellis introduces her to his father, William, who recognizes her instantly and calls her Adaline. She appears to recognize him, too, but lies, telling him that Adaline was her mother, who has since died. A flashback shows how they met and came to be in love, soon revealing that he was the man with the engagement ring she stood up that afternoon. One night, Ellis tells Adaline he is falling in love with her and she is unsure of how to react.The following day, Adaline talks with William outside and he notices a scar on her left hand, and becomes shaken. Another flashback reveals that Adaline cut her hand while they were hiking decades ago and he had stitched it up himself. He realizes that she is truly Adaline and confronts her. She becomes upset, claiming she used to be ""normal"" and doesnt know what changed her. He begs her not to run, for Ellis sake, but she says she doesnt know how to stay. She flees and returns to the house, writing a note to Ellis while he showers, then she packs her things and leaves. Moments later, Ellis finds the letter and confronts his father, who refuses to explain.While driving home, Adaline thinks of all the times she has run and suddenly has a change of heart about the way she lives her life. She stops and calls her daughter to tell her she is going to stop running. As she turns the car around, a tow truck plows into her in a hit-and-run accident, leaving her to die. Freezing and helpless, Adaline dies again. An ambulance arrives and she is revived by the electricity of the defibrillator. Later in the hospital, she wakes up to Ellis, and the two profess their love for one another. Adaline then tells him of her 107 years of life.One year later, Ellis and Adaline are going to a New Years Eve party. As she is leaving, she notices something strange in the hallway mirror: her first grey hair, proving she has begun to age naturally again. When Ellis asks if she is okay, she responds: ""Yes...

Peters parents gather hidden documents, take Peter to the home of his Aunt May and Uncle Ben, and then mysteriously depart.Years later, a teenage Peter attends Midtown Science High School, where he is bullied by Flash Thompson, and has caught the eye of Gwen Stacy. At home, Peter finds his fathers papers, and learns his father worked with fellow scientist Dr. Curt Connors at Oscorp in the field of cross-species genetics. Sneaking into Oscorp, Peter enters a lab where a ""biocable"" is under development from genetically modified spiders, one of which bites him. He later discovers he has developed spider-like abilities, such as sharp senses, reflexes and speed.After studying Richards papers, Peter visits the one-armed Connors, reveals he is Richards son and gives Connors his fathers ""decay rate algorithm"", the missing piece in Connors experiments on regenerating limbs. Connors is being pressed by his superior, Dr. Ratha, to devise a cure for the dying head of Oscorp, Norman Osborn. In school, Peter is exposed after a basketball challenge with Flash, in which Peter accidentally shatters the backboard glass. His uncle changes work shifts to meet with the principal, and asks Peter to walk May home for him that night. Peter forgets to do so, distracted while at Oscorp helping Connors regenerate the limb of a laboratory mouse. At home, he and Ben argue, and Peter leaves. At a nearby deli, a cashier refuses to let Peter buy milk when Peter is two cents short; when a thief suddenly raids the store, Peter allows him to escape. While searching for Peter, Ben attempts to stop the thief, and is killed. The thief escapes as Peter finds Ben dead on the sidewalk.Afterward, Peter uses his new abilities to track down criminals matching the killers description. After a fall lands him inside an abandoned gym, a luchador-wrestling poster inspires him to create a mask to hide his identity. He adds a spandex suit and builds mechanical devices to attach to his wrists to shoot a biocable ""web"". Later, at dinner with Gwens family, he has a tense conversation with her father, police captain George Stacy, over the new masked vigilantes motives. After dinner, Peter reveals his identity to Gwen, and they kiss.After seeing success with the mouse using lizard DNA, Ratha demands Connors begin human trials immediately. Connors refuses to rush the drug-testing procedure and put innocent people at risk. Ratha fires Connors and decides to test Connors serum at a Veterans Administration hospital under the guise of a flu shot. In an act of desperation, Connors tries the formula on himself. After passing out, he awakens to find his missing arm has regenerated. Discovering that Ratha is on his way to the VA hospital, Connors, whose skin is turning green and scaly, goes to intercept him.

He pursues and apprehends Aleksei Sytsevich and saves Max Dillions life before a taxi could have hit him. Later, Peter meets with his girlfriend Gwen Stacy at their high school graduation ceremony and, insisting he keep his vow to her late father, ends their relationship. Peters childhood friend, Harry Osborn, returns to Manhattan to see his terminally-ill father, Norman, CEO of OsCorp. Norman explains his illness is genetic, and Harry is at the age where it first develops. Norman gives Harry a small device he claims contains his lifes work. The next day, Norman dies, and Harry is appointed the new OsCorp CEO.While working in an OsCorp laboratory, Max shocks himself by accident and falls into a tank of genetically-engineered electric eels. They attack him, and he mutates into a living electric generator. Meanwhile, Peter attempts to maintain a friendship with Gwen, but she reveals that she may move to England for schooling. Before they can discuss it, Dillon wanders into Times Square, accidentally causing a blackout, and is stopped by Spider-Man after a battle. Dillon is taken to the Ravencroft Institute, where he is studied by German scientist Dr. Kafka. Meanwhile, the first symptoms of Harrys illness are showing, and he uses the device Norman gave him to deduce that Spider-Mans blood could help save him. He asks Peter, who has been selling photos of Spider-Man to the Daily Bugle, to aid him in finding Spider-Man. Peter refuses, unsure of what effects the transfusion would have. Although he later comes to Harry as Spider-Man, he still refuses, and Harry becomes resentful towards Spider-Man. OsCorp vice-president Donald Menken frames Harry for covering up Dillons accident, removes him as CEO and takes control of Oscorp. Harrys assistant, Felicia Hardy, informs him of equipment that could help him, so he makes a deal with Dillon, who now calls himself ""Electro,"" to get him back inside the OsCorp building. There he finds a suit of armor and other equipment made by Norman, as well as venom from the now-destroyed genetically-altered spiders. The venom accelerates Harrys illness, and transforms him into a goblin-like creature, but the suits built-in emergency protocol restores his health and cures his disease.Peter uses information left by his father to locate the video message in an abandoned subway stations hidden lab. Richard explains that he had to leave because he refused to cooperate with Normans plans to make biogenetic weapons. Peter then hears a voicemail from Gwen, telling him that she was offered the British scholarship for studying medicine at Somerville College, University of Oxford, and is heading to the airport earlier than expected.

555,556,The BFG,2016,/wiki/The_BFG_(2016_film),"In July 1983, Sophie, a 10-year-old girl who lives in a London orphanage, stays awake reading through the nights due to her insomnia. At 3 in the morning, or what she calls the ""witching hour"", she sees an elderly giant outside her window. The giant captures her and takes her into Giant Country. There, he explains that Sophie must stay with him for the rest of her life because she saw him and must not be allowed to reveal the existence of giants. He also explains that she will put herself at risk if she goes out in the open, as nine other giants inhabit Giant Country, all of whom are man-eaters and favor the taste of children.When Sophie awakes, the Fleshlumpeater, the infantile leader of the man-eating giants (and the same one from Sophies nightmare), enters the smaller giants home and smells Sophie. The Fleshlumpeater nearly devours Sophie before exiting. The giant gives Sophie some replacement clothes, as hers are ruined, and Sophie convinces him to take her to Dream Country to catch dreams together. As they leave, they accidentally wake up the Bloodbottler, the more intelligent and cunning second-in-command to the Fleshlumpeater, who awakens the other man-eating giants. They torment and bully the friendly giant by throwing him around like a football and rolling him down a hill in a garbage truck. As the pair escape during a thunderstorm which drives the man-eating giants into the cave, the Fleshlumpeater and the Bloodbottler find Sophies blanket (which she had dropped before) and plan to find her. Climbing up the mountain, Sophie tells the giant that he shouldnt allow the other giants to bully him.The pair arrives in Dream Country and catch a dream each. While there, the giant reveals that his only other alias (other than ""Runt"" which the other giants call him, as they are much larger) is ""the Big Friendly Giant"" and Sophie decides to call him ""BFG"". The two then head to London to spread good dreams to sleeping children. As they do so, Sophie realizes that she has lost her blanket. The BFG realizes that the other man-eating giants know about her and she wakes up outside the orphanage. He explains that the last human child he took and raised was discovered and eaten by Fleshlumpeaters group. She throws herself out of her window in the hope he will appear again to catch her, and he does.When they return to the BFGs home, the other giants barge in and upend the place looking for Sophie, destroying much of the BFGs hard work. Sophie evades detection and the enraged BFG finally stands up to them and drives them off with a hot fire iron. While hidden, Sophie finds the home of the last human to live with the BFG before becoming a victim of Fleshlumpeaters group. She leaves his jacket on his bed and finds a portrait of Queen Victoria amongst his belongings. From this she devises a plan to forge a nightmare and give it to Elizabeth II, the Queen of the United Kingdom. The nightmare consists of giants eating the children of England, the British Army fighting the giants, and Sophie appearing on her windowsill.They head to Buckingham Palace where upon waking from her nightmare, the Queen and her maid Mary find Sophie on the windowsill as in the nightmare with the BFG outside in the palace grounds. Sophie and the BFG inform the Queen, Mary, and Mr. Tibbs that the child-eating beasts in her dream are indeed real and must be stopped at all costs before they cause any more harm to her subjects. After a large breakfast they all enjoy, the Queen soon dispatches soldiers to Giant Country.The BFG plans to give the man-eating giants the regretful nightmare Sophie caught the night before, so they will be more compliant once caught. As she smashes the jar, they are almost all immediately consumed by guilt, but the Fleshlumpeater awakens and intercepts the nightmare before it can affect him. Despite this, the British armys helicopters effortlessly ensnare and capture him and the other giants. They are lifted away onto an isolated uncharted island somewhere in the world where numerous snozzcumbers and a large crate of snozzcumber seeds are left with them, much to their fury.In the aftermath, Sophie begins living in the Queens palace with Mary while the BFG returns to Giant Country to resume giving dreams to people and begins growing a wide variety of vegetables inspired by his time in England. The film ends with Sophie narrating that whenever she feels lonely, which is less often than before, she talks to him. He can still hear her.

557,558,The Book Thief,2013,/wiki/The_Book_Thief_(film),"In February 1938, a voice representing Death tells about how the young Liesel Meminger has piqued his interest. In one of the opening scenes, Liesel is traveling with her mother and younger brother on a train. On the way, her brother dies and is buried next to the tracks. Liesel steals her first book, titled The Grave Diggers Handbook, when it falls out of the gravediggers pocket. Liesel is then brought to her new home in Munich, where she meets her new foster parents Rosa Hubermann and Hans Hubermann. Rudy Steiner, a boy who lives next door, accompanies her on her first day of school. When the teacher asks Liesel to write her name on the chalkboard, she is only able to write three Xs, revealing to her classmates that she is unable to write. She is taunted by her schoolmates who chant ""dummkopf"" (""dunce"") at her. One of the boys, Franz Deutscher, challenges her to read just one word to which Liesel responds by beating him up. She impresses Rudy, and they become fast friends. When Hans, her foster father, realizes that Liesel cannot read, he begins to teach her, using the book that she took from the graveside, and a giant chalkboard. Liesel becomes captivated with reading anything she can.Liesel and Rudy become members of the Hitler Youth movement. While at a Nazi book burning ceremony, Liesel and Rudy are harassed into throwing books onto the bonfire by Franz, but Liesel is upset to see the books being burned. When the bonfire ends and everyone leaves, Liesel is still there and she grabs a book that has been only singed. She is seen by Ilsa Hermann, wife of the burgermeister (mayor). When Rosa asks Liesel to take the laundry to the mayors spacious, gated house, she realizes that the woman who saw her taking the book is the mayors wife. Instead, Ilsa takes her into their library and tells Liesel she can come by anytime and read as much as shed like. One day Liesel is found reading by the mayor who not only puts a stop to her visits but dismisses Rosa as their laundress.During Kristallnacht, Max Vandenburg and his mother, who are Jewish, are told by a friend that only one of them can escape, and Maxs mother forces him to go. Maxs father had saved Hans life in World War I, and hence he goes to the Hubermanns house where Rosa and Hans give him shelter. Max initially stays in Liesels room while recovering from his trip, and they begin to become friends over their mutual hatred of Hitler. World War II begins, initially making most of the children in Liesels neighborhood very happy. Max is moved to the basement so that he can move around more, but it is cold and Max becomes dangerously ill. Liesel helps Max recover by reading to him books ""borrowed"" from the mayors library with every spare moment.One day while ""borrowing"" a book from the mayors home, Liesel is followed by Rudy. He discovers the secret of Max, whose name he reads on a journal Max gave to Liesel for Christmas. Rudy guesses that her family is hiding someone, and he swears to never tell anyone. Franz overhears Rudys last words of keeping it a secret and violently pushes Rudy to reveal the secret. Rudy throws the journal into the river to keep it away from Franz. After Franz leaves, Rudy plunges into the icy river to rescue the journal, and Liesel realizes that she can truly trust him. Soon, a local party member comes by to check the Hubermanns basement, and they have to hide Max.While working, Hans sees a neighbor and friend named Lehman being taken away by the police because he is a Jew. Hans tries to intervene, telling the officer that Lehman is a good man, but Hanss name is taken by the soldiers and he is thrown to the ground. Hans realizes what a mistake he has made, since this has made his family visible. He tells the family, and Max realises he must leave in order to protect them. Hans then receives a telegram that he has been conscripted into the army and must leave immediately.On the way home from school, Liesel believes she has seen Max in a line of Jews being forcibly marched through town, and she begins screaming his name, running through the line. She is thrown to the sidewalk twice by German soldiers and finally gives up when Rosa picks her up and takes her home.Hans returns home after being injured, and the family is reunited only for a short time. One night the city is bombed by accident, and the air raid sirens fail to go off. Hans, Rosa, and Rudys family are killed in the blast. Liesel was spared from the bombing because she fell asleep in the basement while writing in the journal given to her by Max. She sees her foster family on the ground, dead, she cries and hugs them.  Neighbors bring Rudy out of his house, barely alive. He begins to tell Liesel that he loves her, but he dies before he can finish the sentence. During this scene, Death is heard speaking again about how he received the souls of the dead. Liesel passes out, and one of the soldiers carries her to a stretcher. When she wakes up, she sees a book among the rubble and picks it up. She then sees the mayor and Ilsa drive up. With Ilsa being the only friend she has left, Liesel runs up to her and hugs her.Two years later, after Germany has fallen to the Allies, Liesel is working in the tailor shop owned by Rudys father. Max enters. Overjoyed by his survival and return, she runs to hug him. The final scene is Death speaking again about Liesels life and her death at the age of 90, mentioning her husband, children, and grandchildren, as we look over her modern day Manhattan Upper East Side apartment with pictures of her past and a portrait of her, upon which the camera lingers.

559,560,The Bourne Legacy,2012,/wiki/The_Bourne_Legacy_(film),"Six weeks after Jason Bournes escape from Moscow, Aaron Cross (Jeremy Renner), an operative belonging to a Defense Department black ops program called Operation Outcome, is assigned to Alaska for a training exercise. He is forced to survive weather extremes and traverse rugged terrain to arrive at a remote cabin as punishment for missing training and going off the grid for four days. The cabin is operated by an exiled Outcome operative, Number Three (Oscar Isaac), who informs Aaron that he has broken the mission record by two days. As an Outcome operative, Aaron uses experimental pills known as ""chems"" (chemicals) which enhance the physical and mental abilities of their users.After the Treadstone and Blackbriar programs are exposed, retired Air Force colonel Eric Byer (Edward Norton) is tasked with containing the fallout. He discovers a potentially scandalous video on the Internet showing a meeting between Treadstone and Outcome medical directors, Albert Hirsch (Albert Finney) and Dan Hillcott (Neil Brooks Cunningham). To prevent the Senate investigation from learning about Outcome, Byer orders everyone associated with the program killed. He sees the sacrifice as acceptable to protect next-generation ""beta programs"", including the supersoldier program LARX.Byer deploys a drone to eliminate Outcome agents Number Three and Five (Aaron) in Alaska. Aaron evades the drone and force-feeds his radio-frequency identification to a wolf which is then blown up by a missile, tricking Byer into believing Aaron is dead. Hirsch dies of an apparent heart attack before he can testify before the Senate. At Sterisyn-Morlanta, a biogenetics company supporting Outcome, researcher Dr. Donald Foite (Željko Ivanek) shoots and kills all but one of his colleagues in the research laboratory. After being cornered by guards, Foite turns his gun on himself, leaving biochemist Dr. Marta Shearing (Rachel Weisz) as the sole survivor.  Meanwhile, other Outcome agents are eliminated when their handlers give them poisoned yellow pills disguised as new chems.Four ""D-Track"" assassins disguised as federal agents visit Marta at her country house. After she states her belief of Foite having been chemically brainwashed into an emotionless killer, the assassins attempt to fake her suicide, but are killed by Aaron. He saves her life as she is his last link to the chems so that he can retain his enhanced capabilities and avoid withdrawal symptoms. Marta reveals that Cross has been genetically modified by a tailored virus to retain the physical benefits permanently without needing the green chems anymore. He still requires regular doses of blue chems to maintain his intelligence, but he is running out. Aaron confides to her that he is Private First Class Kenneth J. Kitsom (reportedly killed by a roadside bomb in the Iraq War) and that his recruiter added twelve points to his IQ, enabling Aaron to meet the United States Armys requirements. Without his enhanced intelligence, Aaron believes they stand no chance of survival. Aaron and Marta travel to Manila, where the chems are manufactured, to try to infect him with another virus so he will not need the blue chems and making his new intelligence permanent.Aaron and Marta bluff their way into the Morlanta Pacific pharmaceutical factory and Marta injects Aaron with the live virus stems. Byer alerts factory security, but Aaron and Marta evade capture. Byer orders LARX-03, a chemically-brainwashed supersoldier, to track and kill them. As Aaron is struck by flu-like symptoms induced by the virus, he hallucinates about his Outcome training. When police surround their shelter while Marta is buying medicine, she warns Aaron by screaming. Aaron rescues her and steals a motorbike. They are pursued by both the police and LARX-03. After a lengthy chase through the streets and marketplaces of Manila to Marikina, they lose the police, but not the assassin. As Aaron, still sick, begins losing consciousness, LARX-03 is killed when Marta causes his motorcycle to crash into a pillar. Marta persuades a Filipino boatman to help them escape by sea.Back in New York, Blackbriar supervisor Noah Vosen (David Strathairn) lies to the Senate, stating that Blackbriar was created solely to track down Jason Bourne, and that Deputy Director Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) committed treason by assisting Bourne and trying to sell Treadstone secrets to the press.",130000000,"[{""id"": 28, ""name"": ""Action""}, {""id"": 53, ""name"": ""Thriller""}]",http://www.thebournelegacy.com/,49040,"[{""id"": 782, ""name"": ""assassin""}, {""id"": 1994, ""name"": ""wolf""}, {""id"": 5729, ""name"": ""maryland""}, {""id"": 11767, ""name"": ""suicide by gunshot""}, {""id"": 15219, ""name"": ""rooftop""}, {""id"": 18067, ""name"": ""exploding house""}, {""id"": 18254, ""name"": ""laptop""}, {""id"": 181620, ""name"": ""tracking device""}, {""id"": 181623, ""name"": ""fake id""}, {""id"": 181628, ""name"": ""seoul south korea""}, {""id"": 181632, ""name"": ""pharmaceutical lab""}, {""id"": 181635, ""name"": ""government conspiracy""}, {""id"": 181637, ""name"": ""roof chase""}, {""id"": 181641, ""name"": ""manila philippines""}, {""id"": 181644, ""name"": ""hunted""}, {""id"": 181648, ""name"": ""false passport""}, {""id"": 181650, ""name"": ""alberta canada""}, {""id"": 181651, ""name"": ""lieutenant general""}]",en,"New CIA operative, Aaron Cross experiences life-or-death stakes that have been triggered by the previous actions of Jason Bourne.",90.33681,"[{""name"": ""Universal Pictures"", ""id"": 33}, {""name"": ""Dentsu"", ""id"": 6452}, {""name"": ""Relativity Media"", ""id"": 7295}, {""name"": ""Kennedy/Marshall Company, The"", ""id"": 7383}, {""name"": ""Captivate Entertainment"", ""id"": 25716}]","[{""iso_3166_1"": ""US"", ""name"": ""United States of America""}]",8/8/2012,276572938,120,"[{""iso_639_1"": ""en"", ""name"": ""English""}, {""iso_639_1"": ""ru"", ""name"": ""P\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439""}]",Released,There Was Never Just One,The Bourne Legacy,6,2651,0.5,0.110438555,0.5,0.5,0,-0.389561445,0.389561445,0.25970763,2.127484138
560,561,The Bourne Ultimatum,2012,/wiki/The_Bourne_Ultimatum_(film),"Following his pursuit by Kirill (in The Bourne Supremacy), Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) evades Moscow police while wounded and deals with more flashbacks of when he first joined Operation Treadstone. Six weeks later, CIA Deputy Director Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) divulges the audiotaped confession of Ward Abbott, the late former head of Treadstone, to Director Ezra Kramer (Scott Glenn). Meanwhile, in Turin, journalist Simon Ross (Paddy Considine) of The Guardian meets an informant to learn about Bourne and Operation Blackbriar, the program succeeding Treadstone. The CIA tracks Ross as he returns to London, after his mention of ""Blackbriar"" during a cell phone call to his editor is detected by the ECHELON system. Bourne reappears in Paris to inform Martin Kreutz (Daniel Brühl), the step-brother of his girlfriend Marie Helena Kreutz (Franka Potente), of her assassination in India, also in the previous film.Bourne reads Rosss articles and arranges a meeting with him at London Waterloo station. Bourne realizes that the CIA is following Ross and helps him evade capture for a while, but when he panics and ignores Bournes instructions, Ross is shot and killed by Blackbriar assassin Paz (Édgar Ramírez), in the middle of a busy station, on orders of Deputy Director Noah Vosen (David Strathairn). Vosens team, reluctantly assisted by Landy, analyzes Rosss notes and identifies his source as Neal Daniels (Colin Stinton), a CIA Station chief involved with Treadstone and Blackbriar. Bourne makes his way to Daniels office in Madrid but finds it empty. He incapacitates gunmen sent by Vosen and Landy. Nicky Parsons (Julia Stiles), a former Treadstone operative who shares a history with Bourne, tells him that Daniels has fled to Tangier and aids his escape from an arriving CIA unit.Nicky learns that Blackbriar ""asset"" Desh Bouksani (Joey Ansah) has been tasked with killing Daniels. Vosen sees that Nicky accessed information about Daniels and sends Bouksani after Nicky and Bourne as well, a decision with which Landy fiercely disagrees. Bourne follows Bouksani to Daniels but fails to prevent Danielss death by a planted bomb. However, Bourne manages to kill Bouksani before he can kill Nicky. After sending Nicky into hiding, Bourne examines the contents of Daniels briefcase and finds the address of the deep-cover CIA bureau in New York City, where Vosen directs Blackbriar. Bourne travels to New York.Landy receives a phone call from Bourne, which is intercepted by Vosen. When Landy tells him that his real name is David Webb and gives him the birth date ""4-15-71"", Bourne tells Landy to ""get some rest"" because she looks tired, tipping off that he is in New York and watching her from an overlooking building (a scene replicated from the end of the previous film). Vosen intercepts a text to Landy from Bourne of a location to meet up, and leaves his office with a tactical team. Bourne, however, waits for them all to leave, enters Vosens office, and takes classified Blackbriar documents. When he realizes that he has been tricked, Vosen sends Paz after Bourne, but the resulting car chase ends with Bourne forcing Pazs car to crash into a concrete barrier. Bourne holds the injured Paz at gunpoint, but spares his life.Bourne arrives at a hospital at 415 East 71st Street, having figured out Landys coded message. Outside, Bourne meets Landy and gives her the Blackbriar files before going inside. Vosen also figures out Landys code and warns Dr. Albert Hirsch (Albert Finney), who ran Treadstones behavior modification program, that Bourne is coming. He follows Landy inside the building but is too late to stop her from faxing the Blackbriar documents out. Meanwhile, Hirsch is confronted by Bourne on an upper floor, who now remembers that he volunteered for Treadstone. As Bourne flees to the roof, he is confronted by Paz, who asks, ""Why didnt you take the shot?""  Bourne asks Paz if he knows why hes supposed to kill him, and repeats the dying words of The Professor in The Bourne Identity: ""Look at us. Look at what they make you give."" Paz lowers his gun, but Vosen appears and shoots at Bourne as he jumps into the East River.Some time later, Nicky watches a news broadcast about the exposure of Operation Blackbriar, the arrests of Hirsch and Vosen, a criminal investigation against Kramer, and the whereabouts of David Webb, a.k.a. Jason Bourne. Upon hearing that his body has not been found after a three-day search of the river, Nicky smiles.

561,562,The Boy,2016,/wiki/The_Boy_(2016_film),"Greta Evans, a young American from Montana, is hired as a nanny by the Heelshires. Upon arriving in their small town in the United Kingdom, the elderly couple show Greta her charge: a porcelain doll named Brahms that they treat like their son. They then close the doors behind them so that they can ask Brahms if he wants Greta as babysitter. The old couple come out and say that Brahms agreed despite having ""rejected"" many previous babysitters. Over the next day, the couple coach Greta on taking care of Brahms and their house, leave her a list of rules to follow, then leave for a holiday. The rules include speaking louder than usual when reading a book to Brahms, and leaving food out on the table and not throwing it away. It also includes setting up rat traps.  Initially, Greta ignores the rules about the doll and follows her own routine. She regularly calls her sister Sandy, who tells her that her abusive ex-boyfriend Cole has been trying to find out where she is. Seemingly supernatural events occur like Brahms being in a different position which Greta disregards. Malcolm, the local grocery dealer, stops by to deliver groceries, and Greta learns that the real Brahms was killed in a fire 20 years ago on his eighth birthday. Greta accepts Malcolms offer to show her the town, and prepares for the date. However, her dress and jewelry vanish while she is in the shower, and she is lured to the attic by strange noises and locked in.She is mysteriously let out the next morning. She explains to Malcolm what happened, and they briefly discuss the real Brahms, whom Malcolm said Mr. Heelshire described as ""odd."" Strange things begin to happen—a childs sobs are heard in the hallways, phone calls are cut off, and the doll seems to move on its own, vanishing and reappearing elsewhere in the house. After receiving a phone call in which a childs voice urges her to follow the rules, Greta locks herself in her room. She later finds a peanut butter and jelly sandwich outside her door. Elsewhere, the Heelshires write a goodbye letter to Brahms, then drown themselves. They write a letter to Greta which she receives and ignores. Believing that Brahms spirit lives within the doll, Greta begins to take the rules more seriously. After Greta demonstrates the dolls ability to move by itself, Malcolm becomes worried. He informs Greta that the real Brahms was friends with a young girl about his age. One day, she was found in the forest with her skull crushed. Before the police could question Brahms, the Heelshires house was burned down with him in it. Malcolm warns Greta not to stay in the house, but Greta, having previously suffered a miscarriage after she was beaten by Cole, feels obligated to care for Brahms.One evening, Cole abruptly appears in the house and announces his intention to bring Greta back home, by force if necessary. Malcolm makes an early delivery and decides to stay nearby. As she puts Brahms to sleep, Greta asks Brahms for help. Cole wakes up and sees a message written in blood urging him to leave. Believing it was done by either Greta or Malcolm, Cole angrily snatches the doll from Greta and smashes it.The house begins to shake and the lights start flickering. Cole hears noises behind a mirror and investigates. The mirror explodes and knocks Cole to the ground. A strange voice calls Gretas name from the hole behind the mirror and a grown man wearing a porcelain mask identical to the dolls face emerges. It is revealed to be Brahms, who still speaks and thinks like an eight-year-old. Brahms apparently survived the fire and now has been living in the passages behind the walls of the house, the rules being in place so that Brahms could get food and hear through the walls. Brahms attacks and kills Cole, then turns on Malcolm and Greta.A chase ensues throughout the house. Greta and Malcolm discover Brahms room while trying to find an exit. A doll made from Gretas missing dress, hair and jewelry is in Brahms bed. Greta finds the final letter from the Heelshires revealing their plan of leaving Greta as a mate for Brahms. Brahms catches them and severely beats Malcolm, threatening to kill him if Greta leaves.Greta flees anyway, but then she returns with the intention of saving Malcolm. Arming herself with a screwdriver, Greta invokes the rules to force Brahms to go to bed. He asks for a good night kiss, and when he tries to kiss her, she stabs him with the screwdriver. Brahms throws Greta across the room and tries to choke her, but she pushes the screwdriver deeper into his organs and he collapses. Greta drags Malcolm to his car and sighs with relief as they leave the estate.Later, Brahms, who has survived, is seen repairing the shattered doll.",10000000,"[{""id"": 27, ""name"": ""Horror""}, {""id"": 9648, ""name"": ""Mystery""}, {""id"": 53, ""name"": ""Thriller""}]",http://theboymovie.tumblr.com/,321258,"[{""id"": 236, ""name"": ""suicide""}, {""id"": 392, ""name"": ""england""}, {""id"": 657, ""name"": ""fire""}, {""id"": 1655, ""name"": ""country house""}, {""id"": 1879, ""name"": ""shower""}, {""id"": 2341, ""name"": ""nanny""}, {""id"": 2546, ""name"": ""mask""}, {""id"": 5202, ""name"": ""boy""}, {""id"": 9826, ""name"": ""murder""}, {""id"": 12545, ""name"": ""mansion""}, {""id"": 14819, ""name"": ""violence""}, {""id"": 33630, ""name"": ""doll""}, {""id"": 158567, ""name"": ""burn victim""}, {""id"": 171964, ""name"": ""secret passageway""}, {""id"": 176706, ""name"": ""broken mirror""}, {""id"": 204298, ""name"": ""loss of a child""}]",en,"A nanny, working for a family whose son has just passed away, finds herself put in charge of caring for a lifelike doll that the couple treat as a real child.",38.179483,"[{""name"": ""Lakeshore Entertainment"", ""id"": 126}, {""name"": ""Vertigo Entertainment"", ""id"": 829}, {""name"": ""Diamond Films"", ""id"": 2912}, {""name"": ""Showtime Networks"", ""id"": 18880}, {""name"": ""STX Entertainment"", ""id"": 47729}]","[{""iso_3166_1"": ""US"", ""name"": ""United States of America""}, {""iso_3166_1"": ""CN"", ""name"": ""China""}, {""iso_3166_1"": ""CA"", ""name"": ""Canada""}]",1/22/2016,64188367,97,"[{""iso_639_1"": ""en"", ""name"": ""English""}]",Released,Every child needs to feel loved.,The Boy,5.8,1102,0.067959458,0.5,0.5,0.5,0,0,-0.432040542,0.144013514,6.4188367

With Kevin and Garrett away on a fishing trip, Noah catches Claire watching him change clothes through her window.Claire goes on a miserable double date with Vicky and her boyfriend Ethan (Travis Schuldt), and his ill-mannered friend Benny (Bailey Chase). With Kevin still away, Noah calls Claire over to help him cook. She ends up having dinner with him, during which he unashamedly flirts with her. Despite Claires hesitation, she lets Noah seduce her and they have sex. Claire tells Noah that she regrets their night together, causing him to punch a wall in rage. The school year begins, with Noah joining an Claires class after hacking into her computer, making it appear as if she had requested this. Noah manipulates Kevin into hating his father, causing him to lash out at Garrett. Later, Kevin overexerts himself at gym class and goes into shock; Noah saves his life by injecting him with Kevins EpiPen. Claire receives flowers from Noah, and she confronts him about it. Noah witnesses Claire and Garrett together at home after going on a date, viciously escalating his obsession with her and shedding his charismatic demeanor.After an incident where Noah—in defense of Kevin—slams a bullys (Adam Hicks) head into a locker repeatedly, Vicky, who is vice principal at the school, discovers that Noah was kicked out of his previous school for disorderly conduct. After Noah insults her, she expels him. During the fall fling, Claire goes to investigate a leak in the boys bathroom, where she sees the words ""I fucked Claire Peterson"" written on the wall before Noah emerges. He attempts to force himself on her, but she fends him off and demands that he stay away from her and Kevin. The following day, Noah leaves a printer running in Claires classroom, with pictures of them sleeping together scattered everywhere. Later, when Garretts car brakes fail to work, he and Kevin are nearly involved in an accident. Noah blackmails Claire, telling her that he has a video of them having sex, which he will relinquish to her if she continues sleeping with him. She refuses, and has Vicky lure Noah away from his house so she can break in and delete their sex tape. While there, she finds pictures of herself all over the walls and on his laptop; she also finds instructions on how to tamper with the brakes of Garretts car and Noahs parents car.Noah binds and gags Vicky with duct tape and uses a recording of her voice to lure Claire to her house. When Claire arrives, she discovers Vicky dead, her throat slashed by Noah. A horrified Claire contacts the police, but runs into Noah again. She accuses him of killing his parents, and he says his mother killed herself after his father cheated on her, so he caused the accident which killed his father and his mistress. Noah takes Claire to a barn house where he has tied up Garrett and Kevin, threatening to kill them unless Claire stays with him. A violent altercation occurs as Claire attempts to free them. Noah pours kerosene around the barn, causing it to ignite in flames. Garrett frees himself and attempts to choke Noah with a rope, prompting Noah to shoot him in the chest. Claire stabs Noahs eye with Kevins EpiPen. Noah removes the EpiPen from his eye and blindly attempts to strangle Claire to death. When he holds Kevin at gunpoint, she pulls a lever that drops an engine on Noah, killing him. Claire and Kevin then help a wounded Garrett exit the burning barn house as police and paramedics arrive.",4000000,"[{""id"": 53, ""name"": ""Thriller""}]",http://www.theboynextdoorfilm.com/,241251,"[{""id"": 255, ""name"": ""male nudity""}, {""id"": 293, ""name"": ""female nudity""}, {""id"": 572, ""name"": ""sex""}, {""id"": 596, ""name"": ""adultery""}, {""id"": 1326, ""name"": ""infidelity""}, {""id"": 1523, ""name"": ""obsession""}, {""id"": 1936, ""name"": ""blackmail""}, {""id"": 3289, ""name"": ""villain""}, {""id"": 3979, ""name"": ""hidden camera""}, {""id"": 4513, ""name"": ""blind date""}, {""id"": 4959, ""name"": ""death of a friend""}, {""id"": 6255, ""name"": ""insanity""}, {""id"": 6270, ""name"": ""high school""}, {""id"": 6844, ""name"": ""stalker""}, {""id"": 9740, ""name"": ""sociopath""}, {""id"": 10048, ""name"": ""unrequited love""}, {""id"": 10226, ""name"": ""neighbor""}, {""id"": 11510, ""name"": ""unfaithfulness""}, {""id"": 12670, ""name"": ""los angeles""}, {""id"": 12974, ""name"": ""principal""}, {""id"": 13063, ""name"": ""car accident""}, {""id"": 14819, ""name"": ""violence""}, {""id"": 18049, ""name"": ""sex scene""}, {""id"": 34094, ""name"": ""extramarital affair""}, {""id"": 34156, ""name"": ""tied up""}, {""id"": 41019, ""name"": ""car explosion""}, {""id"": 41525, ""name"": ""high school teacher""}, {""id"": 155532, ""name"": ""fatal attraction""}, {""id"": 157499, ""name"": ""mother son relationship""}, {""id"": 157799, ""name"": ""older woman younger man relationship""}, {""id"": 158024, ""name"": ""critically bashed""}, {""id"": 162085, ""name"": ""loss of friend""}, {""id"": 172382, ""name"": ""woman in jeopardy""}, {""id"": 186055, ""name"": ""crying woman""}, {""id"": 188294, ""name"": ""damsel in distress""}, {""id"": 207767, ""name"": ""erotic thriller""}, {""id"": 215938, ""name"": ""muscular""}]",en,"A recently cheated on married woman falls for a younger man who has moved in next door, but their torrid affair soon takes a dangerous turn.",24.161735,"[{""name"": ""Universal Pictures"", ""id"": 33}, {""name"": ""Nuyorican Productions"", ""id"": 1620}, {""name"": ""Blumhouse Productions"", ""id"": 3172}, {""name"": ""Smart Entertainment"", ""id"": 44783}]","[{""iso_3166_1"": ""US"", ""name"": ""United States of America""}]",1/23/2015,52425855,91,"[{""iso_639_1"": ""en"", ""name"": ""English""}]",Released,A Moment She Couldn't Resist.

563,564,The Cabin in the Woods,2012,/wiki/The_Cabin_in_the_Woods,"In a high tech underground facility, controllers Sitterson and Hadley discuss plans for a mysterious operation. A similar operation undertaken by their counterparts in Stockholm has just ended in failure.American college students Dana, Holden, Marty, Jules, and Curt are spending their weekend at a seemingly deserted cabin in the forest. From their control room, Sitterson and Hadley manipulate the students by intoxicating them with mind-altering drugs that hinder rational thinking and increase libido. They take bets from coworkers as to what kind of monster will attack the students and discuss the failures of similar rites in other nations.In the cabins cellar, the group finds many bizarre objects, including the diary of Patience Buckner, a cabin resident abused by her sadistic family. Dana recites incantations from the journal, inadvertently summoning the zombified Buckner family despite Martys warnings. By releasing pheromones, Hadley successfully induces Curt and Jules to have sex. Attacked by the marauding Buckner zombies, Jules is decapitated while Curt escapes to alert the group. Marty, a frequent marijuana smoker, discovers concealed surveillance equipment before being dragged off by one of the Buckners. Later, the facility workers learn that the rite in Japan has also ended in failure, meaning that the American rite is humanitys last hope. It becomes apparent that the rite involves blood sacrifice.Curt, Holden, and Dana attempt to escape in their RV, but Sitterson triggers a tunnel collapse to block them. Curt jumps a ravine on his motorcycle in an attempt to flee and alert the authorities, only to crash into a force field, killing him. Holden and Dana retreat to the RV to plan their next move, but one of the Buckners, hiding within all along, fatally stabs Holden as they are driving away, resulting in the RV crashing and sinking into a lake. Dana escapes and swims ashore and is beset in turn. As she is attacked, Sitterson, Hadley, and their colleagues celebrate the successful completion of the rite, viewing the events from the control room. The celebration is interrupted by a phone call pointing out that Marty has survived. His heavy marijuana use has apparently rendered him immune to Sitterson and Hadleys manipulations.Marty rescues Dana and takes her to a hidden elevator he discovered under a grave. They descend into the underground facility, where a menagerie of monsters is imprisoned. Dana correlates them with the objects in the cabins cellar and realizes that those items gave victims the opportunity to choose the agents of their own deaths during the rite. Cornered by the facilitys security personnel, she and Marty release the monsters, all of which wreak havoc and slaughter the staff; Hadley is killed by a merman and Sitterson escapes to the lower level.Dana and Marty flee the carnage. Dana accidentally mortally wounds Sitterson, who begs her to kill Marty. Fleeing further, they discover an ancient temple and are confronted by the facilitys leader, known only as The Director. She explains that they are participating in an annual ritual sacrifice to appease the Ancient Ones (described as ""giant evil gods""). Each facilitys rite conforms to the rules of that regions local lore; in America young people are chosen to be sacrificed based on similarity to certain archetypes: the whore (Jules), the athlete (Curt), the scholar (Holden), the fool (Marty), and the virgin (Dana). In order to complete the rite, the whore must die first and the virgin must survive or die last. Since all other facilities have failed, the penalty for not completing the rite is the extermination of the entire human race. Hence, The Director urges Dana to kill Marty. Dana considers, but she is interrupted by a werewolf attack, while zombie Patience Buckner appears and kills The Director.Deciding that humanity is not worth saving, Dana and Marty share a joint while awaiting their fate. The temple floor collapses and a giant hand emerges, destroying the facility and the cabin itself.",30000000,"[{""id"": 27, ""name"": ""Horror""}, {""id"": 53, ""name"": ""Thriller""}]",http://www.discoverthecabininthewoods.com/,22970,"[{""id"": 3623, ""name"": ""cabin""}, {""id"": 11422, ""name"": ""plot twist""}, {""id"": 13209, ""name"": ""cabin in the woods""}, {""id"": 182022, ""name"": ""filmed killing""}, {""id"": 182026, ""name"": ""video wall""}, {""id"": 182036, ""name"": ""speaker phone""}, {""id"": 182038, ""name"": ""mounted animal head""}, {""id"": 206298, ""name"": ""young adult""}]",en,"Five college friends spend the weekend at a remote cabin in the woods, where they get more than they bargained for.

564,565,The Call,2013,/wiki/The_Call_(2013_film),"Los Angeles Police Department veteran 9-1-1 operator, Jordan Turner, receives a call one night, from a teenage girl, Leah Templeton, fearing for her life as a man breaks into her home. Jordan calmly advises her to conceal herself upstairs. When the call is disconnected, Jordan calls Leah back, a decision that costs Leah her life. The ringing phone gives her location away to the intruder. Jordan attempts to dissuade him from going further over the phone. He responds ""Its already done"" and hangs up, leaving her distraught. The next day, Jordan sees a television report confirming that Leah has been murdered. Emotionally affected by the incident, Jordan tells her boyfriend, Officer Paul Phillips, that she can no longer handle field calls.Six months later, she is working as a trainer for 9-1-1 operators. Teenager Casey Welson is kidnapped from a mall parking garage by a man named Michael Foster after parting with her friend, Autumn, and forced into the trunk of his car. Casey had taken Autumns disposable phone after she accidentally left it in the mall, and uses it to call 9-1-1. A rookie operator, Brooke, receives the call but is unable to handle it, prompting Jordan to take over. However, Caseys use of a disposable phone means that her location cannot be determined by GPS.  While Michael drives, Jordan guides Casey through knocking out a tail light and signaling people in nearby cars. One woman who sees Casey waving her arm out of the trunk of the car calls 9-1-1, allowing the police to narrow their search. When Casey tells Jordan that there are cans of paint in the trunk, Jordan has Casey pour the paint out of the taillight hole. This attracts the attention of another motorist, Alan Denado, but Michael knocks him out with a shovel, and assuming him to be dead stuffs Alan in the trunk with Casey.  Alan reawakens in the trunk and begins screaming uncontrollably, and Michael stabs him. Michael stops at a gas station where Casey gets an idea to crawl out of the trunk and scream for help. A gas attendant attempts to bust the door open, but Michael sprays him with gasoline and throws a lighter at him. Upon arriving at his destination, Michael removes Casey from the trunk and finds the phone in her pocket, with 9-1-1 listening on the line. Through the phone, Jordan informs him that his identity is uncovered and advises him to turn himself in and not hurt the girl. Before smashing the phone, Michael responds, ""Its already done"", leading Jordan to realize that Michael is the same culprit who killed Leah. Meanwhile, Paul, accompanied by Officer Jake Devans and others in law enforcement, raid Michaels home, but find only his wife and children. Finding a photo of Michael and his sister, Melinda, they realize that Casey resembles her. Additionally, the house seen in the photo is eventually revealed by Michaels wife to have burned down, although a nearby cottage still remains. The police raid it, but find nobody there and leave. Michael begins to wash and cut Caseys hair. Determined to rescue Casey, Jordan drives to the secondary home where she finds a number of photos of Michael with his leukemia-stricken sister. Stepping outside, she recognizes sounds from an outdoor flagpole, reminiscent of sounds heard in the background in the final moments of the 9-1-1 call. She also finds a trap door amid dirt and scrub located where the primary house once stood. Jordan accidentally drops her cellphone down the cellar and climbs down in without calling the police.Navigating the cellar, Jordan hides from an emerging Michael. The cellar itself pieces together Michaels backstory. Michael had incestuous feelings towards his sister and was distraught when she fell ill, lost all of her hair and died of leukemia. Michael has a prop head that he keeps in the cellar that he treats like his sister. He has also been scalping and killing young girls who have similar blond hair, trying to find scalps that match his sisters hair. Jordan soon finds Casey strapped down to a dentist chair and attacks Michael, as he begins to lacerate Caseys scalp. She frees Casey and both make an attempt to escape the cellar, during which Casey stabs Michael in the back with a pair of scissors. Michael pursues them and they are able to injure and kick him back down into the cellar, rendering him unconscious. While he is knocked out, they tie him to a chair. When he regains consciousness, they inform him that they plan to leave him to die and claim that Casey had escaped, that she was found by Jordan in the woods, and that Michael disappeared. Pleading with them that they cannot just leave him there, Jordan replies to Foster using his own words, ""Its already done.""

566,567,The Change-Up,2011,/wiki/The_Change-Up,"One evening, after getting drunk at a bar, Mitch and Dave urinate in a parks fountain, and simultaneously wish that they had each others lives.The next morning, Mitch and Dave realize they have switched bodies. Mitch remembers the wish they made the night before and they drive back to the park, planning to urinate again in the fountain and wish for their original lives back, but find the fountain has been removed for restorations. Forced to wait a few days until the parks department can locate the fountain, Mitch and Dave agree to pretend to be each other for the day. When Mitch arrives at Daves law firm office, he befriends Daves attractive assistant, Sabrina McKay (Olivia Wilde).  However, Mitchs lack of professionalism and legal knowledge cause a big merger to fall through. Meanwhile, Dave arrives at Mitchs film shoot to discover that it is a lorno (light porno).Tired of pretending to be Mitch, Dave has them go back to his house to tell his wife Jamie (Leslie Mann) the truth, but Jamie does not believe him. Dave gives Mitch advice on how to behave professionally and Mitch sets Dave up on a date with Sabrina, who Mitch has had a crush on.After speaking with his father, Mitch rededicates himself to doing everything Daves life demands, from taking care of the kids and buying groceries to making decisions at the firm. On the night of her ballet recital, Cara, Daves eldest child, is about to be pushed by another girl who has a habit of bullying her, but takes Mitchs advice and throws her to the floor, to which Mitch foul-mouthedly cheers. Cara tells Mitch that she loves him and Mitch says the same thing, but feels guilty for doing so immediately after. That night, Mitch and Jamie begin to have sex with each other, but Mitch angrily finds that his guilt will not allow him to become erect, and he admits that he is not cut out for the responsibilities of an adult. Jamie comforts him, and he discreetly rests his head on her breasts.The next day, Dave decides to take advantage of being Mitch and takes the day off. Dave does everything that he finds relaxing, including going to an aquarium and watching a showing of National Lampoons Animal House at the theater and go-karting. After Dave finishes having fun, he calls Mitch to help show him how to act fun on his date with Sabrina that night. Mitch teaches Dave how to act like him, and finally shaves off Daves pubic hair. Sabrina comes to meet him at a classy restaurant and, despite only originally going because Mitch told her to, they eventually legitimately start liking each other, and get tattoos. Dave walks Sabrina home, and she tells him to call her. Later, Jamie asks ""Dave"" about their anniversary party and he asks why Mitch was not invited. She says that he told her not to invite him because he was afraid Mitch would ruin it with his usual antics. Meanwhile, Dave is rollerblading through the park when he is called by the woman from the district managers office and tells him that they found where the statue was moved to. Dave goes to meet Mitch and tell him, but when Dave gets there, he and Mitch imply that they want to stay each other and Dave leaves. However, Mitch forgets about the Dialogue Night that he and Jamie had planned and accidentally stands her up.The following day, Mitch goes with the rest of the representatives to the new merger meeting between the two firms. The Japanese representatives only offer $625 million to merge, $75 million short of their hoped for $700 million. They are about to agree when Mitch says that he has noticed the firms representatives have not started leaving, which means they are still willing to up the price, comparing the whole situation to sex and porn. He tells the moderator to tell the firm they demand $725 million and has Daves firms representatives begin to leave. They successfully scare the other firm into agreeing and celebrate. Mitch and Daves family go to a gala being held by Daves firm in honor of Dave being made partner, but Jamie is still upset over how she knows Dave will still never truly be happy.Meanwhile, Dave and Sabrina are at a baseball game when a thunderstorm suddenly hits, and they decide to go to Mitchs house to wait it out. Sabrina tells Dave that she is going to have sex with him, and takes off her pants and bra, but when they begin, he notices a tattoo of a many-spotted skipperling on her hip, the same type of butterfly his daughter said was her favorite, and regretfully leaves, saying he wants to go home.Back at the gala, Steel is giving his speech about the amazing accomplishments Dave made over the years, and how the only thing he loves more than the law is his family. Mitch says to himself that he did not earn the title he is getting, as Dave quickly drives up to the gala, rushes in, and kisses Jamie, finally letting her know that he is who he said he was. He tells her that he loves her, and he and Mitch drive to the Peachtree Galleria, where the fountain was moved. They run in, planning to urinate in the fountain, but find it located in the center of the Galleria, where it is surrounded by hordes of people walking by. They decide to not wait and do it then, but Mitch finds that he is too embarrassed to urinate, especially after the crowd notices Dave doing so.Mitch asks why Dave did not invite him to his anniversary party, and Dave admits that he was embarrassed of him, but has grown to respect him while he was in his body and this allows Mitch to relax enough to be able to urinate. Mitch and Dave try wishing for their original lives back, but it does not work. Security begins to come to arrest them, but on the third try the Gallerias lights go out, and they both run away before they turn back on. The confused crowd looks around, and the camera pans up to the face of the statue, once again smiling.In the epilogue, Dave is awoken by his babies crying that night, thrilled to realize that he has finally returned in his original body. Dave continually kisses Jamie and happily goes to change the babies. At his home, Mitch awakens to enthusiastically admire himself and happily get breakfast with Sabrina, not realizing that the tattoo Dave got is a picture of his face on Mitchs back with the caption ""I ♥ Dave"". Mitch goes and speaks at his fathers wedding and later attends Daves anniversary a month later.

Their dog Sadie refuses to enter the house, and one of the children, while playing a game of ""hide and clap"", finds a boarded-up entrance to a cellar.Paranormal events occur within the first few nights: all of the clocks stop at exactly 3:07 AM, birds are flying into their windows, and Sadie is found dead in the backyard. One night in bed, Christine encounters a malevolent spirit only she can see, prompting her to claim that the spirit wants her family dead. Another night, Carolyn hears clapping in the hallway. When she goes to investigate, following the noises, she gets trapped in the basement by the spirit. At the same moment, Andrea and Cindy are attacked by the spirit on top of the wardrobe.Carolyn decides to contact demonologists Ed and Lorraine Warren, who have recently investigated a possessed doll called Annabelle. The Warrens agree to take on the case. They conduct an initial investigation and conclude that the house may require an exorcism, but they need authorization from the Catholic Church and further evidence before they can proceed. Ed and Lorraine discover that the house once belonged to an accused witch, Bathsheba (a relative of Mary Towne Eastey), who sacrificed her week-old child to the devil and killed herself in 1863 after cursing all who would take her land. They found reports of numerous murders and suicides in houses that had been built on the property.To gather evidence, Ed and Lorraine place cameras and bells around the house. They see Cindy sleepwalking into Andreas room, and from the EVPs coming from the radio, they hear a spirit luring Cindy into the wardrobe, where she reveals a secret passage inside. Lorraine enters the passage and falls through the floorboards to the cellar, where she sees the spirit of a woman whom Bathsheba had long ago possessed and used to kill her child. The Perron family decides to take refuge at a motel while Ed and Lorraine take their evidence to the Church. The Warrens daughter Judy is attacked in their own home by Bathsheba utilizing Annabelle, though Ed and Lorraine arrive in time to save her. Carolyn, now possessed by Bathsheba, takes Christine and April back to the house. Ed and Lorraine find Carolyn in the cellar trying to stab Christine. After tying Carolyn to a chair, Ed decides that an exorcism needs to be performed on Carolyn, but realizes that there is not enough time to wait for a priest to arrive. Ed decides to perform the exorcism himself, and in the process is attacked by Bathsheba. Though Carolyn escapes and attempts to kill April, Lorraine is able to distract Carolyn from killing her daughter by reminding her of a special memory she shared with her family, allowing Ed to complete the exorcism, saving Carolyn and April and lifting Bathshebas curse forever.Returning home, Lorraine tells Ed that they had been left a message stating that they had gained approval from the Catholic Church to perform the exorcism.

570,571,The Conjuring 2,2016,/wiki/The_Conjuring_2,"In 1976, paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren document the Amityville murders at the Amityville house, to determine if a demonic presence was truly responsible for Ronald DeFeo Jr. killing his entire family on November 13, 1974, and the subsequent haunting incident involving the Lutz family. During a seance, Lorraine is drawn into a vision where she relives the murders. The spirit of one of the children killed appears and lures her to the basement, where she encounters a demonic nun figure, and witnesses Ed being impaled before breaking out of the vision.In 1977, the Hodgson family begins to experience strange occurrences in their home in the London suburb of Enfield. Janet, the second oldest of four children, is seen sleepwalking and conversing in her dreams with an entity in the form of an angry elderly man, who insists that the house is his. Eventually, all the Hodgson siblings and their mother Peggy witness paranormal events occurring right before their eyes, forcing them to seek refuge with their neighbors. When the media attempts to interview the Hodgsons, Janet is possessed by the spirit of the elderly man, Bill Wilkins, who is revealed to have previously lived and died in the house. During the possession, Wilkins states that he enjoys tormenting the family and wants to reclaim his home. As Janet begins to show more signs of demonic possession, the story eventually reaches the Warrens, and their assistance is requested to assist the local church in an investigation to prove whether or not Janets possession is a hoax. Lorraine, fearful that her vision of Eds death may become reality, warns him not to get too involved in the case, but she reluctantly agrees to travel to London with him. She has yet another vision of the demonic nun in Eds study wherein the demon says its name, which Lorraine scribbles in her Bible.While staying at the Hodgson residence, Ed and Lorraine consult with other paranormal investigators, including Maurice Grosse and Anita Gregory, on the legitimacy of the case. They also attempt to communicate with Wilkins spirit, hoping to convince him to stop haunting the family. One night, after the Hodgsons witness Janet being possessed, Gregory presents video evidence of Janet purposely wrecking the kitchen as if for a practical joke, thereby discrediting the haunting. Based on this discovery, Ed and Lorraine feel they have no choice but to leave the family on their own but soon discover that the spirit of Wilkins is only a pawn being manipulated by the demonic nun, to haunt Janet and break her will. Lorraine then realizes that her abilities have been blocked by the demonic nun, preventing her from grasping the truth of Janets possession.Ed and Lorraine quickly return to the Hodgson residence, only to find Janet being possessed once more and the rest of the Hodgsons locked outside the house. Ed ventures inside the house alone. A lightning strike hits a tree near the house, leaving a jagged stump resembling the object that impaled Ed in Lorraines vision. Ed finds Janet standing near the window, ready to leap onto the stump and commit suicide. He manages to grab Janet in time, but finds himself holding onto a curtain that is being torn from its rings by his and Janets weight. Lorraine remembers that she wrote the demons name – Valak – in her Bible. She enters the house and confronts Valak, addressing it by name and successfully condemns it back to Hell. Janet is freed of its possession, and Lorraine pulls her and Ed to safety.After returning home to the United States, Ed adds an item to his and Lorraines collection – ""The Crooked Man"" zoetrope toy owned by Peggys youngest child Billy – placing it near Aprils music box and the Annabelle doll.",40000000,"[{""id"": 27, ""name"": ""Horror""}]",http://www.warnerbros.com/conjuring-2,259693,"[{""id"": 212, ""name"": ""london england""}, {""id"": 392, ""name"": ""england""}, {""id"": 1228, ""name"": ""1970s""}, {""id"": 13153, ""name"": ""spirit""}, {""id"": 14768, ""name"": ""single mother""}, {""id"": 15001, ""name"": ""demon""}, {""id"": 15043, ""name"": ""paranormal investigation""}, {""id"": 161261, ""name"": ""demonic possession""}, {""id"": 228935, ""name"": ""valak""}, {""id"": 228936, ""name"": ""annabelle""}]",en,Lorraine and Ed Warren travel to north London to help a single mother raising four children alone in a house plagued by malicious spirits.,68.794673,"[{""name"": ""New Line Cinema"", ""id"": 12}, {""name"": ""Dune Entertainment"", ""id"": 444}, {""name"": ""The Safran Company"", ""id"": 11565}, {""name"": ""Evergreen Media Group"", ""id"": 31375}, {""name"": ""warner bross Turkey"", ""id"": 47502}, {""name"": ""Soho VFX"", ""id"": 54392}, {""name"": ""Atomic Monster"", ""id"": 76907}]","[{""iso_3166_1"": ""CA"", ""name"": ""Canada""}, {""iso_3166_1"": ""US"", ""name"": ""United States of America""}]",5/13/2016,320170008,134,"[{""iso_639_1"": ""en"", ""name"": ""English""}]",Released,The next true story from the case files of Ed and Lorraine Warren,The Conjuring 2,7,1949,0.10836339,0.177842855,0.168775827,0.5,-0.331224173,0.009067029,-0.069479465,0.136590223,8.0042502
571,572,The Conspirator,2011,/wiki/The_Conspirator,"On April 14, 1865, five days after the Civil War ends with the Souths surrender to the North at Appomattox Court House, Virginia, lawyer and Union veteran Frederick Aiken, with his friends, William Thomas Hamilton and Nicholas Baker, and girlfriend, Sarah Weston, celebrate. Later that same night, Southerner Lewis Payne seriously wounds Secretary of State William Seward in an unsuccessful assassination attempt. German immigrant and carriage repair business owner George Atzerodt is assigned to kill Vice President Andrew Johnson but becomes afraid and runs away. Meanwhile, actor John Wilkes Booth enters Fords Theatre and sees his target, President Abraham Lincoln. Booth sneaks into the Presidents box and shoots Lincoln, mortally wounding him. Booth stabs diplomat and military officer Henry Rathbone who was a guest in Lincolns box, and leaps onto the stage, shouting, ""Sic Semper Tyrannis! The South is avenged!"" before escaping. A crowd, including Aiken, Hamilton and Baker, watch in horror as the unconscious President is taken to a nearby boarding house where he dies early the next morning.Secretary of War Edwin Stanton orders all suspects, including Mary Surratt, arrested. Booth and David Herold manage to evade capture for some days, but Union soldiers find a barn where they suspect the conspirators are hiding and set it on fire. Herold is arrested, while Booth is shot and killed by sergeant Boston Corbett.Maryland Senator Reverdy Johnson is Mary Surratts lawyer. Her son, John Surratt, had escaped with hundreds of agents looking for him. Feeling unable to defend Surratt because hes a Southerner, Reverdy asks Aiken, a Northerner, to take over, but he tries to refuse. He is ordered to defend her and tells Sarah and his friends, who are shocked to hear this.Aiken visits Mary in her cell to question her. Mary asks Aiken to look in on her daughter Anna. Aiken does so and searches the boarding house for clues. He finds a ticket with the initials ""LJW"" (Louis J. Weichmann). At the court, Weichman - a seminary friend of Marys son John, is the first witness and describes John Surratts meetings with Booth. Aiken incriminates Weichman, making him appear as guilty as the rest of the conspirators.Aiken again tries to give up defending Mary, believing her guilty. He meets with her, intending to get evidence of her guilt. She explains that John and the others conspired to kidnap Lincoln, not to kill him. They were about to attack a carriage but were stopped by Booth who reported that Lincoln was elsewhere. She says John left town and went into hiding after this, two weeks before the assassination. Aiken asks Anna for information to help with his trial preparations, but she refuses.At the court, Chief Prosecutor Joseph Holt brings Innkeeper John Lloyd to the stand. Lloyd claims that Mary sent binoculars to Booth and prepared shooting irons and whiskey for Booth and Herold on the night of the assassination. Aiken angers Lloyd, implying that he was bribed for his testimony in whiskey. Lloyd is dragged out of the courtroom after threatening Aiken.While attempting to attend a party at the Century Club, Aiken finds his membership has been revoked due to his defending Mary Surratt. This triggers an argument with Sarah and she disowns and leaves him. Aiken asks Anna to testify next. Anna testifies that Mary had no part in the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, but that it was her brother John instead. Anna visits Aiken at his house and tells him about Booth and John, and sends him to where John Surratt is hiding. He brings the message that John must surrender or his mother will hang for his crimes. On July 6, Mary is found guilty on all charges and, with Stantons intervention, sentenced to hang with three others on the 7th. Aiken procures a writ of habeas corpus to try Mary in civilian court, but President Johnson suspends the writ and Mary is hanged.Sixteen months later, Aiken visits John Surratt, who was captured abroad and is in jail. John thanks him for his kindness to his mother. Aiken offers him Marys rosary but he declines. The epilogue goes on to state that a year later the Supreme Court ruled that citizens were entitled to trial by a civilian jury and not a military tribunal, even in times of war (Ex parte Milligan). A jury of Northerners and Southerners could not agree on a verdict for John Surratt so he was freed.

572,573,The Croods,2013,/wiki/The_Croods,"A cave family called the Croods survives, due to the overprotective nature of their stubborn, stern patriarch, father, Grug. The only one who questions the familys sheltered life is his teenaged daughter Eep, who frequently disobeys her fathers orders out of curiosity, which he finds dangerous. Grug and Eep, along with her mother and his wife Ugga, her grandmother Gran, and her younger brother and sister, Thunk and Sandy, face time sheltered in their cave home.Eep sneaks out when she sees what she discovers to be a torch of fire, and she encounters an inventive modern human boy named Guy and his pet sloth Belt. He warns her of an impending apocalypse and offers to take her with him, but concerned for her family, Eep stays, getting a shell horn from him to blow in case she needs his help. Reuniting with her frantic family, she tries to tell them what Guy told her, but fearing things that are ""different"" and ""new"", they destroy her horn.A massive earthquake then destroys their home, and to avoid carnivores, they descend down into a tropical forest that lay hidden behind their cave all the time. Encountering a ""Macawnivore"", a brightly colored feline that Gran dubs ""Chunky"", the family flees him until he is scared off by swarms of piranhakeets that devour a ground whale. Using another horn, Eep calls to Guy who rescues them from the birds with his fire. After a great deal of confusion regarding their first contact with fire, Grug imprisons Guy in a log until he can guide them somewhere safe. Guy suggests the Croods go to a mountain where there are caves. Grug refuses at first, but he decides to go. The other Croods were worried that they would get tired, but Grug doesnt listen.When Grug finds a bird, he decides to hunt its egg for dinner. Eep also wants to hunt the egg, but as shes grounded, she gets replaced by Thunk, who is too lazy to hunt it. Grug and Thunk fail to capture the birds egg, so they get a scorpion instead. During a fight between Thunk and Gran, Eep notices Guy moving away and stops him. Guy wants Eep to stop, so he makes her hunt with him. Eep goes with Guy to hunt, while the others fight among themselves.Eep and Guy make a trap in order to capture the bird but fail when the two get tangled up, and the bird doesn’t step in the trap. The bird captures the puppet with Guy in it and throws him up in the sky until he lands on the log. Grug asks Guy where Eep is, and he finds her being chased by the bird. Grug gets angry but doesn’t notice that he was about to step on the trap, so Eep pushes him out to save her father. The bird steps on the trap and is thrown up in the sky until it crash-lands on the ground.The Croods cook the bird, and Guy is tied up with a root chain on his right leg. After dinner, Grug tells them a story, which is based on a true story, about a tiger who is similar to Eep and embarrasses Eep. Guy says that his stories never end up like Grug’s stories, so the Croods decide to listen to Guy’s story much to their interest. Guy tells them about a tiger who flew into a place with more suns in the sky called “Tomorrow”. Guy also tells them stories of ""Tomorrow"", a heaven of safety where he is headed and in which curiosity is not deadly as Grug has claimed.Outrunning the destruction, Guy is trusted enough to be let out of the log, and he gives the Croods rudimentary shoes to walk over the harsh landscape as he leads them to a mountain in which he says will be safe. After the family is split up in a labyrinth of tunnels, all but Grug manage to escape by coming up with ideas of overcoming obstacles in their paths. At his treetop home, Grug sees the impression Guy is leaving on his family, and he becomes jealous, especially when he realizes that Eep has fallen in love with Guy. Attempting to invent things like Guy, Grug only further embarrasses himself and drives his family further away from him.Reaching the mountain, Grug tries to force his family to hide out in a cave, but they resist, telling him that they cant live in caves anymore, that they dont want to survive but to live. This enrages Grug, who attacks Guy and both of them end up in a tar flow where Grug learns that Guys family had perished in one. Realizing that Guys method of survival is better for his family, Grug works with him, and they lure Chunky into a trap to free themselves. The family reunites, then flees a massive cataclysm as the land begins to violently rip apart.The family is cut off from their destination by a continental split, but Grug, realizing the errors of his ways, decides to throw his family to safety. He shares an invention he calls a ""hug"" with Eep, briefly before sending her across as well. Cut off from his family, Grug finds a cave for safety, where he encounters Chunky, who is truly a frightened and sweet feline, and he comes up with an idea to getting them across the chasm. Using a ribcage and the Piranhakeets to fashion a simple airship, Grug manages to send themselves, and several animals the family had encountered during their journey, across the chasm, reuniting with his family once again.

575,576,The Dark Knight Rises,2012,/wiki/The_Dark_Knight_Rises,"Eight years after the death of District Attorney Harvey Dent, Batman has disappeared and organized crime has been eradicated in Gotham City thanks to the Dent Act. Police Commissioner James Gordon has kept secret Dents murderous rampage and allowed blame for his crimes to fall on Batman. He writes a resignation speech revealing the truth, but decides that the city is not ready to hear it.Bruce Wayne has become a recluse, and Wayne Enterprises is losing profits after Wayne discontinued his fusion reactor project when he learned that it could be weaponized. Cat burglar Selina Kyle obtains Waynes fingerprints from his home and tries to sell the fingerprints to Waynes corporate rival John Daggett. She is double-crossed at the exchange, but alerts the police. Gordon and the police arrive and pursue Daggetts henchmen into the sewers while Selina flees. The men capture Gordon and take him to Bane, a mysterious masked figure and former member of the League of Shadows, who has set up his base in the sewers. Gordon escapes and is found by rookie officer John Blake. Blake, a fellow orphan, confronts Bruce and convinces him to return as Batman.Bane attacks the Gotham Stock Exchange by using Waynes fingerprints in a transaction that leaves Wayne bankrupt. Waynes butler, Alfred Pennyworth, reveals that Rachel Dawes had intended to marry Dent before she died, and then resigns in an attempt to convince Bruce to move on with his life. Wayne finds comfort in Wayne Enterprises CEO Miranda Tate, who becomes his lover.Kyle agrees to take Batman to Bane but instead leads him into Banes trap. Bane reveals that he intends to fulfill Ras al Ghuls mission to destroy Gotham, and then steals Batmans technology from Wayne Enterprises. Bane fights Batman and delivers a crippling blow to his back, before taking him abroad to an underground prison. There, the inmates tell Wayne the story of Ras al Ghuls child, who was born and raised in the prison before finally escaping — the only prisoner to have done so.Bane lures Gothams police underground and uses explosives to trap them and destroy the bridges surrounding the city. He kills Mayor Anthony Garcia and forces a nuclear physicist to convert the reactor core into an atomic bomb before killing him as well. Bane reads Gordons speech to the public, and releases the prisoners of Blackgate Penitentiary, initiating chaos while holding the city hostage and isolated with the bomb.Months later, a recovered Wayne escapes from the prison and returns to Gotham. Batman frees the trapped police and they clash with Banes army in the streets; during the battle, Batman overpowers Bane. Tate intervenes and stabs Batman, revealing herself to be Talia al Ghul, Ras al Ghuls daughter. She activates the detonator, but Gordon blocks her signal. Talia leaves to find the bomb while Bane prepares to kill Batman, but Kyle arrives and kills Bane. Batman and Kyle pursue Talia, hoping to bring the bomb back to the reactor chamber where it can be stabilized. Talias truck crashes, but she remotely floods and destroys the reactor chamber before dying. With no way to stop the detonation, Batman uses the Bat to haul the bomb far over the bay, where it safely explodes. Before takeoff, Batman reveals his identity to Gordon by mentioning the night his parents were shot as he was on duty at that time and comforted young Bruce afterwards.In the aftermath, Batman is presumed dead and is honored as a hero. With Wayne presumed dead as well, Wayne Manor becomes an orphanage, and his remaining estate is left to Alfred. While visiting Florence, Alfred discovers that Wayne is alive, and in a relationship with Kyle.

576,577,The Darkest Hour,2011,/wiki/The_Darkest_Hour_(film),"Americans Ben and Sean (Max Minghella and Emile Hirsch) travel to Moscow to sell their social networking/party locating software. As they approach the airport, their plane short circuits due to an electrical storm but regains power. After arriving, they find their Swedish business partner, Skyler (Joel Kinnaman), has betrayed them and already made a deal with the Russians, using a knockoff application. They go to a nightclub and meet Natalie (Olivia Thirlby), an American, and her Australian friend Anne (Rachael Taylor). The lights go out in the club and everyone heads outside. There, they witness what appears to be an aurora. Balls of light fall from the sky and then fade away. When a policeman investigates he is quickly disintegrated. The invisible entities begin hunting and killing people, sending them into a panic.Ben, Sean, Natalie, Anne, and now Skyler hide in the clubs storeroom for seven days. With most of their food gone, the group plans to go to the American Embassy. They find the city full of scorched cars and cinders, but empty of people, except for a wary old woman who warns them of ""the ghosts"". Ben and Sean search for supplies in a police car near Red Square while the others hide in the nearby GUM department store shopping mall. While they are searching the car, a barking dog discovers and confronts an alien, but is killed. Ben and Sean successfully hide under the car as the alien moves closer, causing the cars lights and siren to turn on. The alien moves on and the men run to the mall. Sean realizes that light bulbs and other technologies give the aliens away. The group takes shelter in one of the mall stores. Sean and Natalie go to look for clothes and almost run into an alien who cant see them through a glass wall. Sean theorises that the aliens can only see their electrical charge, but not through glass or other insulators.The group finds the American Embassy gutted and lifeless. All except Skyler go to the roof to get an aerial view. They find a logbook telling them that the invasion is worldwide. They also find a radio broadcasting a message in Russian, and hear gunfire. Ben and Sean go outside to help Skyler, but he is killed. The others see a light in a nearby apartment tower and go to investigate, bringing the radio they found. They find a young woman named Vika and a man named Sergei, an electrical engineer. Sergei has made his apartment into a giant Faraday cage that hides everyone from the aliens. He has also developed a microwave gun that weakens an aliens force field, so that it can actually be seen and killed. Vika and Sergei translate the message, which says that a nuclear submarine K-152 Nerpa is waiting in the Moscow River to take survivors to safety.As Sergei shows the men the microwave device, Vika, Natalie, and Anne go to other apartments to gather supplies for the submarine journey. An alien senses them outside the Faraday cage and gives chase; Anne hesitates following Vika and goes another way, causing Natalie to follow her back inside. When they get to the apartment, Natalie is unable to close the door and the alien gets inside. Sergei shoots the alien with his gun and finds that it is only stunned. The alien kills Sergei while the others get out by the fire escape. Anne hesitates again and is killed while trying to escape. Natalie sets the apartment on fire as they climb down and meet up with Vika.They meet up with a Russian police team with improvised armor led by Boris who manage to wound an alien with conventional weapons. Sean collects a piece of the aliens body. The small police band were also able to build another Faraday cage at the Russian State Library. Boris and his men eventually agree to help the remaining four to get to the submarine. The policemen believe that the aliens are strip mining for conductive metals since giant light columns can be seen drilling all over Moscow. As they move through the subway, an alien discovers them and they escape on the tracks. Vika hides behind a pillar, unable to join the others without being seen. Ben helps her climb down to the tracks, but is killed by the alien.The survivors make it to a powerless patrol boat on the river and drift downstream to the waiting submarine. The boat nears the submarine but runs aground. As they attempt to push free, a new light beam destroys a large apartment building right next to the river, causing the boat to capsize. Sean and the policemen swims towards the submarine but upon reaching it discover Natalie is missing. They see a flare fired from Natalies flare gun in a railway and bus yard near the river. Sean is determined to get her, possibly missing his chance to escape. The policemen agree to help him rescue her. The Russian submarine crew, after expressing doubt about the rescue, assist by building another microwave gun with stronger batteries.After the team manages to destroy an alien, Sean finds Natalie on a bus while the policemen and Vika destroy three more aliens using the microwave guns and water. As Sean is about to get off the bus with Natalie, an alien climbs on board, locks the door, and sends the bus speeding around the bus yard. It grabs onto Natalies leg, but Sean blasts the aliens shield with the microwave gun. He then discovers the aliens weakness when he throws a piece of the wounded alien he had collected earlier, and it destroys the unshielded alien. The two stop the bus and narrowly avoid a collision.After returning to the submarine, the police team decides to stay and fight for the city, and Boris tells them that now the war has begun. Sean, Natalie, and Vika plan to spread what they learned about the aliens - the microwave guns and their vulnerability to pieces of other dead aliens - to the rest of the world. Sean and Natalie, the only survivors of the original group along with Vika, nearly share a kiss on the submarine. In a pre-credit scene, as the submarine cruises through the Caspian Sea, they learn that survivors in Paris managed to destroy an alien mining tower.",30000000,"[{""id"": 27, ""name"": ""Horror""}, {""id"": 28, ""name"": ""Action""}, {""id"": 53, ""name"": ""Thriller""}, {""id"": 878, ""name"": ""Science Fiction""}]",http://www.darkesthourmovie.com/,71469,"[{""id"": 14909, ""name"": ""alien invasion""}, {""id"": 34061, ""name"": ""american abroad""}, {""id"": 186450, ""name"": ""moscow""}, {""id"": 221871, ""name"": ""unlikely heroes""}, {""id"": 221872, ""name"": ""failed business""}]",en,"In Moscow, five young people lead the charge against an alien race which has attacked Earth via our power supply.",23.328823,"[{""name"": ""Summit Entertainment"", ""id"": 491}, {""name"": ""Regency Enterprises"", ""id"": 508}, {""name"": ""Bazelevs Production"", ""id"": 1038}, {""name"": ""The Jacobson Company"", ""id"": 3638}, {""name"": ""New Regency Pictures"", ""id"": 10104}]","[{""iso_3166_1"": ""US"", ""name"": ""United States of America""}, {""iso_3166_1"": ""RU"", ""name"": ""Russia""}]",12/22/2011,64626786,89,"[{""iso_639_1"": ""en"", ""name"": ""English""}]",Released,Survive The Holidays,The Darkest Hour,4.8,469,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0,0,0,0,2.1542262

David recognises Stefan waiting in another vehicle and unable to face their lie, he commits suicide by stepping in front of an oncoming truck.In 1965, a young Mossad agent Rachel Singer on her first field assignment arrives in East Berlin to meet with more experienced agents David Peretz and Stefan Gold. Their mission is to capture Nazi war criminal Dieter Vogel—infamously known as ""The Surgeon of Birkenau"" for his medical experiments on Jews during World War II—and bring him to Israel to face justice. Rachel and David present themselves as a married couple from Argentina and Rachel becomes a patient at Vogels obstetrics and gynaecology clinic.At a doctor appointment, Rachel injects Vogel with a sedative during an examination and induces the nurse to believe that he has suffered a heart attack. Stefan and David arrive dressed as paramedics and make off with the unconscious Vogel in an ambulance. They attempt to leave by train, but Vogel awakens and sounds the horn of the van where he is being held, alerting guards to their presence. In the ensuing shootout, David sacrifices his chance to escape in order to save the compromised Rachel. The agents have no choice but to bring Vogel to their apartment and plan a new extraction.The agents take turns monitoring and feeding Vogel while leaving him chained to the wall heater. During his shift, David becomes violently enraged after Vogel explains his beliefs that Jews have many weaknesses, such as selfishness, making them easily subdued. David smashes a glass plate over Vogels head and repeatedly beats him, only to be stopped and restrained by Stefan. Later on, Stefan and David go out, leaving Rachel home to monitor Vogel by herself. After managing to cut through his bonds using a shard of the broken plate, Vogel ambushes Rachel with the shard, leaving her with a permanent scar on her face and escapes. Panicking and hoping to save face, Stefan convinces Rachel and David to go along with the fiction that Vogel was killed. They agree to lie and use the cover story that Rachel shot and killed Vogel as he attempted to flee.In the following years, the agents become venerated as national heroes for their roles in the mission. At a dinner after their daughters book release party, Stefan takes Rachel aside to set a meeting to discuss new information he has obtained. Later, at Davids flat, Stefan provides evidence that Vogel is in an insane asylum in Ukraine, and is soon scheduled to be interviewed by a local journalist.David had been investigating the man at Stefans request and killed himself out of fear that the lie would be exposed. Rachel refutes Stefans explanation, recalling an encounter with David a day before his suicide, in which he revealed his shame about the lie and disclosed that he had spent years unsuccessfully searching the world for Vogel. He was further disheartened by Rachels admission that she would continue propagating the lie to protect those closest to her, particularly her daughter.Nevertheless, at the direction of Mossad, Rachel finally feels compelled to travel to Kiev. She investigates the journalists lead and is able to travel to the asylum. She reaches the room just minutes before the journalist and discovers the man claiming to be Vogel is not him. Describing the encounter to Stefan over the phone, Rachel declares she will not continue to lie about the 1965 mission. She leaves a note for the journalist and suddenly spots the real Vogel among the other patients and follows him to an isolated area of the hospital.After a confrontation in which Vogel stabs her twice with scissors, Rachel kills Vogel by plunging a poisoned syringe into his back. Later Rachels note is discovered and read by the journalist.

578,579,The Descendants,2011,/wiki/The_Descendants,"Matthew ""Matt"" King is a Honolulu-based attorney and the sole trustee of a family trust of 25,000 pristine acres on Kauai. The land has great monetary value, but is also a family legacy. While Matt has always ably managed his own finances, most of his cousins have squandered their inheritances. With the trust expiring in seven years due to the rule against perpetuities, the King clan is pressuring Matt to sell the land for hundreds of millions of dollars. Amidst these discussions, a boating accident has rendered Matts wife, Elizabeth, comatose. With Elizabeth hospitalized, Matt is forced to cope with his two troubled daughters, 10-year-old Scottie who seeks attention by bullying other children, and 17-year-old Alex who has a history of substance abuse and is away at a private boarding school on the Big Island. Doctors determine that Elizabeths coma is irreversible and her living will directs all life support to be discontinued. When Matt tells Alex, she reveals that she caught Elizabeth having an affair before the accident, causing a major rift between mother and daughter.Two close family friends tell Matt that Elizabeth was unhappy and wanted to leave him for her lover, Brian Speer, a real estate agent. After Matt arranges for friends to bid Elizabeth goodbye, he decides Speer should also have an opportunity. He and the girls, and also Alexs slacker boyfriend Sid, travel to Kauai to find Brian. While there, Matts cousin Hugh mentions that Brian is brother-in-law to Don Hollitzer, the developer to whom the family wants to sell the land. Brian stands to make a small fortune from the sales commission. Matt confronts Brian and informs him Elizabeth is dying and offers him an opportunity to see her one last time. Brian declines, admitting that although Elizabeth was in love with him, it was only a fling to him and that he loves his wife Julie and their children, then apologizes to Matt for the pain he caused.When Elizabeth is disconnected from life support, her father Scott admonishes Matt for not being a more generous and loving husband. Choosing not to disclose the details of her affair to Scott, Matt agrees, but Sid and Alex both unexpectedly defend Matt. At the King family meeting, Matt overrules the majority of his cousins who favor selling to Hollitzer. Matt decides to keep the land and look for a different solution to the problem posed by the rule against perpetuities. Shocked, Hugh tells Matt that he and the other cousins will take legal action if Matt refuses to sell, but Matt is undeterred.After learning of Brians affair with Elizabeth and realizing that he will not visit, Julie comes to the hospital. She tearfully admits to Elizabeth that she wants to hate her for ""trying to destroy"" her family, but that she forgives her. Matt finally comes to terms with his wifes betrayal and her impending death. He kisses her goodbye, followed by Alex and Scottie, and later, they scatter Elizabeths ashes in the ocean off Waikiki. Later, the three are at home sitting together sharing ice cream and watching television, all wrapped in the Hawaiian quilt Elizabeth had been lying in.",20000000,"[{""id"": 35, ""name"": ""Comedy""}, {""id"": 18, ""name"": ""Drama""}]",http://www.foxsearchlight.com/thedescendants/,65057,"[{""id"": 1668, ""name"": ""hawaii""}, {""id"": 4604, ""name"": ""father-in-law""}, {""id"": 5600, ""name"": ""daughter""}, {""id"": 11501, ""name"": ""cheating wife""}, {""id"": 34145, ""name"": ""beach house""}, {""id"": 155879, ""name"": ""boating accident""}, {""id"": 155881, ""name"": ""estate""}, {""id"": 155882, ""name"": ""dying mother""}, {""id"": 155884, ""name"": ""beautiful girl""}, {""id"": 155888, ""name"": ""teenage daughter""}, {""id"": 155891, ""name"": ""trustee""}, {""id"": 155892, ""name"": ""trust fund""}, {""id"": 155894, ""name"": ""wild girl""}, {""id"": 155896, ""name"": ""wild child""}, {""id"": 177259, ""name"": ""realtor""}]",en,"With his wife Elizabeth on life support after a boating accident, Hawaiian land baron, Matt King takes his daughters on a trip from Oahu to Kauai to confront the young real estate broker, who was having an affair with Elizabeth before her misfortune.",40.903931,"[{""name"": ""Fox Searchlight Pictures"", ""id"": 43}, {""name"": ""Dune Entertainment"", ""id"": 444}, {""name"": ""Ad Hominem Enterprises"", ""id"": 2361}]","[{""iso_3166_1"": ""US"", ""name"": ""United States of America""}]",9/9/2011,177243185,115,"[{""iso_639_1"": ""en"", ""name"": ""English""}]",Released,The South Pacific ain't that terrific.,The Descendants,6.7,934,0.190125436,0.747895598,0.281667799,0.156247735,0.125420064,0.4662278,-0.557770163,0.383139342,8.86215925
579,580,The Devil Inside,2012,/wiki/The_Devil_Inside_(film),"On October 30, 1989, Maria Rossi committed a triple murder during an exorcism performed on her. The Catholic Church became involved, and she has since been in a Catholic psychiatric hospital in Rome. A news story and police investigation show the three members of the clergy whom she murdered. Her daughter, Isabella, learned of the murders from her father, who died three days after telling her.Twenty years later, Isabella is in the process of filming a documentary with filmmaker Michael Schaefer about exorcisms and, to find out more about her mother, she visits a school in Rome. She meets two priests, Ben Rawlings and David Keane, before going to see her mother Maria in the asylum. She finds that her mother speaks in different accents and has paintings all over the walls. Maria then soils herself while screaming in an unidentified language. She has inverted crosses carved into her arms and her bottom lip and tells Isabella that killing a child is against Gods will. Isabella tells the priests that she had an abortion years ago and her mother had no way of knowing that—another sign that showed possible possession. David and Ben take her with them on an unsanctioned exorcism performed on Rosalita, a young woman. They bring medical equipment to determine if it is possession or mental illness. Rosalita calls Isabella by her name, despite not knowing her, and attacks the crew after spouting out obscene remarks in different languages and accents. Eventually, they get her under control.As the crew discusses performing an exorcism and analysis on Maria, David worries about losing his job, since the Church does not authorize exorcisms without undeniable proof that the patient is indeed possessed. They persuade him to aid in the process. During the procedure, Maria mentions knowing what Ben did in the past and transfers demons to David and Isabella. The process is stopped by hospital workers and is unsuccessful.After analyzing the data from the video and audio files, they present the evidence to the Church. David shows many signs of stress, as Ben repeatedly plays the audio files. Ben finds that there are four different demons speaking in unison. David is to perform a baptism at his church, which Michael tags along to record. When he holds the baby to start the immersion baptism, he mutters some lines from the Bible and starts forcefully submerging the baby in the holy water. The crowd rushes up to save the baby as he passes out.Soon after, Ben finds David at home with blood all over his forearms, much the way Maria was during the exorcism. The police arrive, and David acquires an officers handgun and holds it in his mouth. Ben tells him to fight it, but he begins to weep, reciting the Lords Prayer, and forgets the last few words. He laughs and shoots himself. Isabella begins having a seizure.Ben hysterically comes to the realization that Isabella is possessed. Ben and Michael leave with Isabella in a car, heading to get help for a potential exorcism. While Michael drives, Isabella speaks of also knowing the horrible act Ben committed, scaring Ben. She tries to strangle Michael and breathes into his mouth. He instantly shows signs of possession, unbuckling his seatbelt and accelerating into oncoming traffic. The car collides, and the corpses of Michael and Ben sit in the overturned car while Isabella is not visible.A title card is shown informing that the case of the Rossi family is still unresolved, followed by another title card directing viewers to a website ""for more information on the ongoing investigation"".",1000000,"[{""id"": 53, ""name"": ""Thriller""}, {""id"": 27, ""name"": ""Horror""}]",http://www.devilinsidemovie.com,76487,"[{""id"": 588, ""name"": ""rome""}, {""id"": 2626, ""name"": ""exorcism""}, {""id"": 34079, ""name"": ""death""}, {""id"": 161261, ""name"": ""demonic possession""}, {""id"": 163053, ""name"": ""found footage""}]",en,"In Italy, a woman becomes involved in a series of unauthorized exorcisms during her mission to discover what happened to her mother, who allegedly murdered three people during her own exorcism.",13.152822,"[{""name"": ""Room 101"", ""id"": 6302}, {""name"": ""Prototype"", ""id"": 24048}]","[{""iso_3166_1"": ""US"", ""name"": ""United States of America""}]",1/6/2012,101758490,83,"[{""iso_639_1"": ""en"", ""name"": ""English""}]",Released,No soul is safe.,The Devil Inside,4.6,262,0.119458497,0.5,0.5,0.5,0,0,-0.380541503,0.126847168,101.75849
580,581,The Dictator,2012,/wiki/The_Dictator_(2012_film),"For years, the fictional nation of the Republic of Wadiya has been ruled by Admiral-General Aladeen (Sacha Baron Cohen), a childish, tyrannical, sexist, anti-western, and antisemitic despot who surrounds himself with female bodyguards, sponsors al-Qaeda (specially giving shelter to Osama Bin Laden after ""they killed his double one year ago""), changes many words in the dictionary to ""Aladeen"", and is working on developing nuclear weapons to attack Israel. He also refused to sell Wadiyas oil fields, a promise he made to his father on his deathbed. After the United Nations Security Council resolves to intervene militarily, Aladeen travels to the UN Headquarters in New York City to address the council.Shortly after arriving, Aladeen is kidnapped by Clayton (John C. Reilly), a hitman hired by his treacherous uncle Tamir (Ben Kingsley), whom Aladeens father passed over as successor in favour of his son. Tamir then replaces Aladeen with a dimwitted political decoy named Efawadh (Baron Cohen), whom he intends to manipulate into signing a document nominally democratizing Wadiya while opening up the countrys oil fields to Chinese and other foreign vested interests. Aladeen escapes after Clayton accidentally kills himself in a botched torture attempt; when his burnt corpse is discovered, Tamir thinks Aladeen has been killed. However, Aladeen is practically unrecognisable as Clayton shaved off his iconic long beard prior to his death.Wandering through New York City, Aladeen encounters Zoey (Anna Faris), a human rights activist who offers him a job at her socially progressive, alternative lifestyle co-op. Aladeen refuses the offer and encounters ""Nuclear"" Nadal (Jason Mantzoukas), the former chief of Wadiyas nuclear weapons programme, whom Aladeen thought he had previously executed over an argument about the warheads shape. Aladeen follows him to New Yorks ""Little Wadiya"" district, which is populated by refugees from his own country, and meets him in ""Death to Aladeen Restaurant"", run by and visited by numerous people whom Aladeen had personally ordered to be executed. Nadal saves Aladeen from nearly being recognised by angry refugees and reveals that rebels infiltrated the secret police, and all the condemned were sent into exile instead of being executed. Nadal agrees to help Aladeen thwart Tamirs plot and regain his position as ""rightful"" dictator, on condition that Aladeen makes him head of Wadiyas WMD programme again. Aladeen agrees and accepts Zoeys job offer, as she is catering at the hotel where the signing is to occur. Aladeen grows closer to Zoey after she refuses his sexual advances and teaches him how to masturbate, and eventually falls in love with her after seeing her angry. Turning around Zoeys struggling business, Aladeen begins imposing strict schedules on everyone, forming a personality cult around Zoey and intimidating an inspector into giving the store a good review.However, Aladeens relationship with Zoey becomes strained after he decides to be honest with her and reveal his true self; she cannot love a man who was so brutal to his own people. After acquiring a new beard taken from a corpse, Aladeen ziplines into the hotel and tells Efawadh he has recovered; (his double being fooled into thinking the Supreme Leader was ill). At the signing ceremony, he tears up Tamirs document in front of the UN delegation, and holds an impassioned speech praising the virtues of dictatorship, drawing unintended parallels to current issues in the United States. However, upon seeing Zoey in the room, he declares his love for her and, knowing Zoeys strongly held views, vows to democratise his country and open up Wadiyas oil fields for business, but in a way where the general populace will benefit. Angry with Aladeen staying in power, Tamir attempts to assassinate him but Efawadh jumps in front of the bullet and survives, as it is his job ""to be shot in the head"". Tamir, afterwards, is arrested.A year later, Wadiya holds its first democratic elections, although they are rigged in favour of Aladeen (who has now added the titles President–Prime Minister to his previous Admiral-General). Afterwards, he marries Zoey, but is shocked when she crushes a glass and reveals herself to be Jewish; throughout the film he was shown vowing to ""destroy Israel"". Scenes during the credits show Aladeens convoy, now consisting of eco-friendly cars, visiting a reinstated Nadal, and later Zoey revealing in a television interview that she is pregnant with the couples first child.

586,587,The Expendables 3,2014,/wiki/The_Expendables_3,"The Expendables—led by Barney Ross and formed by Lee Christmas, Gunner Jensen, and Toll Road—extract former member Doctor Death, a knives specialist and team medic, from a military prison during his transfer on a train. They recruit Doc to assist them in intercepting a shipment of bombs meant to be delivered to a warlord in Somalia. Arriving there, they reunite with Hale Caesar, who directs them to the drop point, where Ross is surprised to find out that the arms trader providing the bombs is Conrad Stonebanks, a former co-founder of the Expendables who went rogue and was presumed dead. In the ensuing firefight, The Expendables kill all but Stonebanks, who shoots Caesar. They are forced to retreat due to Stonebanks advanced weaponry, and Caesar is severely injured.Back at the United States, CIA operative Max Drummer, the Expendables new missions manager, gives Ross a mission to capture Stonebanks to bring him to the International Criminal Court to be tried for war crimes. Blaming himself for Caesars injuries, Ross disbands the Expendables and leaves for Las Vegas, where he enlists retired mercenary-turned-recruiter Bonaparte to help him find a new team of younger mercenaries. The recruits include former U.S. Marine John Smilee, nightclub bouncer Luna, computer expert Thorn, and weapons expert Mars. Skilled sharpshooter Galgo asks to be included in the team, but Ross turns him down.The new team members rendezvous with Rosss rival Trench Mauser, returning a favor for Ross. Drummer has traced Stonebanks to Romania, where he is set to make an arms deal. Ross and the new recruits infiltrate an office building Stonebanks is using and, having to kill a few men in the process including arms buyer Goran Vata, capture Stonebanks. In transit, Stonebanks taunts Ross and explains why he betrayed The Expendables.  Ross nearly kills him to shut him up but, despite Stonebanks egging him on, he stands down. Stonebanks men catch up to them, with the aid of his GPS Tracker, and fire a missile at the teams van. Ross is thrown into a river, while Smilee, Luna, Thorn and Mars are captured by Stonebanks crew. Ross kills Stonebanks retrieval team and escapes.Stonebanks sends Ross a video, challenging Ross to come after him and giving him his location in Azmenistan. While preparing to leave and mount a rescue alone, Ross is found by Galgo, who offers his services again. Ross accepts, later accompanied by the veteran Expendables. They rescue the young mercenaries, only to learn from Stonebanks that he has rigged the place with explosives. As both the young and veteran Expendables fight one another, Ross convinces them to work together to take down Stonebanks. As the final battle begins, Thorn uses a jammer device to delay the countdown, giving them just under half an hour before detonation. Stonebanks orders the armed forces of Azmenistan to attack the building with full force, including tanks and attack helicopters. Drummer and Trench arrive in a helicopter to help, alongside returning Expendables member Yin Yang.The new and veteran members of the Expendables work together to kill Stonebanks men. When a second wave moves in, Drummer lands on the building to evacuate the team. As everyone makes it to Drummers chopper, Stonebanks personally attacks Ross after shooting him down. Having been forced to remove the armor and his weapon, Ross and Stonebanks engage in hand-to-hand combat. Both are evenly matched, but Ross knocks down Stonebanks before they both reach for their guns. Stonebanks shoots, but Ross gets the better of him. At his mercy, Stonebanks questions Ross about delivering him to the International Criminal Court. Ross coldly shoots Stonebanks in response. Seconds after Stonebanks death, the batteries of Thorns device run out, causing the building to explode and collapse. The team makes it to Drummers helicopter and flies away to safety, as Ross clings to it from the outside. In the aftermath, Caesar recovers from his wounds, and Ross officially accepts Galgo, Smilee, Luna, Thorn, and Mars into the team.

588,589,The Fighter,2010,/wiki/The_Fighter,"Micky Ward is an American welterweight boxer from Lowell, Massachusetts. Managed by his mother, Alice Ward, and trained by his older half-brother, Dicky Eklund, Micky became a ""stepping stone"" for other boxers to defeat on their way up. Dicky, a former boxer whose peak of success was going the distance with Sugar Ray Leonard in 1978, has become addicted to crack cocaine. He is being filmed for an HBO documentary he believes to be about his ""comeback"".On the night of an undercard fight in Atlantic City, Mickys scheduled opponent is ill, and a substitute is found who is 20 pounds heavier than Micky, a huge difference in professional boxing, constituting two or three weight classes. Despite Mickys reservations, his mother and brother agree so that they can all get the purse and Micky is defeated. Micky retreats from the world and forms a relationship with Charlene Fleming, a former college athlete who dropped out and became a bartender.After several weeks, Alice arranges another fight for Micky, but Micky is concerned it will turn out the same. His mother and seven sisters blame Charlene for his lack of motivation. Micky mentions he received an offer to be paid to train in Las Vegas, but Dicky says he will match the offer so he can keep training and working with his family. Dicky then tries to get money by posing his girlfriend as a prostitute and then, once she picks up a client, impersonating a police officer to steal the clients money. This is foiled by the actual police and Dicky is arrested after a chase and a fight with them. Micky tries to stop the police from beating his brother and a police officer brutally breaks his hand before arresting him. At their arraignment, Micky is released, but Dicky is sent to jail. Micky washes his hands of Dicky.On the night of the HBO documentarys airing, Dickys family, and Dicky himself in prison, are horrified to see that it is called Crack in America and depicts how crack addiction ruined Dickys career and life. Dicky begins training and trying to get his life together in prison. Micky is lured back into boxing by his father, who believes Alice and his stepson Dicky are bad influences. The other members of his training team and a new manager, Sal Lanano, persuade Micky to return to boxing with the explicit understanding that his mother and brother will no longer be involved. They place Micky in minor fights to help him regain his confidence. He is then offered another major fight against an undefeated up-and-coming boxer. During a prison visit, Dicky advises Micky on how best to work his opponent, but Micky feels his brother is being selfish and trying to restart his own failed career. During the actual match, Micky is nearly overwhelmed, but then implements his brothers advice and triumphs; he earns the title shot for which his opponent was being groomed.Upon his release from prison, Dicky and his mother go to see Micky train. Assuming things are as they were, Dicky prepares to spar with his brother, but Micky informs him that he is no longer allowed per Mickys agreement with his current team. In the ensuing argument, in which Micky chastises both factions of his family, Charlene and his trainer leave in disgust. Micky and Dicky spar until Micky knocks Dicky down. Dicky storms off, presumably to get high again, and Alice chides Micky, only to be sobered when he tells her that she has always favored Dicky. Dicky returns to his crack house, where he says goodbye to his friends and heads to Charlenes apartment. He tells her that Micky needs both of them and they need to work together. After bringing everyone back together, the group goes to London for the title fight against welterweight champion Shea Neary. Micky scores another upset victory and the welterweight title.

589,590,The Final Destination,2011,/wiki/The_Final_Destination,"In 2009, College student Nick OBannon visits the McKinley Speedway with his girlfriend Lori Milligan and their friends Hunt Wynorski and Janet Cunningham. While watching the race, Nick has a premonition of a horrible car accident that sends debris into the stands, causing the stadium to collapse. When Nick panics, a fight breaks out and several people leave the stadium, including Lori, Hunt, Janet, security guard George Lanter, mechanic Andy Kewzer, his girlfriend Nadia Monroy, racist tow truck driver Carter Daniels, and mother Samantha Lane. As Nadia berates the group, a stray tire flies out of the stadium and decapitates her.Several days after the accident, Carter tries to set a fire on Georges lawn for preventing him from saving his wife, but a chain reaction causes him to be dragged down the street on fire before his tow truck explodes. The next day, Samantha is leaving the beauty salon when a rock propelled by a lawn mower is shot through her eye, killing her. After reading about the events in the newspaper and the past disasters, Nick becomes convinced that Death is after them. Hunt and Janet dont believe them, but they manage to convince George to help. The group visits the mechanic shop to warn Andy, but he is killed when a CO2 tank launches him through a chain link fence. After receiving a premonition involving water, Nick tries to warn Hunt, who has gone to a country club pool. At the same time, George and Lori try to find Janet, who becomes trapped in a malfunctioning car wash, and they narrowly manage to save her. Hunt drops his lucky coin in the water after accidentally turning the pools drain on. When he dives in, he is sucked down to the drain, where the increasing suction eventually sucks his organs through the drain pipe. Afterward, George admits that he tried to commit suicide several times, but all attempts have failed. Nick believes saving Janet must have ruined Deaths plan and the group celebrates.Four days later, Nick begins to see more omens and remembers asking cowboy Jonathan Groves to switch seats prior to the accident, meaning he is next. Nick and George track Jonathan down at a hospital, where he remained in traction recovering from the accident. They witness him being crushed by an overflowing bathtub that falls through the ceiling. As they leave, George is suddenly hit by a speeding ambulance and Nick realizes that Lori and Janet are still in danger. He tracks them down at a mall cinema and convinces Lori to leave, but Janet refuses and is killed by flying debris when a chain reaction causes the screen to explode. A multitude of explosions race Nick and Lori through the mall until they are trapped on a malfunctioning escalator, Lori is dragged into the gears and killed. This turns out to be another premonition, but George is killed by the ambulance before Nick can warn him.At the mall, Lori begins seeing omens as well. Having failed in his premonition, Nick runs back to the mall to stop the explosion before it occurs. He is pinned to a wall by a nail gun but manages to stop the fire before it spreads to several combustible barrels, saving everyone. Two weeks later, Nick notices a loose scaffold prop while heading into a café and warns a construction worker about it before going inside.

590,591,The Finest Hours,2016,/wiki/The_Finest_Hours_(2016_film),"Bernard ""Bernie"" Webber, a crewman at the Coast Guard station in Chatham, Massachusetts, on Cape Cod, has fallen in love with a local girl, Miriam Pentinen.  The two plan to marry on April 16, but in accordance with Coast Guard regulations, Bernie must seek permission from the stations commander, Daniel Cluff. On the day he is due to ask permission, February 18, 1952, the oil tanker SS Pendleton shears in half off the Chatham coast after getting caught in a noreaster. With the majority of the stations crew already underway with the rescue of the similarly damaged SS Fort Mercer, Bernie is dispatched to pilot motor lifeboat CG 36500 to rescue the crew of Pendleton. Andrew Fitzgerald, Ervin Maske, and Richard P. Livesey volunteer to join Bernie on the rescue mission.Meanwhile, the Pendletons engineer, Ray Sybert, as the surviving senior officer, organizes the surviving seamen to steer the sinking stern of the tanker onto a submerged reef, where it can lodge until rescuers arrive.When Miriam hears that Bernie is leading the rescue effort, she, like a number of townspeople, thinks this is a suicide mission.  Few people in Chatham trust Cluff, since he is not from the area and does not know its treacherous weather. Miriam drives to the station, demanding that Cluff call Bernie back. Cluff refuses, and brusquely orders Miriam out.Between Chatham Harbor and the open sea lies a bar, a series of shoals that are very dangerous even in good weather. Bernie must time bursts of his engine to ride each approaching wave before it breaks as he pilots CG 36500 across the bar. Although he makes it over the bar, he loses his compass.Bernie steers CG 36500 to the stricken tanker. Although his boats designated capacity is only 12 people, Bernie manages to rescue 32 crewmen. The stern of Pendleton begins sinking more rapidly during the rescue and goes down shortly after the last crewman comes aboard Bernies boat.  Relying on his knowledge of the coast and prevailing winds in place of his compass, Bernie steers CG 36500 toward home—a task made more difficult as Chatham loses power. Miriam and the other townspeople drive their cars to the pier and turn on their headlights to guide Bernie in.The film shows photographs from the event that briefly document the aftermath of the rescue. Two months later, Bernie and Miriam marry; they stay together for 58 years until Bernies death in 2009.

591,592,The Five-Year Engagement,2012,/wiki/The_Five-Year_Engagement,"Tom Solomon (Jason Segel), a sous chef at a fancy restaurant, and Violet Barnes (Emily Blunt), a psychology PhD graduate, are a happy couple in San Francisco who get engaged a year after they began dating. Their nuptials get interrupted when Toms best friend Alex Eilhauer (Chris Pratt) gets Violets sister Suzie (Alison Brie) pregnant at Tom and Violets engagement party and the two marry before Tom and Violet. Their nuptials get further delayed when Violet gets accepted into the University of Michigans post-doctorate in psychology program which lasts two years. Tom agrees to move with her and delay their wedding until then. However, when he tells his boss, he becomes disheartened when she states she was planning on making him head chef at a new restaurant in town.In Michigan, Violet settles into her new job nicely under her professor Winton Childs (Rhys Ifans). She bases her main thesis on people opting to eat stale donuts versus waiting for fresh donuts, associating impulse-control problems with personal and professional instability. However, Tom, unable to find a suitable chefs position, ends up working at Zingermans and taking up hunting. Tom and Violets nuptials get delayed even further when Winton receives NIH funding with Violets help, enabling him to extend her program. In the meantime, grandparents of Violet start to die.As years pass, Tom becomes increasingly disillusioned with his life, which becomes evident to Violet when she sees him eat a stale donut. While at a bar with colleagues, a drunken Violet and Winton kiss each other which Violet immediately regrets. She then visits Tom at work and tells him she wants to plan their wedding now, to which Tom happily agrees. Tom cleans himself up and they make arrangements together. Everything goes well until Violet decides to confess to Tom about kissing Winton. Tom gets disillusioned about their relationship, which reaches a climax when Winton comes to Tom and Violets rehearsal dinner to try to apologize. Tom rejects his apology and starts chasing Winton away, with Violet trying to catch up, but Winton gets away after Tom insists that he run or fight him. A drunken Tom then runs into Margaret, one of his Zingermans co-workers and has the chance to have sex with her, but opts out. He wakes up half-naked in the snow with a frostbitten toe, and he is taken to the hospital where the left big toe is amputated. Violet visits Tom at the hospital, before they call off their engagement once they arrive home.Tom moves back to San Francisco and becomes a sous-chef under Alex at the new restaurant, while also starting a relationship with the hostess Audrey (Dakota Johnson). However, Toms parents and Alex see that Tom is dissatisfied with his new life and motivate him to act upon this. Alex fires him, telling Tom that he is the better chef and should open his own franchise. Tom launches a specialty taco truck. Meanwhile, Violet starts a relationship with Winton and receives an assistant professorship at the university, but becomes upset when she learns she got the job because she was dating Winton rather than her abilities as a researcher and breaks up with Winton.When Violets last grandparent dies during the summer, Tom, having broken up with Audrey, shows up at the funeral in England and rekindles his relationship with Violet. They agree to spend the remainder of the summer together in San Francisco, and they begin to reconnect while sharing an apartment and working side-by-side in the taco truck. While driving Violet to the airport, Tom says he can take his food truck to where she is and continue their relationship. Violet then proposes to Tom, stating theyll always have problems together, but that it shouldnt stop them from getting married. Tom reveals the engagement ring he gave her initially, stating he was planning on proposing to her at the airport. They both agree and head to Alamo Square Park where Violet has organized for their family and friends to be waiting for an impromptu wedding. Violet allows Tom to choose between various options for the officiant, clothing and music, and they finally get married.",30000000,"[{""id"": 35, ""name"": ""Comedy""}]",http://www.thefiveyearengagementmovie.com/,72207,"[{""id"": 572, ""name"": ""sex""}, {""id"": 582, ""name"": ""san francisco""}, {""id"": 1946, ""name"": ""restaurant""}, {""id"": 3609, ""name"": ""frustration""}, {""id"": 3713, ""name"": ""chase""}, {""id"": 4891, ""name"": ""offer""}, {""id"": 6167, ""name"": ""engagement""}, {""id"": 9673, ""name"": ""love""}, {""id"": 11268, ""name"": ""psychologist""}, {""id"": 13027, ""name"": ""wedding""}, {""id"": 14983, ""name"": ""proposal""}, {""id"": 18293, ""name"": ""chef""}, {""id"": 160588, ""name"": ""ceremony""}, {""id"": 178863, ""name"": ""englishwoman""}, {""id"": 189093, ""name"": ""ring""}, {""id"": 198673, ""name"": ""unemployed""}]",en,"Exactly one year after Tom meets Violet, he surprises her with a wedding ring.

592,593,The Forest,2016,/wiki/The_Forest_(2016_film),"The majority of the story is set in and around the Aokigahara Forest, a forest at the northwest base of Mount Fuji in Japan known as a popular destination for suicide.Sara Price (Natalie Dormer), an American woman, receives a phone call from the Japanese police telling her that they think her troubled twin sister Jess Price (also Dormer) is dead, as she was seen going into Aokigahara forest. Despite the concerns of her fiancé, Rob, she journeys to Japan and arrives at the hotel where her sister was staying.At her hotel, Sara meets a reporter named Aiden. They drink together, and she tells him of her parents death. In reality, her father killed her mother, then committed suicide, but she tells him they were killed by a drunk driver. Her sister saw the bodies, but she didnt look. Aiden invites her to go into the forest with him and a park guide, Michi, so she can look for her sister.As the three enter Aokigahara, Michi tells Sara that Jess has most likely killed herself. Sara refuses to believe this, explaining how, being a twin, she can ""feel"" that Jess is still alive. Deep in the woods, the group discovers a yellow tent that Sara recognizes as Jesss. With nightfall approaching, Michi suggests they leave a note for Jess and leave. Sara refuses, and Aiden volunteers to stay with her through the night.That night, Sara hears rustling in the bushes and, believing it may be Jess, rushes into the woods after her. Sara finds a Japanese girl, Hoshiko, who claims to know Jess. The girl warns Sara not to trust Aiden and flees at the sound of his voice. Sara attempts to chase after her but falls and loses her.The next day, Aiden and Sara become lost and begin to walk around the forest. As they walk, Saras suspicions are raised and she demands Aiden to give her his phone and finds a picture of Jess on it. Aiden denies any involvement with Jess, but Sara runs into the forest alone. While running she begins to hear voices telling her to turn around. She appears to be unfazed by this until she hears the voice directly behind her. She turns around to see a hanging body and continues to run away. She then falls through a hole into a cave and, later she wakes up and discovers that she is in the cave with Hoshiko, who turns out to be a yūrei. Hoshiko then turns into what appears to be a ""demonic figure"". Sara then runs back towards the caves opening, where Aiden finds her and helps her out of the cave.  After some convincing, they continue to walk together. Rob arrives at the aokigahara forest with a search party and Michi, determined to find Sarah.Aiden brings Sara to an old ranger station he claims hed discovered while looking for her. Sara hears her sisters voice coming from a locked basement, and finds a note which implies that Aiden is holding Jess captive in the basement. Convinced that he is a threat, Sara attacks and kills Aiden with a small kitchen knife. As he dies, Sara realizes that Aiden was telling the truth and that the picture on his phone, the voice at the basement door and the note had all been hallucinations.In the basement of the ranger station, Sara sees a vision of the night her parents died. The ghost of her father suddenly appears and lunges toward her, grabbing her wrist. She cuts his fingers away from her wrist and escapes the station. Running into the forest, she sees Jess running toward the lights of the search party. Sara calls to her sister, who is unable to hear her. She realizes that her escape from the ranger station was another hallucination. When she cut at her fathers fingers she was actually cutting deep into her own wrists, and is now dying from blood loss in the basement. As she succumbs to her wounds, hands of a group of yūrei pull Sara into the forest floor. Her very much alive sister is rescued by the search party and explains that the ""feeling"" of her sister is gone and it is assumed that Jess knows Sara is dead.

593,594,The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,2011,/wiki/The_Girl_with_the_Dragon_Tattoo_(2011_film),"In Stockholm, Sweden, divorced journalist Mikael Blomkvist, co-owner of Millennium magazine, has lost a libel case brought against him by businessman Hans-Erik Wennerström. Lisbeth Salander, a brilliant but troubled investigator and hacker, compiles an extensive background check on Blomkvist for business magnate Henrik Vanger, who has a special task for him. In exchange for the promise of damning information about Wennerström, Blomkvist agrees to move to the Hedestad and investigate the disappearance and assumed murder of Henriks grandniece, Harriet, 40 years ago, to the disappointment of Blomkvists long-term lover and business partner Erika Berger, who wants him to stay in Stockholm. After moving to the Vanger familys estate, Blomkvist uncovers a notebook containing a list of names and numbers that no one has been able to decipher.Salander, who is under state legal guardianship due to diagnosed mental incompetence, is appointed a new guardian, lawyer Nils Bjurman in control of her finances, after her previous guardian Holger Palmgren, whom she had been close to, suffers a stroke. Bjurman, a sexual sadist, abuses his authority to extort sexual favors from Salander and, at one point, brutally rapes her, though he is unaware of a video camera recording the assault that Salander had placed on her bag. When Bjurman arrives for a meeting with Salander, she attacks him with a taser, incapacitating him. She then proceeds to exact retribution against Bjurman for his crimes by binding him to a bed, raping him with a metallic dildo, and tattooing a message on his stomach branding him as a rapist, all while forcing him to watch the video of her being assaulted. She tells him that he must relinquish control of her finances to her alone and petition the court to have her incompetency declaration voided, threatening that if he fails or refuses, she will post the video of him assaulting her online and ruin him.Blomkvists daughter Pernilla visits him and notes that the numbers from the notebook are Bible references. Blomkvist tells Vangers lawyer, Dirch Frode, that he needs help with his research, and Frode recommends Salander based on the work she did researching Blomkvist himself. Blomkvist hires Salander to investigate the notebooks content. She uncovers a connection to a series of murders of young women from 1947 through to 1967, with the women either being Jewish or having Biblical names; many of the Vangers are known antisemites. One morning, Blomkvist finds the mutilated corpse of a cat hed been tending to and one night while walking, he is shot at and narrowly escapes. While Salander tends to his injuries, they have sex and become lovers. Henriks openly national socialist brother Harald identifies Martin, Harriets brother and operational head of the Vanger empire, and Blomkvist marks Martin as a possible suspect. Salanders research uncovers evidence that Martin and his deceased father, Gottfried, committed the murders.Blomkvist breaks into Martins house to look for more clues, but Martin catches him and prepares to kill him. While torturing Blomkvist, Martin brags of having killed women for decades but denies killing Harriet. While Martin begins hanging Blomkvist with a rope tied to a mechanical lift, Salander arrives and strikes Martin in the face with a golf club, injuring him and saving Blomkvist. While Salander tends to Blomkvist, Martin flees. Salander, on her motorcycle, pursues Martin in his SUV. As the chase turns onto an icy road, the SUV runs off the road and flips upside down with Martin inside; as Salander approaches Martin with a pistol to shoot him, the car explodes and kills Martin. Salander nurses Blomkvist back to health and tells him that she tried to kill her father when she was 12 which led to her being under state care. Blomkvist deduces that Harriet is still alive and her cousin Anita probably knows where she is. They travel to London where Anita has been living since leaving Sweden and he and Salander monitor her, waiting for her to contact Harriet. When nothing happens, Blomkvist confronts her, deducing that the woman posing as Anita is Harriet herself. She explains that her father and brother had sexually abused her for years, and that Martin saw her kill their father in self-defense. Her cousin, Anita, smuggled her out of the island and let her live under her identity when she moved to London. Finally free of her brother Martin, she returns to Sweden and tearfully reunites with Henrik.As promised, Henrik gives Blomkvist the information on Wennerström, but it proves worthless. Salander hacks into Wennerströms computer and presents Blomkvist with evidence of Wennerströms crimes. Blomkvist publishes an article that ruins Wennerström, who immediately flees the country. Salander hacks into Wennerströms bank accounts and, travelling to Switzerland in disguise, transfers two billion euros to various accounts. Wennerström is murdered by an unknown person. Salander reveals to her former guardian Holger Palmgren that she has made a friend and is happy. On her way to give Blomkvist a Christmas present, Salander sees him together with Erika, though he had said he was going to see his daughter that evening.

594,595,The Giver,2014,/wiki/The_Giver_(film),"Following a calamity, referred to as The Ruin, society is reorganized into a series of communities, and all memories of the past are held by one person, the Receiver of Memory, for the purpose of shielding the rest of the community from its pain. Since the Receiver of Memory is the only individual in the community with the memories from earlier times, he must advise the Chief Elder and the other Elders on the decisions for the community. The Receiver of Memory and his protégé are the only ones able to see in color (eliminated so as to prevent envious feelings of other individuals). Jonas (Brenton Thwaites) is a 16-year-old boy who, like everyone else, is anxious about the career that he will be assigned. His best friends are Asher (Cameron Monaghan) and Fiona (Odeya Rush).On the day of graduation, everyone is assigned a career. Jonas is briefly skipped. He is not assigned a career until the end of the ceremony, when he is told that he will become the next Receiver of Memory and will progressively receive memories from his predecessor, the Giver (Jeff Bridges). Upon assuming his role, Jonas learns of the past of the Giver and his child, Rosemary (Taylor Swift), who had preceded Jonas as Receiver of Memory. She was so distraught from the memories that she committed suicide, which the Community calls ""release"". Its nature is regarded as mysterious, but Jonas learns that it is death by lethal injection. Jonas begins to teach his findings to Fiona and decides to share the idea of emotions. Fiona, who is unable to comprehend the idea of emotion, is unsure how she feels. Jonas then tells her to stop taking the injection and the next day, he kisses her, an antiquated action that is unknown to the community and which Jonas gained through memory.Jonas also shares his memories with the baby, Gabriel, who was brought home by his father, to their house. He develops a close relationship with him after discovering that he shares the same mark on his wrist Jonas does, the mark of a potential Receiver of Memory. Jonas decides that everyone should have the memories of the past and eventually, the Giver and Jonas decide that the only way to help the community is to go past the border of what they call ""Elsewhere"" and beyond the community. That would release the memories back into the community. Jonas sneaks out at curfew and decides to get Gabe at the Nurturing Center, who is to be ""released"" for his general weakness. Asher, his other longtime friend beside Fiona, tries to stop him before he leaves the neighborhood, but Jonas quickly punches him. Asher lies on the ground, stunned, and Jonas rides his bike to the Givers dwelling. Jonas tells the Giver, and the Giver, reluctant to let Jonas leave first, lets him leave after giving him memories of courage. He rushes to the Nurturing Center. He tells Fiona of his plan and wants to take her with him, but she refuses and instead helps him retrieve Gabe. Before he leaves, she kisses him then aids in his escape.Meanwhile, Jonas mother (Katie Holmes) and Asher go to the Chief Elder (Meryl Streep) to tell them Jonas is missing. Guards are sent to contain Jonas, who they say has become ""dangerous,"" but Jonas gets one of their motorcycles and drives off the cliff near the Givers dwelling into Elsewhere. Asher is assigned by the Chief Elder to use a drone to find Jonas and ""lose"" (kill) him, but when he finds Jonas stumbling through the desert, he instead captures Jonas with the drone. After Jonas implores Asher to think that if he ever cared for Jonas and would let him go, Asher sets him free by dropping him into a river. Jonas stumbles onto Elsewhere, and Fiona has been condemned to be ""released"" for helping him. Just as she is about to be ""released"" by Jonas father (Alexander Skarsgård), the Giver steps in and stalls the Chief Elder with memories of his daughter, Rosemary, trying to call out the Chief Elder but is unsuccessful.Eventually, Jonas finds a sled, like the one that he rode in a memory from the Giver, and makes his way beyond the border of Elsewhere, releasing memories and color vision back into the community, thus saving Fiona and Jonas father, who realizes what hes doing. Right then, Jonas mother sheds a single tear as she finally understands the feeling of love.

595,596,The Good Dinosaur,2015,/wiki/The_Good_Dinosaur,"In an alternate history, the asteroid that would have caused the extinction of the dinosaurs 65 million years ago passes safely over Earth.Sixty-five million years later, Apatosaurus farmers Henry and Ida have children Libby, Buck, and the runt Arlo, who has trouble adjusting to farm life. While his successful siblings are allowed to ""make their mark"" (a mud-print on the familys corn silo), Arlos timid nature makes tasks difficult for him. Henry attempts to give Arlo a sense of purpose by putting him in charge of guarding their silo, and helps him set a trap. It captures a feral caveboy, but Arlo doesnt have the heart to kill him, and sets him free. Disappointed, Henry takes Arlo to track the caveboy, leading them into a ravine. Henry saves Arlo from a flash flood before being swept away and killed.Without his father, Arlo shoulders more of the workload. He spots the same caveboy inside the silo and, blaming him for his fathers death, chases him until both fall into a river. Arlo cannot swim, and is swept downstream where he hits his head on a rock and is knocked unconscious. Awakening, he finds himself far from home and tries to survive on his own, but becomes trapped when a boulder pins his leg. The next day Arlo wakes to find his leg has been freed, and the caveboy appears with food for him. The caveboy then leads Arlo to a berry tree, where the caveboy fends off a large snake, amazing Arlo and impressing a nearby eccentric Styracosaurus who wants to keep the boy. He forces Arlo to compete with him to give the boy a name he will respond to, which Arlo finally wins when he calls him ""Spot"". Arlo and Spot bond as Arlo laments his lost family, and Spot reveals that his own parents are dead. Later, when a storm strikes, Arlo runs away in fear and loses the riverbank he has been following home.The next morning, Arlo wakes to find Spot at his side. They are noticed by a band of pterodactyls, led by Thunderclap, who appear to be conducting a rescue operation but turn out to be savagely carnivorous. When the pterodactyls try to take Spot, Arlo and Spot flee, happening upon a pair of Tyrannosaurus named Nash and Ramsey, who ward off the pterodactyls. Nash, Ramsey, and their father Butch have lost their herd of longhorns, so Arlo offers Spots help in sniffing them out. They locate the herd, but Butch recognizes the work of cattle rustlers, and uses Arlo as a lure. Arlo and Spot attract the attention of rustler Velociraptor, allowing Butch and his family to attack. During the fight, Arlo musters his courage and fends off two raptors who have overwhelmed Butch, helping to turn the fight in their favor. Having gained their respect, Arlo joins the Tyrannosaurus in driving the cattle south when he sees the familiar mountain peaks of his homeland in the distance, and leaves with Spot to return home. Along the way, they encounter an adult feral caveman in the distance, and though Spot shows interest, Arlo dissuades him and they continue on.As another storm approaches, Thunderclap and the pterodactyls return and attack and carry Spot away. Arlo becomes entangled in vines, where he has a vision of Henry leading him home. Arlo instead resolves to save Spot, making the vision of his father proud before it fades away. Arlo finds and attacks the pterodactyls, who have cornered Spot at the river. Arlo and Spot together plunge Thunderclap and the pterodactyls into the water, where they are swept helplessly downstream. When another flash flood occurs, Arlo leaps into the water to rescue Spot as the two are swept away toward a waterfall. Arlo protects Spot as the two plummet down the fall, and carries him to shore.As they approach Arlos home, the two again hear the unknown caveman call, and are approached by an entire cave family. With great reluctance, Arlo pushes Spot to join his adoptive family, and the two of them share a tearful goodbye.Arlo finally arrives home to his mother and siblings, and makes his mark on the silo between those of his mother and father.",175000000,"[{""id"": 12, ""name"": ""Adventure""}, {""id"": 16, ""name"": ""Animation""}, {""id"": 10751, ""name"": ""Family""}]",http://movies.disney.com/the-good-dinosaur,105864,"[{""id"": 1720, ""name"": ""tyrannosaurus rex""}, {""id"": 9713, ""name"": ""friends""}, {""id"": 12026, ""name"": ""alternate history""}, {""id"": 12616, ""name"": ""dinosaur""}, {""id"": 13073, ""name"": ""fear""}, {""id"": 14527, ""name"": ""storm""}, {""id"": 18330, ""name"": ""nature""}, {""id"": 187864, ""name"": ""human""}, {""id"": 189092, ""name"": ""journey""}]",en,An epic journey into the world of dinosaurs where an Apatosaurus named Arlo makes an unlikely human friend.,51.692953,"[{""name"": ""Walt Disney Pictures"", ""id"": 2}, {""name"": ""Pixar Animation Studios"", ""id"": 3}]","[{""iso_3166_1"": ""US"", ""name"": ""United States of America""}]",11/14/2015,331926147,93,"[{""iso_639_1"": ""en"", ""name"": ""English""}]",Released,Little Arms With Big Attitude,The Good Dinosaur,6.6,1736,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.05026108,0.44973892,0,0,0.149912973,1.89672084
596,597,The Green Hornet,2011,/wiki/The_Green_Hornet_(2011_film),"Britt Reid is the playboy son of James Reid, publisher of the Los Angeles Daily Sentinel. They have an estranged relationship until James is found dead from an allergic reaction to a bee sting 20 years later. After the funeral, Britt fires the staff aside from his maid, but later re-hires Kato, Jamess mechanic and a skilled martial artist.Britt and Kato get drunk together and, upon agreeing that they both hated James, visit the graveyard to cut the head off Jamess memorial statue. After they succeed, they rescue a nearby couple being mugged. When police mistake Britt and Kato themselves for criminals, Kato evades them in a car chase as he and Britt return to the mansion.Britt convinces Kato they should become crime-fighters posing as criminals. Kato develops a car outfitted with several gadgets and weapons, which they call the Black Beauty. Britt plans to capture Benjamin Chudnofsky, a Russian mobster uniting the crime families of Los Angeles under his command, and whom his father was trying to expose. To get Chudnofskys attention, Britt uses the Daily Sentinel as a vehicle to publish articles about a ""high-profile criminal"" he calls ""The Green Hornet.""Britt hires Lenore Case as his assistant and researcher, and uses her unwitting advice to raise the Green Hornets profile. Britt and Kato blow up several of Chudnofskys meth labs, leaving calling cards so Chudnofsky can contact them. Throughout all this, the Daily Sentinels managing editor, Mike Axford, fears this single-minded coverage will endanger Britts life, and District Attorney Frank Scanlon frets over public perception that he cannot stop the Green Hornet.Britt asks Lenore out, but she rebuffs him and instead invites Kato to dinner, making Britt jealous. Kato learns from her that mobsters often offer a peace summit to rivals in order to get close enough to kill them; Britt then tells Kato that Chudnofsky has offered them such a meeting. Kato tries dissuading him, but Britt, feeling overshadowed, follows his instincts. This nearly proves fatal when Chudnofsky tries to kill them.Barely escaping to the mansion, Britt and Kato argue and fight, and Britt fires both Kato and Lenore, who he believes are in a relationship. Kato receives an email from Chudnofsky on the Hornets calling-card email address, offering $1 million and half of Los Angeles to the ""Hornet"" if he kills Britt. Meanwhile, Britt discovers that Scanlon is corrupt, and that he tried to bribe James into downplaying the citys crime level to help his career. Chudnofsky, meanwhile, suffers a midlife crisis and reinvents himself as the supervillain ""Bloodnofsky"".Scanlon invites Britt to meet in a restaurant, where he reveals he murdered Britts father. Chudnofsky arrives with his men to kill Britt, but Kato saves Britt and they escape. At the Daily Sentinel, Britt intends to upload a recording of Scanlons confession onto the Web - which he belatedly discovers he did not manage to record. Chudnofsky and his men, who followed the duo there, engage them in a firefight, wounding Britt in the shoulder. Kato ultimately stabs Chudnofsky in the eyes with wood in self-defense and Britt guns him down. A SWAT team appears and fires at the Green Hornet and Kato, who use the remains of their nearly demolished Black Beauty to run Scanlon out the 10th-floor window, killing him. The Green Hornet and Kato flee to Lenores house, and she helps them hide from the police.The next morning, Britt promotes Axford to chief editor and stages being shot in the shoulder by Kato, further establishing the Green Hornet as a threat and allowing Britt to get treated by professionals in a hospital.

597,598,The Grey,2012,/wiki/The_Grey_(film),"John Ottway (Liam Neeson) works in Alaska as a marksman for an undisclosed oil company, killing grey wolves that threaten the drillers. On his last day on the job, he shoots one. That evening, Ottway writes a letter ""without purpose"" to his wife, Ana (Anne Openshaw), explaining his plans to commit suicide. He hears a distant wolf howl and doesnt follow through.The next day, Ottway and other oil drillers board a plane. During the flight, Ottway dreams of sleeping with his wife in bed but is awakened by a loud bang. He buckles up in fear of a possible plane crash. Shortly afterwards, the back of the plane is torn off and it crashes. Eight people including Ottway survive the crash. However, a young oil worker, Lewenden (James Badge Dale), dies of his injuries as Ottway sadly watches. Taking charge, Ottway sets the survivors on the task of building a fire. While doing this, he discovers a corpse, and is attacked by the grey wolf feeding on it. After saving Ottway, the group soon surmises that they are in the wolves territory. They decide to take turns keeping watch for the predators.Later, Hernandez (Ben Bray) is killed by two wolves. Ottway suggests they leave the crash site, but Diaz (Frank Grillo) questions his leadership. While searching for the wallets of their deceased colleagues, intending to return them to their families, Diaz finds an emergency wrist watch containing a radio beacon. The group then leaves the site.While walking, Flannery (Joe Anderson) falls behind, and is killed by wolves. One of them spots a pack of wolves approaching and the survivors run for the trees, lighting a fire in an attempt to ward off their attackers. The group sets about producing makeshift weaponry.  A stressed Diaz loses his cool somewhat and belligerently threatens Ottway with a knife, but is quickly disarmed and begins regretting his actions. As hes about to apologize, hes suddenly pounced upon by a wolf from behind. An omega wolf sent by the alpha wolf to test them, Ottway later surmises, after the survivors manage to kill it and then roast it for food. A bloodied and crazed Diaz, elated at having survived the attack, beheads the corpse and loudly howls like a wolf, then defiantly throws the severed head back at the pack. A move noted by the group as possibly unwise, as they accept a statement that ""wolves are known to take revenge"".While sitting around the fire, Diaz tells the group of his atheism and Talget (Dermot Mulroney) states he believes in God and lovingly talks about his daughter. Ottway states he is also an atheist, but wishes he could believe or have faith; he then recites a simple poem written by his father. A blizzard approaches; some survivors set to maintaining the fire while the others get some rest.The following morning, Burke (Nonso Anozie), who had earlier been suffering from hypoxia, is found dead. The remaining survivors leave the camp and travel to the edge of a steep canyon. Hendrick (Dallas Roberts) secures a line across to a tall tree opposite and Diaz & Ottway traverse the canyon. Talget, however, is afraid of heights and with the added handicap of a bleeding mangled hand, when his foot becomes caught on a hook, in the ensuing struggle the rope breaks away. He falls to the ground, getting severely thrashed by tree branches on the way down; barely alive, he hallucinates a vision of his daughter, but is instantly set upon and dragged away by four wolves. While attempting to save Talget, Diaz falls from the tree and badly injures his knee.Diaz, Ottway, and Hendrick continue and arrive at a river. There, Diaz, humbled by his journey and unable to walk on, explains that he can accept dying in the middle of nature and will not try to keep running. They part company, leaving a tearful Diaz contemplating the glorious mountainous vista, resigned to his fate. Reluctantly Ottway and Hendrick continue on together. Further along the river, Ottway and Hendrick are set upon by the wolves. In an attempt to flee, Hendrick falls into the river and in the chaos is trapped beneath the surface when his foot gets wedged between boulders. Ottway attempts to save him but unable to pull him loose, Hendrick soon drowns. Frustrated and now alone, Ottway looks up and angrily appeals to God for help, to ""show him something real"", but seeing nothing, he decides he will “do this on my own.”Ottway, cold and wet, continues on alone.  Exhausted, he stops walking and begins going through the collected wallets of the others. Ottway then realizes he has stumbled right into the wolves den - and that the team had been steadily walking towards, not away from, the source of danger. Surrounded by the pack and having the leader of the pack standing in front of him, he looks at his wifes photo in his wallet; it is then revealed that she was dying of a terminal illness (hence his own futility earlier) and that he was trying to kill himself earlier in the film but unable to do so. As the large, snarling alpha wolf approaches him, Ottway arms himself with a knife and shards of glass from small liquor bottles taped to his other hand. He recites the words ""Once more into the fray. Into the last good fight Ill ever know. Live and die on this day. Live and die on this day.""In a brief post-credits scene, the alpha wolf lies on the ground, breathing slowly and deeply.

598,599,The Hangover,2011,/wiki/The_Hangover_(film),"To celebrate his upcoming marriage to Tracy Garner, Doug Billings travels to Las Vegas with his best friends Phil Wenneck, Stuart ""Stu"" Price, and Tracys brother Alan, in Dougs future father-in-law Sids vintage Mercedes-Benz W111. They spend the night at Caesars Palace, where they relax in their hotel suite before celebrating with a few drinks on the hotel rooftop. The next morning, Phil, Stu, and Alan awaken to find they have no memory of the previous night. Doug is nowhere to be found, Stus tooth is in Alans pocket, their suite is in a state of complete disarray, a tiger is in their bathroom, a chicken is in their living room, and a baby is in the closet, whom Alan names ""Carlos"". They see Dougs mattress impaled on a statue outside of Caesars Palace and when they ask for their Mercedes, the valet delivers an LVPD police cruiser.Using clues to retrace their steps, the trio travel to a hospital where they discover they were drugged with Rohypnol (""roofies""), causing their memory loss, and that they came to the hospital from a chapel. At the chapel, they learn that Stu married a stripper named Jade, despite being in a long-term relationship with his abusive, domineering and unfaithful girlfriend Melissa. Outside the chapel, the trio is attacked by gangsters saying they are looking for someone. They flee and visit Jade, discovering that she is the mother of the baby, whose real name is Tyler. They are then arrested by the police for stealing the police cruiser. After being told that the Mercedes has been impounded, the trio is released when they unknowingly volunteer to be targets for a taser demonstration. While driving the Mercedes, they discover a naked Chinese man named Leslie Chow in the trunk. Chow jumps out of the trunk, beats the trio up with a crowbar and flees. Alan confesses that he drugged their drinks to ensure they had a good night, believing the drug to be ecstasy.Returning to their suite, they find the boxer Mike Tyson, who orders the trio to return the tiger to his mansion immediately. Stu drugs the tiger with the remaining Rohypnol, and they drive towards Tysons home in the Mercedes-Benz. However, the tiger awakens midway and attacks them, clawing Phil on the neck and damaging the cars interior. After pushing the car the rest of the way to the mansion, Tyson shows the trio footage of them at his house to help them locate Doug. While driving, their car is intentionally t-boned by a 2009 Cadillac Escalade. The passengers are revealed to be the gangsters from the chapel, and their boss Chow. Chow accuses the trio of kidnapping him and stealing $80,000 that was in his purse. As the trio denies this, Chow tells them he has Doug, and threatens to kill him if his money is not returned. Unable to find Chows $80,000, Alan, with help from Stu and Jade, uses his knowledge of card counting to win $82,400 playing Blackjack.The next morning, they meet with Chow in the desert and exchange the money, only to find that ""Doug"" is the black drug dealer who accidentally sold Alan Rohypnol. With the wedding set to occur in 5 hours, Phil calls Tracy and tells her that they cannot find Doug. When ""Black Doug"" mentions that, ""If you take Roofies, youre more likely to end up on the floor than on the roof,"" Stu realizes where Doug is. The trio travels back to their hotel where they find a badly sunburned Doug on the roof. Stu, Phil, and Alan had moved him there on his mattress the night before as a practical joke, but forgot where they left him. Doug had thrown his own mattress onto the statue, in an attempt to signal help. Before leaving, Stu makes arrangements to go on a date with Jade the following week. Jade also reveals Stu had pulled out his own tooth after Alan dared him to. With less than four hours before the wedding and with no flights to L.A. available, the four quickly drive home. Along the way, Doug reveals he has possession of Chows original $80,000. Despite their late arrival, Doug and Tracy are married, the former learns the damaged Mercedes was a wedding gift, and Stu angrily breaks up with Melissa, having grown tired of her domineering and abusive attitude. As the reception ends, Alan finds Stus digital camera containing photos of the events they cant remember, and the four agree to look at the pictures together before deleting the evidence of their exploits.

599,600,The Hangover Part II,2013,/wiki/The_Hangover_Part_II,"Two years after the events of the first movie in Las Vegas, Stu Price, Phil Wenneck, Alan Garner and Doug Billings travel to Thailand to celebrate Stus upcoming wedding to Lauren. Much to Alans dismay, they are joined by Laurens younger brother, Teddy. At the rehearsal dinner, Laurens father reveals his disapproval of Stu during a toast. Later that night, Stu hesitantly joins Phil, Doug, Alan and Teddy for a beer. Sitting at a campfire and roasting marshmallows, the group toast to Stu and Laurens future happiness.The next morning, Phil, Stu and Alan, along with gangster Leslie Chow—whom Alan befriended after Las Vegas—and a chain-smoking capuchin monkey, awaken in a dirty hotel room in Bangkok. Stu has a face tattoo (a replica of Mike Tysons) and Alans head is completely shaved. They cannot find Teddy, and discover only his severed finger. Chow begins to relay the events of the prior night, but he seemingly dies after snorting a line of cocaine. Panicked, the trio dispose of Chows body in an ice box.Through a tip from Doug who is still at the resort (he left the campfire earlier than the others), they go to a police station to pick up Teddy but are given a wheelchair-bound elderly Buddhist monk, who knows more about what happened; however, he refuses to reveal anything, having taken a vow of silence. After finding a business card, they travel to the smoldering ruins of the business. They enter a nearby tattoo parlor where Stu got his tattoo, and they learn that they started a fight that escalated into a riot. The trio returns the monk to his Buddhist temple, where they are encouraged by the head monk to meditate. Alan is able to recall that they had been at the White Lion strip club, where they learn that Stu was sodomized by a kathoey stripper named Kimmy. Upon exiting, the trio are attacked by two Russian mobsters who steal the monkey, and one shoots Phil in his arm.After Phil is treated at a clinic, Alan confesses that he had drugged some of the marshmallows from the previous night with muscle relaxers and ADHD medication in order to sedate Teddy, as he feared the others were going to replace him with Teddy, but accidentally mixed up the bags. Phil and Stu become furious that Alan drugged them again. Stu blames Alan for ruining his life and attacks him. Phil breaks it up and tells them that they have to stick together. They notice something on Alans stomach: an address and a time for a meeting. They meet a gangster named Kingsley, who demands Chows bank account password by the next morning in exchange for Teddy. They return to the hotel to try to find Chows password, only to discover that he is still alive. They steal the monkey (who had the code given to him and put inside his jacket for safe-keeping by Chow) back from the Russian mobsters through a violent car chase, during which the monkey is shot and injured. After taking the code and leaving the monkey at a veterinary clinic, the group completes the deal with Kingsley. Suddenly, Interpol agents appear and arrest Chow. Kingsley turns out to be an undercover agent, who tells the trio that the police had used the information that Teddy had disappeared to arrest Chow and Kingsley actually does not know where Teddy is.Desperate and out of clues, Phil calls Dougs wife Tracy to tell her they cannot find Teddy. Stu decides to call off the wedding and live in Bangkok and say that Teddy died. While Alan is playing a game of Pac-Man the power goes out again. Stu suddenly realizes where Teddy is. The trio rushes back to the hotel to find Teddy who is in the elevator unharmed (albeit still missing a finger). Teddy had woken up in the middle of the night to get more ice for his severed finger (after the first bucket of ice had melted) but became trapped after the power went out. The four use Chows speedboat, the Perfect Life, the keys for which were in Teddys pocket, to travel back to the wedding reception.Arriving on land just as Laurens father is about to cancel the wedding, Stu makes a defiant speech where he rejects being boring and instead states that he is in fact quite wild. Impressed, Laurens father gives the couple his blessing. After they exchange their vows, Alan presents Stu with a special gift at the post-reception dance: a musical guest performance by Mike Tyson. Teddy later discovers that he had taken many pictures during the night on his cell phone. The group, along with Tyson, agree to look at the pictures together once (some of which reveal Teddy lost his finger playing the knife game) before erasing the evidence of their exploits once again.",80000000,"[{""id"": 35, ""name"": ""Comedy""}]",http://hangoverpart2.warnerbros.com/,45243,"[{""id"": 1381, ""name"": ""sun glasses""}, {""id"": 6710, ""name"": ""interpol""}, {""id"": 11199, ""name"": ""undercover cop""}, {""id"": 11461, ""name"": ""hangover""}, {""id"": 179431, ""name"": ""duringcreditsstinger""}]",en,"The Hangover crew heads to Thailand for Stu's wedding.

600,601,The Help,2011,/wiki/The_Help_(film),"In 1963, Aibileen Clark is an African-American maid in Jackson, Mississippi, and in intermittent voice overs she tells her ""career"" story to the aspiring writer Eugenia ""Skeeter"" Phelan, a recent graduate of Ole Miss and a friend of Aibileens employer and fellow socialite Elizabeth Leefolt. Aibileen cares for the Leefolts daughter, Mae Mobley, whom Elizabeth neglects. Aibileens best friend is the plain-spoken Minny Jackson, who works for Mrs. Walters, the mother of Hilly Holbrook, the leader of the womens socialite group.Skeeter is uncomfortable with the racist attitudes of her socialite friends towards their maids. She is shocked when Hilly forwards a letter to the Home Sanitation Initiative to install separate bathrooms for the help. Skeeter later learns that her mother Charlotte fired her childhood maid Constantine for unknown reasons.During a terrible storm, Minny refuses to go out to use the helps toilet and uses the guests bathroom, resulting in her getting fired by Hilly, who then slanders her name with claims of theft, rendering her essentially unemployable.Minny eventually finds a job with Celia, wife of Johnny Foote, Hillys former beau. The two become friends through Minnys cooking lessons, though they keep Minnys employment secret from Johnny. Celia suffers a miscarriage and reveals to Minny that she has suffered three previous miscarriages. Minny comes upon Skeeters visiting Aibileen and joins in the book project effort. Skeeter is advised by her book editor at Harper & Row, Elaine Stein, that the stories of two maids are not enough, but potential retribution from the maids employers hinders others from joining the project. Aibileen tells Skeeter about the pain she experiences about her son being fatally crushed while on the job. Aibileen has struggled to find closure from his death, and believes that helping with the book will enable her to find that closure.Hilly refuses to lend more money to her replacement maid, Yule May, who is struggling to send her twin sons to college. One day, she discovers a discarded ring and pawns it. However, Yule May is brutally arrested after Hilly reports the theft. Following this and the assassination of Medgar Evers, more maids come forward with their stories, believing the book would help put an end to the brutality against African-Americans.Following the assassination of John F. Kennedy, Skeeter, Aibileen, and Minny fear that the maids stories will be recognized. Minny then reveals the ""terrible awful"" that she did to Hilly: following her termination, Minny baked her renowned chocolate pie and gave it to Hilly. Minny, however, prevented Mrs. Walters from having a slice, and revealed that she baked her own excrement into the pie. Its inclusion in the book would prompt Hilly to crusade in denial that the book is about Jackson.Skeeter confronts her mother Charlotte about Constantines termination. Charlotte reveals that during a lunch with the local chapter of the Daughters of America, Constantines daughter Rachel arrived. Rachel disobeyed Charlottes orders of entering through the kitchen and embarrassed her. In order to save face, Charlotte fired Constantine and ordered them both to leave. Shortly afterward, Rachel took Constantine to Chicago, where she later died. Charlotte had every intention to bring Constantine back to Jackson.The book is published anonymously, and it is a success. Minny reveals the ""terrible awful"" to Celia, who finally sees Hilly as the manipulative bully that she is. Celia lets on that she knows about the ""terrible awful"" by writing a check to one of Hillys charity groups made out to ""Two Slice Hilly"". Incensed, Hilly confronts and attempts to intimidate Skeeter through threat of legal proceedings, but she reminds Hilly that ""that"" is in chapter 12. Charlotte then intervenes, lets on that she knows about the ""terrible awful"" and orders Hilly off the property. Charlotte and Skeeter reconcile when Charlotte tells her how proud she is about her courage, the book and the job offer in New York City.Johnny approaches Minny and reveals that he knew that shed been working at his house, how appreciative he is about her friendship with Celia, how it saved her life, and that she has permanent job security. This act of kindness gives Minny the courage to take her children away from her abusive husband and never look back.In an attempt to seek revenge for helping Skeeter, Hilly pressures Elizabeth to terminate Aibileen, with Hilly present and trying to frame Aibileen for theft. But Aibileen stands up to Hilly, calling her a godless woman, never satisfied until she gets what she wants. Elizabeth orders Aibileen to leave. Aibileen bids farewell to Elizabeths daughter and pleads with Elizabeth to give her daughter a chance, as Elizabeth begins to cry. Aibileen reflects on the ordeal and finds closure.

601,602,The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey,2015,/wiki/The_Hobbit:_An_Unexpected_Journey,"Approaching his 111th birthday, the Hobbit Bilbo Baggins begins writing down the full story of his adventure 60 years earlier for the benefit of his nephew Frodo. Long before Bilbos involvement, the Dwarf king Thrór brought an era of prosperity for his kin under the Lonely Mountain until the arrival of the dragon Smaug. Destroying the nearby town of Dale, Smaug drove the Dwarves out of their mountain and took their hoard of gold. Thrórs grandson, Thorin, sees King Thranduil and his Wood-elves on a nearby hillside, and is dismayed when they leave rather than aid his people, resulting in Thorins everlasting hatred of Elves.In the Shire, 50-year-old Bilbo is tricked by the wizard Gandalf the Grey into hosting a party for Thorin and his company of Dwarves: Balin, Dwalin, Fíli, Kíli, Dori, Nori, Ori, Óin, Glóin, Bifur, Bofur, and Bombur. Gandalfs aim is to recruit Bilbo as the companys ""burglar"" to aid them in their quest to enter the Lonely Mountain. Bilbo is unwilling to accept at first, but has a change of heart after the company leaves without him the next day. Travelling onward, the company is captured by three Trolls. Bilbo stalls the Trolls from eating them until dawn, and Gandalf exposes the trolls to sunlight, turning them to stone. The company locates the Trolls cave and finds treasure and Elven blades. Thorin and Gandalf each take an Elf-made blade, Orcrist and Glamdring, respectively; Gandalf also finds an Elven shortsword, which he gives to Bilbo.The wizard Radagast the Brown finds Gandalf and the company, and recounts an encounter at Dol Guldur with the Necromancer, a sorcerer who has been corrupting Greenwood with dark magic. Chased by Orcs, Gandalf leads the company through a hidden passage to Rivendell. There, Lord Elrond discloses a hidden indication of a secret door on the companys map of the Lonely Mountain, which will be visible only on Durins Day. Gandalf later approaches the White Council — consisting of Elrond, Galadriel and Saruman the White — and presents a Morgul blade, a weapon of the Witch-king of Angmar, which Radagast obtained from Dol Guldur as a sign that the Necromancer is linked to an eventual return of Sauron. While Saruman presses concern to the more present matter of the Dwarves quest, requesting that Gandalf put an end to it, Gandalf secretly reveals to Galadriel he had anticipated this and had the Dwarves move forward without him.The company journeys into the Misty Mountains, where they find themselves amid a colossal battle between Stone Giants. They take refuge in a cave and are captured by Goblins, who take them to their leader, the Great Goblin. Bilbo becomes separated from the Dwarves and falls into a crevice where he encounters Gollum, who unknowingly drops a golden ring. Pocketing the ring, Bilbo finds himself confronted by Gollum. They play a riddle game, wagering that Bilbo will be shown the way out if he wins or eaten by Gollum if he loses. Bilbo eventually wins by asking Gollum what he has in his pocket. Noticing his ring is lost, Gollum realizes that Bilbo possesses it and chases him. Bilbo discovers that the ring grants him invisibility, but when he has a chance to kill Gollum, Bilbo spares his life out of pity and escapes while Gollum shouts his hatred towards the hobbit Baggins.Meanwhile, the Great Goblin reveals to the Dwarves that Azog, an Orc war-chief who killed Thrór and lost his forearm to Thorin in battle outside the Dwarven kingdom of Moria, has placed a bounty on Thorins head. Gandalf arrives and leads the Dwarves in an escape, killing the Great Goblin. Bilbo exits the mountain and rejoins the company, keeping his newly obtained ring secret. The company is ambushed by Azog and his hunting party, and takes refuge in trees. Thorin charges at Azog, who overpowers and severely injures him with his Warg. Bilbo saves Thorin from the Orcs just as the company is rescued by eagles. They escape to the safety of the Carrock where Gandalf revives Thorin, who renounces his previous disdain for Bilbo after being saved by him.

603,604,The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug,2013,/wiki/The_Hobbit:_The_Desolation_of_Smaug,"Thorin and his company are being pursued by Azog and his Orc party following the events of the previous film.  They are ushered along by Gandalf to the nearby home of Beorn, a skin-changer who can take the form of the bear. That night, Azog is summoned to Dol Guldur by the Necromancer, who commands him to marshal his forces for war, so Azog delegates the hunt for Thorin to his son Bolg. The following day, Beorn escorts the company to the borders of Mirkwood, where Gandalf discovers Black Speech imprinted on an old ruin. Heeding a promise he made to Galadriel, he warns the company to remain on the path and leaves to investigate the tombs of the Nazgûl. Upon entering the forest, the dwarves lose their way and are ensnared by giant spiders. Bilbo sets about freeing them with the help of his recently acquired invisibility ring. He subsequently drops the ring and first begins to understand its dark influence after he brutally kills a creature to retrieve it.The remaining spiders are fended off by the Wood-elves led by Tauriel and Legolas. They also capture the Dwarves and bring Thorin before their king Thranduil. Thorin confronts Thranduil about his neglect of the Dwarves of Erebor following Smaugs attack 60 years earlier, and is consequently imprisoned with the other Dwarves. Bilbo, having avoided capture, arranges an escape using empty wine barrels that are sent downstream. While being pursued by the Wood-elves, they are ambushed by Bolg and his Orc party, and Kíli is wounded with a Morgul shaft. They engage in a running three-way battle down the river, but ultimately the Dwarves are able to escape both groups of pursuers. Thranduil then seals off his kingdom when an Orc captive reveals an evil entity has returned and is amassing an army in the south, but Tauriel decides to leave and assist the Dwarves, and Legolas goes after her. Meanwhile, Gandalf and Radagast go to investigate the tombs of the Nazgûl, which they find to be empty.The company are smuggled into Esgaroth by a bargeman called Bard, but are discovered raiding the town armory for new weapons. Thorin promises the Master and the people of Laketown a share of the mountains treasure, and it is revealed that Bard is a descendant of the last ruler of Dale, and possesses the last black arrow capable of killing Smaug. Kíli is forced to remain behind, tended to by Fíli, Óin, and Bofur, as the remaining company receive a grand farewell. Meanwhile, Gandalf travels south to the ruins of Dol Guldur, while Radagast leaves to warn Galadriel of their discovery at the tombs of the Nazgûl. Gandalf finds the ruins infested with Orcs and is ambushed by Azog. The Necromancer overpowers Gandalf and reveals himself as Sauron.Thorin and his remaining company reach the Lonely Mountain, where Bilbo discovers the hidden entrance. He is sent in to retrieve the Arkenstone, and while doing so, he accidentally awakens Smaug. While trying to find Bilbo, Smaug reveals his knowledge of Saurons return. Back in Laketown, Bard attempts to bring the black arrow to the towns launcher, as he fears what may happen when the Dwarves enter the mountain. However, he is arrested in the process and leaves his son to hide the arrow. Bolg and his Orc party infiltrate the town and attack the four Dwarves, but are quickly dispatched by Tauriel and Legolas. Tauriel then tends to Kíli, while Legolas leaves in pursuit of Bolg. Meanwhile, Gandalf watches helplessly as Azog and an Orc army march from Dol Guldur towards the Lonely Mountain.Back inside the mountain, during a long chase, Bilbo and the Dwarves rekindle the mountains forge using Smaugs flames to create and melt a large golden statue of Thrór, hoping to bury Smaug alive in the molten gold.

604,605,The Hunger Games,2016,/wiki/The_Hunger_Games_(film),"As punishment for a past rebellion, the 12 districts of the nation of Panem are forced by the Capitol to select two tributes, one boy and one girl between  12 and 18, to fight to the death in the annual Hunger Games until there is only one survivor. In District 12, after her younger sister Primrose is chosen, Katniss Everdeen volunteers to take her place. She and fellow tribute Peeta Mellark are escorted to the Capitol by chaperone Effie Trinket and mentor Haymitch Abernathy, a past victor. Haymitch stresses the importance of gaining sponsors, as they can provide gifts during the Games. While training, Katniss observes the ""Careers"" (Marvel, Glimmer, Cato and Clove), volunteers from Districts 1 and 2 who have trained for the Games from an early age. During a televised interview with Caesar Flickerman, Peeta expresses his love for Katniss, which she initially sees as an attempt to attract sponsors; she later learns his admission is genuine.At the start of the Games, Katniss ignores Haymitchs advice and grabs some of the supplies placed around the Cornucopia, a structure at the starting point, and narrowly escapes death. Twelve tributes die in the initial melee, and only eleven, including the Careers, survive the first day. Katniss tries to stay away from the others, but Head Gamemaker Seneca Crane triggers a forest fire to drive her towards them. She runs into the Careers, with whom Peeta has seemingly allied, and flees up a tree. Peeta advises the Careers to wait her out. The next morning, Katniss notices Rue, District 11s young female tribute, hiding in an adjacent tree. Rue draws her attention to a nest of tracker jackers, genetically modified venomous wasps. Using a serrated knife, Katniss saws the branch holding the nest off of the tree, causing it to fall on the Careers; Glimmer succumbs to the stings and dies, while the others escape to a nearby lake.

Katniss destroys the supplies the Careers have stockpiled by detonating the mines guarding them, while Rue provides a distraction. Katniss finds and frees Rue from a net, but Marvel impales Rue with a spear thrown at Katniss, who she fatally shoots with an arrow in response.

608,609,The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,2013,/wiki/The_Hunger_Games:_Catching_Fire,"After the 74th Hunger Games, Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark return to District 12, where President Snow visits Katniss. Snow explains that her actions in the Games have inspired uprisings. He orders her to use the upcoming Victory Tour to convince people that her actions were out of love for Peeta and not defiance against the Capitol, or District 12 will be destroyed, ""just like District 13"". He makes Katniss promise that the two will not lie to each other.As the tour begins, Haymitch Abernathy warns Katniss and Peeta that the ""show"" of their relationship must continue for the rest of their lives. Katniss suggests they announce their engagement, which is approved by Snow, with their wedding to be staged at his mansion in the Capitol.Katniss warns Gale Hawthorne of Snows threat to kill both their families. Peacekeepers crack down on District 12, and Gale is publicly whipped after attacking new Head Peacekeeper Romulus Thread. Snow announces that the third Quarter Quell of the upcoming Hunger Games will involve tributes selected from previous victors. Katniss immediately devotes herself to ensuring Peetas survival, and makes Haymitch promise to help. At the reaping, Effie Trinket draws Katnisss and Haymitchs names, but Peeta immediately volunteers to take Haymitchs place.Haymitch reveals that the tributes are angry about being returned to the Games, and all of them will most likely attempt to stop the games. For her pre-Games interview, Katniss wears a wedding dress, as ordered by Snow, but her stylist Cinna rigs it to transform into a representation of a mockingjay. Peeta announces on-air that he and Katniss secretly married and are expecting a baby. The audience of Capitol citizens shouts for the Games to be stopped, to no avail. Just before Katniss enters the arena, Cinna is severely beaten and dragged away by Peacekeepers, as Katniss watches helplessly.In the Games, Katniss allies with Finnick Odair and the elderly Mags, his mentor. When the arenas force field shocks Peeta, stopping his heart, Finnick revives him. The group flees from a poisonous fog, with Finnick carrying Mags, but when Peeta cannot go on, Mags sacrifices herself so that Finnick can help him. When mandrills attack, Peeta is saved by the unexpected sacrifice of a hiding tribute, the female from District 6. The group escapes to the beach around the central lake, where Finnick greets District 3s Wiress and Beetee and District 7s Johanna Mason. Wiress repeats the phrase ""tick-tock"", leading Katniss to realize that the arena is designed like a clock, with unchanging hazards each hour contained within their respective zones on the clock. As the team waits for the next danger, Wiress is stabbed to death by Gloss, who alongside his sister Cashmere, and District 2 tributes Brutus and Enobaria, comprise the Careers. Gloss is immediately fatally shot by Katniss while Johanna kills Cashmere with her axe. Finnick is injured by Enobarias knife, and after the Gamemakers spin the clock to disorient the tributes, they quickly leave the beach for the woods.Beetee suggests luring the Careers to the wet beach and electrocuting them by running his wire to the lake from a tree that is struck by lightning every 12 hours, having won his games by doing so, killing six tributes at once. The group separates to prepare the trap, Finnick and Peeta protecting Beetee, and Katniss running the wire down to the beach with Johanna. While pulling the coil, an unknown source of tension makes it apparent another tribute is on their tail. When Brutus and Enobaria emerge, Johanna knocks Katniss to the ground, cuts the tracker out of her arm, and flees. Katniss returns to the tree and finds an unconscious Beetee. Unable to recover Peeta, and hearing a cannon (which was Peeta killing Brutus), Katniss almost kills Finnick, thinking he broke the alliance and attacked Peeta, but he reminds her to remember who ""the real enemy"" is, as Haymitch had advised her before the games. Katniss attaches the wire to an arrow and shoots it into the arenas roof just as the lightning hits. The lightning strike paralyzes Katniss and incapacitates Finnick, causing a power failure that brings down the dome and disables the security cameras inside the arena, preventing the Capitol from observing the events.Katniss awakens in a hovercraft with Beetee, who is still unconscious. In another room she finds Haymitch, Finnick, and Plutarch Heavensbee, the head Gamemaker, who is revealed to be a rebel against Snow. He tells her they are bound for District 13, headquarters of the rebellion, and that half the tributes (the ones from 3, 4, 6, 7, 8 and 11) were recruited to help Katniss escape, as she is the symbol of the growing rebellion.

609,610,The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,2014,/wiki/The_Hunger_Games:_Catching_Fire,"After the 74th Hunger Games, Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark return to District 12, where President Snow visits Katniss. Snow explains that her actions in the Games have inspired uprisings. He orders her to use the upcoming Victory Tour to convince people that her actions were out of love for Peeta and not defiance against the Capitol, or District 12 will be destroyed, ""just like District 13"". He makes Katniss promise that the two will not lie to each other.As the tour begins, Haymitch Abernathy warns Katniss and Peeta that the ""show"" of their relationship must continue for the rest of their lives. Katniss suggests they announce their engagement, which is approved by Snow, with their wedding to be staged at his mansion in the Capitol.Katniss warns Gale Hawthorne of Snows threat to kill both their families. Peacekeepers crack down on District 12, and Gale is publicly whipped after attacking new Head Peacekeeper Romulus Thread. Snow announces that the third Quarter Quell of the upcoming Hunger Games will involve tributes selected from previous victors. Katniss immediately devotes herself to ensuring Peetas survival, and makes Haymitch promise to help. At the reaping, Effie Trinket draws Katnisss and Haymitchs names, but Peeta immediately volunteers to take Haymitchs place.Haymitch reveals that the tributes are angry about being returned to the Games, and all of them will most likely attempt to stop the games. For her pre-Games interview, Katniss wears a wedding dress, as ordered by Snow, but her stylist Cinna rigs it to transform into a representation of a mockingjay. Peeta announces on-air that he and Katniss secretly married and are expecting a baby. The audience of Capitol citizens shouts for the Games to be stopped, to no avail. Just before Katniss enters the arena, Cinna is severely beaten and dragged away by Peacekeepers, as Katniss watches helplessly.In the Games, Katniss allies with Finnick Odair and the elderly Mags, his mentor. When the arenas force field shocks Peeta, stopping his heart, Finnick revives him. The group flees from a poisonous fog, with Finnick carrying Mags, but when Peeta cannot go on, Mags sacrifices herself so that Finnick can help him. When mandrills attack, Peeta is saved by the unexpected sacrifice of a hiding tribute, the female from District 6. The group escapes to the beach around the central lake, where Finnick greets District 3s Wiress and Beetee and District 7s Johanna Mason. Wiress repeats the phrase ""tick-tock"", leading Katniss to realize that the arena is designed like a clock, with unchanging hazards each hour contained within their respective zones on the clock. As the team waits for the next danger, Wiress is stabbed to death by Gloss, who alongside his sister Cashmere, and District 2 tributes Brutus and Enobaria, comprise the Careers. Gloss is immediately fatally shot by Katniss while Johanna kills Cashmere with her axe. Finnick is injured by Enobarias knife, and after the Gamemakers spin the clock to disorient the tributes, they quickly leave the beach for the woods.Beetee suggests luring the Careers to the wet beach and electrocuting them by running his wire to the lake from a tree that is struck by lightning every 12 hours, having won his games by doing so, killing six tributes at once. The group separates to prepare the trap, Finnick and Peeta protecting Beetee, and Katniss running the wire down to the beach with Johanna. While pulling the coil, an unknown source of tension makes it apparent another tribute is on their tail. When Brutus and Enobaria emerge, Johanna knocks Katniss to the ground, cuts the tracker out of her arm, and flees. Katniss returns to the tree and finds an unconscious Beetee. Unable to recover Peeta, and hearing a cannon (which was Peeta killing Brutus), Katniss almost kills Finnick, thinking he broke the alliance and attacked Peeta, but he reminds her to remember who ""the real enemy"" is, as Haymitch had advised her before the games. Katniss attaches the wire to an arrow and shoots it into the arenas roof just as the lightning hits. The lightning strike paralyzes Katniss and incapacitates Finnick, causing a power failure that brings down the dome and disables the security cameras inside the arena, preventing the Capitol from observing the events.Katniss awakens in a hovercraft with Beetee, who is still unconscious. In another room she finds Haymitch, Finnick, and Plutarch Heavensbee, the head Gamemaker, who is revealed to be a rebel against Snow. He tells her they are bound for District 13, headquarters of the rebellion, and that half the tributes (the ones from 3, 4, 6, 7, 8 and 11) were recruited to help Katniss escape, as she is the symbol of the growing rebellion. They were unable to rescue Peeta and Johanna, and they are captives in the Capitol. Katniss is sedated after attacking Haymitch for not keeping his promise to protect Peeta. She later awakens to find Gale by her side. He assures her that her family is safe, but District 12 has been destroyed by the Capitol after Snow was made aware of the rebels plot.",130000000,"[{""id"": 12, ""name"": ""Adventure""}, {""id"": 28, ""name"": ""Action""}, {""id"": 878, ""name"": ""Science Fiction""}]",http://www.thehungergames.movie/,101299,"[{""id"": 271, ""name"": ""competition""}, {""id"": 818, ""name"": ""based on novel""}, {""id"": 1310, ""name"": ""mentor""}, {""id"": 1328, ""name"": ""secret""}, {""id"": 1382, ""name"": ""factory""}, {""id"": 2136, ""name"": ""television""}, {""id"": 2903, ""name"": ""propaganda""}, {""id"": 2964, ""name"": ""future""}, {""id"": 4565, ""name"": ""dystopia""}, {""id"": 5740, ""name"": ""alliance""}, {""id"": 6186, ""name"": ""games""}, {""id"": 8570, ""name"": ""president""}, {""id"": 8862, ""name"": ""uprising""}, {""id"": 9663, ""name"": ""sequel""}, {""id"": 9826, ""name"": ""murder""}, {""id"": 10349, ""name"": ""survival""}, {""id"": 10410, ""name"": ""conspiracy""}, {""id"": 11196, ""name"": ""rebellion""}, {""id"": 11221, ""name"": ""blood""}, {""id"": 11322, ""name"": ""female protagonist""}, {""id"": 12380, ""name"": ""tournament""}, {""id"": 14601, ""name"": ""explosion""}, {""id"": 15017, ""name"": ""danger""}, {""id"": 156395, ""name"": ""imax""}, {""id"": 171956, ""name"": ""winner""}, {""id"": 223438, ""name"": ""based on young adult novel""}]",en,"Katniss Everdeen has returned home safe after winning the 74th Annual Hunger Games along with fellow tribute Peeta Mellark.

610,611,Paranormal Activity,2010,/wiki/Paranormal_Activity,"Young couple Katie and Micah move to a new house in San Diego. Katie claims an evil presence has been haunting her since she was a child, so Micah sets up a camera in their bedroom to record any paranormal activity that occurs while they sleep. A famous psychic Dr. Fredrichs, who reveals that Katie is being haunted by a demon that feeds off of negative energy and is intent on tormenting Katie,  advises them not to communicate with the demon and to contact demonologist Dr. Johann Averies if needed. Katie seems interested, but Micah does not take this seriously.The camera manages to capture many strange occurrences, which are minor at first, such as noises, flickering lights, and doors moving on their own. However, Micah taunts and mocks the demon, worsening the situation. During the thirteenth night, the demon angrily screeches and there is a loud thud, causing the entire house to vibrate. Voice recorder tests are conducted by Micah the following morning, which reveal demonic grunting when Micah asks if it would like to use a Ouija board. During the fifteenth night, Katie, in an apparent trance, stands beside the bed and stares at Micah for two hours before going outside. Micah tries to convince Katie to go back inside, but she refuses and appears to remember none of it the next day.Micah brings home a Ouija board, which infuriates Katie. When they leave the house, the camera records an unseen force moving the planchette to form an unknown message on the Ouija board, which then spontaneously catches fire. Katie sees the video and pleads with Micah to contact the demonologist, but again he refuses. During the seventeenth night, Micah sprinkles baby powder in the hallway and outside the bedroom door. The couple are awakened by creaks, and find non-human footprints leading to the attic, where Micah finds a burnt photograph of a young Katie (same picture from the second film). Katie finally calls the demonologist, Dr. Averies, but he is out of the country.The events of the seventeenth night have psychologically terrified the couple, which in turn has strengthened the demon. Over the next few nights, the paranormal activity is excessive and intense. They eventually call Dr. Fredrichs back to the house, but he is overwhelmed by the demonic energy upon entering. He apologetically leaves despite their pleas, stating that his presence only makes the demon angrier. The bleak reality causes the couple to lose all hope, which makes the demon strong enough to be able to pull Katie out of the bedroom and bite her, causing her to become fully possessed. Micah discovers the bite mark and—deciding events are too out of control to remain in the house—he packs to head to a motel. Just as they are set to leave, the possessed Katie insists they will be okay now.The following night, Katie gets out of bed and stares at Micah for two hours before going downstairs. After a moment of silence, Katie screams for Micah; he abruptly rushes to help her. Afterward, Micah exclaims in pain, Katie stops screaming, and then heavy footsteps are heard coming upstairs. Suddenly, Micahs body is violently hurled at the camera, which is knocked off the tripod, revealing a demonic Katie standing in the doorway. She slowly walks into the room, stained with blood, and crawls to Micahs body, then looks up at the camera with a grin. As she lunges toward the camera, her face takes on a demonic appearance just as the scene cuts to black.

611,612,The Ides of March,2011,/wiki/The_Ides_of_March_(2011_film),"Stephen Meyers is the junior campaign manager for Governor Mike Morris, who is competing against Senator Ted Pullman in the Democratic presidential primary. Both campaigns are vying for the endorsement of Senator Franklin Thompson, who controls 356 delegates that would clinch the nomination for either candidate. Meyers is asked by Pullmans campaign manager, Tom Duffy, to meet in secret. Meyers calls his boss, Morris campaign manager Paul Zara, who does not answer. Meyers decides to meet with Duffy, who offers him a position in Pullmans campaign; Meyers refuses. When Zara calls back, Meyers does not tell him about the meeting. Meyers starts a sexual relationship with Molly Stearns, an attractive intern whose father is the chairman of the Democratic National Committee. Meyers admits to an angry Zara that he met with Duffy, who said that Pullman will offer Thompson the position of Secretary of State in exchange for his endorsement. Zara and Meyers discuss the matter with Morris, saying they must make the same offer to Thompson. Morris refuses on principle, as he thoroughly disagrees with Thompson and his policies, and wants a ""clean"" campaign without such deals.While Molly is sleeping, Meyers finds that Morris is trying to call her after he picks up her phone by mistake. He discovers that they had a brief sexual liaison several weeks previously, and Molly is now pregnant with Morriss child. Molly needs $900 for an abortion, but cannot tell her father because her family is Catholic. Meyers helps her with the money but warns her not to tell anybody, and fires her from the campaign to make the problem go away. Ida Horowicz, a reporter for The New York Times, reveals to Meyers that an anonymous source leaked his meeting with Duffy, and plans to publish an article unless Meyers gives her the details about the Morris campaigns overtures to Thompson.After dropping Molly off at the abortion clinic, Meyers goes to Zara for help. Zara reveals that he leaked the meeting to Ida with Morris approval as a pretext for firing Meyers over his purported disloyalty. An angry and desperate Meyers then offers his services to Duffy, who admits he only met with Meyers to influence his opponents operation under the likelihood that either Meyers would come to work for him or be fired for taking the meeting. Duffy apologizes for using Meyers and advises him to quit politics before he becomes a cynic like him. Meyers offers to sell out Morris but Duffy declines, believing Thompsons endorsement of Pullman is assured. Having been told that Meyers had threatened to take down the campaign, Molly fatally overdoses on pills in a hotel room. Meyers comes across the scene and steals her phone. Unbeknownst to the Morris campaign, he meets with Thompson to set the conditions for his endorsement and his delegates. Meyers confronts Morris and gives him an ultimatum: either give him Zaras job and offer Thompson his post, or Meyers goes the press with Mollys purported suicide note and expose the affair. Morris relents, giving up what is left of his personal integrity, and meets Meyers demands. Zara takes his firing philosophically and is amicable when he chats with Meyers at Mollys funeral.Thompson officially endorses Morris, making him the de facto Democratic nominee. Now senior campaign manager, Meyers is on the way to a remote TV interview with John King when Ida ambushes him and says her next story will be about how Meyers delivered Thompson and his delegates and got his promotion. He reacts by having security bar her from coming any further. Meyers takes his seat for the interview, just as Morris finishes a speech about how ""integrity and dignity"" matter, and is asked for insight as to how the events surrounding the primary unfolded.",12500000,"[{""id"": 18, ""name"": ""Drama""}]",http://www.sonypictures.com/movies/theidesofmarch/,10316,"[{""id"": 2494, ""name"": ""ohio""}, {""id"": 6078, ""name"": ""politics""}, {""id"": 12389, ""name"": ""dirty tricks""}, {""id"": 187306, ""name"": ""presidential campaign""}, {""id"": 187307, ""name"": ""endorsement""}, {""id"": 187308, ""name"": ""campaign speech""}, {""id"": 187309, ""name"": ""presidential debate""}]",en,Dirty tricks stand to soil an ambitious young press spokesman's idealism in a cutthroat presidential campaign where 'victory' is relative.,20.317469,"[{""name"": ""Appian Way"", ""id"": 562}, {""name"": ""Crystal City Entertainment"", ""id"": 9018}, {""name"": ""Cross Creek Pictures"", ""id"": 10246}, {""name"": ""Exclusive Media Group"", ""id"": 11448}, {""name"": ""Smokehouse Pictures"", ""id"": 22695}]","[{""iso_3166_1"": ""US"", ""name"": ""United States of America""}]",9/24/2011,75993061,101,"[{""iso_639_1"": ""en"", ""name"": ""English""}]",Released,Ambition seduces.

613,614,The Internship,2013,/wiki/The_Internship,"Salesmen Billy McMahon and Nick Campbells employer goes out of business, and Billy applies for Google internships on their behalf. They are accepted due to their unorthodox interview answers, despite a lack of relevant experience. They are the only interns not of traditional collegiate age. They will spend the summer competing in teams against other interns in a variety of tasks, and only the members of the winning team will be guaranteed jobs with Google. Billy and Nick are teamed with other interns seen as rejects: Stuart, who is usually engrossed in his smart phone; Yo-Yo, a Filipino-American who was homeschooled by his tiger mother; and Neha, an Indian-American who is an enthusiast of nerd-related kink. The team is led by Lyle, who constantly tries to act hip in order to hide his insecurities. Another intern, Graham, bullies Billy and Nicks team. Mr. Chetty, the head of the internship program, also expresses his doubts about the older mens abilities. Stuart, Yo-Yo, and Neha see Billy and Nick as useless during a task focused on debugging and send them on a wild-goose chase for the fictional Charles Xavier at Stanford University. But later, during a game of Quidditch against Grahams team, Billy rallies his team to a comeback that unifies them as a team, despite ultimately losing after Graham cheats.When the teams are tasked with developing an app, Billy and Nick convince the team to indulge in a wild night out. At a strip club, Neha admits to Billy that, despite her rich fantasy life, she has no real world experience and is nervous. With his support, she decides to stay. Nick gets Yo-Yo to break out of his shell by drinking and receiving lap dances. Encouraged by Billy, Lyle approaches one of the dancers, Marielena, who is also a dance instructor at Google on whom he had developed a crush. She is charmed by him, but another customer challenges Lyle for her attention and they fight, getting the team kicked out. Before sunrise, Stuart learns to appreciate his surroundings while overlooking the Golden Gate Bridge, and Lyles drunken antics inspire the team to create an app that guards against reckless phone usage while drunk. They win the task by earning the most downloads.Meanwhile, Nick has been flirting with an executive, Dana, with little success. When he begins attending technical presentations to impress her, he develops an interest in the material. While the teams prepare to staff the technical support hotline, only Billy feels at a loss. A Google employee, ""Headphones,"" who always wears headphones and never socializes, approaches Billy and tells him that the way he interacts with people is special. He tutors Billy on the technical information. Dana agrees to go on a date with Nick, and she invites him in at the end of the evening. During the task, Billy is comfortable with the material, but his team receives no score because he failed to properly log his calls for review. Dejected, Billy leaves Google to pursue a new sales opportunity with his former boss. The final task is announced as a sales challenge. Teams must sign the largest possible company to begin advertising with Google. The team is stunned when Nick tells them that Billy has left, and they declare that they do not want to do the task without him. Nick convinces Billy to return, and Billy leads the team to show a local pizzeria owner how Google can help him interact with potential customers and thereby expand his business, while remaining true to his professional values.Chetty is about to announce that Grahams team have won, when Billy, Nick, and their team arrive to give a dynamic presentation about their new client. Chetty recognizes that although the pizzeria is not a large business, its potential is limitless because it is expanding via technology. Graham protests and is dressed down by Headphones, who turns out to be the head of Google Search. Nick and Billys team win the challenge and the guaranteed jobs. Graham berates his team, who finally reject him. As the students depart, Nick and Dana are still seeing each other, as are Lyle and Marielena.

614,615,The Joneses,2010,/wiki/The_Joneses,"Kate, Steve, Mick, and Jenn Jones move into an upscale suburb under the pretense of being a typical family relocating because of the changing nature of Kates and Steves careers. In reality, Kate is the leader of a team of stealth marketers, professional salespeople who disguise product placement as a daily routine. Their clothing, accessories, furniture, and even food are carefully planned and stocked by various companies to create visibility in a desirable consumer market. While Kates team is highly effective, Steve is new to the team, Jenn is a closet nymphomaniac with a penchant for hitting on her fake fathers, and a 30-day review is fast approaching. The team quickly ingratiates itself into the community, slowly shifting from displaying products to recommending them. Soon, local stores and businesses are stocking products based on the Joneses trend-setting styles. However, at the end of the 30-day review, Steve discovers that he has the lowest sales numbers of the team, and Kates job is endangered unless he can get his numbers up before the next review in 60 days. Eventually, Steve begins to find a sales tactic that works by playing on the fears of his neighbors and sympathizing with their dull, repetitive, unfulfilled careers. As someone who is frustrated with his job and disconnected from his fake ""family,"" Steve turned to their products to keep himself entertained. When he recognizes this same pattern in his neighbors, his sales begin to steadily increase as he starts pitching products as the solution for suburban boredom and generating product ""buzz"" through unwitting ropers.The teams dynamics become more complicated when Kate applies herself to the technique as well. Realizing that they can boost sales by perfecting their fake family dynamic to sell the image of a lifestyle, the lines between acting and reality start to break down. Things also get more complicated when Mick finds himself growing closer to an unpopular girl at the high school, Naomi (Christine Evangelista), in whom he can confide, while Jenns flirtation with Alex Bayner (Robert Pralgo) (one of the men in the neighborhood) raises the suspicions of the neighbors. The teams cover is almost blown at several times: once when an old acquaintance of Steves recognizes him at a restaurant, again when Jenns indiscretions nearly expose her real age, and after a party where Mick markets alcohol to minors.Eventually, each member of the team finds that the constant pretense slowly erodes their individual desires. Jenns dreams of running away with a rich, older man come to a close when she realizes that she was being used by Alex.

617,618,The Killer Inside Me,2010,/wiki/The_Killer_Inside_Me_(2010_film),"In 1952, Deputy Sheriff Lou Ford (Casey Affleck) is a pillar of the community in his small west Texas town—patient, dependable, and well-liked. However, he is a sociopath with violent sexual tastes. As a teenager, Lou was caught raping a five-year-old girl by his adopted brother Mike, who pleaded guilty to the crime and served prison time to protect Lou. After being released, Mike was hired by the construction firm of Chester Conway (Ned Beatty). Mike died on the job after slipping and falling off a beam. Lou believes that Conway staged the ""accident"".At the request of Sheriff Bob Maples (Tom Bower), Lou visits Joyce Lakeland (Jessica Alba), a prostitute who is having an affair with Conways son, Elmer (Jay R. Ferguson). When Joyce objects to Lous treatment of her, he violently beats and spanks her until her buttocks are bruised. Joyce enjoys pain, and she and Lou begin a passionate love affair. Joyce suggests that Lou would never leave town with her, but they devise a plot to extort $10,000 from the Conways. Sheriff Maples and Chester Conway ask Lou to oversee the pay-off. But Lou has other plans: he brutally beats Joyce to the point he believes her to be dead, and when Elmer arrives, Lou shoots and kills him. He then plants the gun on Joyce, hoping to make the scene look like the two have killed each other, however Joyce survives the ordeal. Then Conway announces his intention to see her executed for killing Elmer.Lous reputation begins to falter: his girlfriend and fiancée Amy (Kate Hudson) suspects him of infidelity, and the county district attorney Howard Hendricks (Simon Baker), who has arrived in town to investigate the murders, suspects that Lou could be the killer. Lou accompanies Sheriff Maples and Conway in taking Joyce to the hospital in Fort Worth; Conway wants her alive so he can interrogate her. Lou waits in a hotel room while the surgery takes place. Maples tells him that Joyce died on the operating table. Lou and Maples return to west Texas. Back at his home, Lou discovers explicit photographs of a woman inside a Bible. The woman was Helene, a housekeeper and babysitter from his youth who bears a resemblance to Joyce. Lou recalls that Helene introduced him to sadomasochism, urging him to strike her. Lou burns the photos.Hendricks arrests Johnnie Pappas (Liam Aiken), a local youth whom Lou had previously befriended as a suspect in the murders of Elmer and Joyce. He was found with one of the $20 bills that Elmer was supposed to give to Joyce in the pay-off; Conway had the bills marked in order to blackmail Joyce if she didnt leave town. Because Lou is close to Johnnie, Hendricks asks Lou to persuade him to confess, but it was Lou himself who had given Johnnie the marked $20 bill as a tip. In the prison cell Lou confesses to Johnnie that he was the one responsible. When they are alone in his cell, Lou hangs Johnnie to make it appear as though he committed suicide out of guilt.Johnnies death only makes the town more suspicious of Lou. Journalist and union organizer Joe Rothman (Elias Koteas), who had previously suggested that Conway had Lous foster brother Mike killed, implies that he knows that Lou killed Elmer and Joyce. Lou coaxes Amy to elope with him as he proposes to her. To sate Lous violent predilections, she acquiesces to his desire to spank her. An alcoholic bum (Brent Briscoe), whom Lou had previously burnt with a cigar, has been trailing Lou and knows that he was responsible for the murders of Elmer and Joyce. He demands $5,000 to keep quiet, to which Lou agrees. On the day which Lou and Amy had planned to elope, Lou beats Amy to death, and when the bum sees her body, he runs for help. Lou chases the bum, shouting that he has murdered Amy. Another deputy, Jeff Plummer (Matthew Maher) opens fire on the bum, and shoots him dead. The next morning Plummer informs Lou of Sheriff Maples suicide, convinced of Lous guilt and heartbroken over his crimes. Hendricks and Plummer try to get a confession from Lou, who cockily refuses. They have a letter that Amy intended to give to him before they eloped, in which Amy begs him to come clean. Lou is arrested, and after a week in prison is sent to an insane asylum. While there, he suffers hallucinations of Amy and Helene. After a few weeks, a slick lawyer named Billy Boy Walker (Bill Pullman) has him released and drives him home. Walker has been hired by Joe Rothman to protect the union man. Lou tells Walker his whole story and concludes that he doesnt want anyone else to die.  Lost in his violent fantasies, Lou douses his home in gasoline and alcohol, arms himself with a knife, and sits in his study to await retribution. As police vehicles and armed policemen arrive, Lou sees a car pull up with Hendricks, Conway, Plummer and the still-alive Joyce. As Joyce tells Lou that she refused to cooperate with the authorities, Lou tells her he loves her, then stabs her in the stomach. Plummer opens fire, hitting both Joyce and Lou and igniting the gasoline in the house. Outside, the approaching policemen see the house engulfed in a huge fireball, which it appears Lou has ignited to kill himself.",13000000,"[{""id"": 80, ""name"": ""Crime""}, {""id"": 18, ""name"": ""Drama""}, {""id"": 53, ""name"": ""Thriller""}]",http://www.killerinsideme.com/,37414,"[{""id"": 798, ""name"": ""sheriff""}, {""id"": 853, ""name"": ""crime fighter""}]",en,"Deputy Sheriff Lou Ford is a pillar of the community in his small west Texas town, patient and apparently thoughtful.

618,619,Paranormal Activity,2010,/wiki/Paranormal_Activity,"Young couple Katie and Micah move to a new house in San Diego. Katie claims an evil presence has been haunting her since she was a child, so Micah sets up a camera in their bedroom to record any paranormal activity that occurs while they sleep. A famous psychic Dr. Fredrichs, who reveals that Katie is being haunted by a demon that feeds off of negative energy and is intent on tormenting Katie,  advises them not to communicate with the demon and to contact demonologist Dr. Johann Averies if needed. Katie seems interested, but Micah does not take this seriously.The camera manages to capture many strange occurrences, which are minor at first, such as noises, flickering lights, and doors moving on their own. However, Micah taunts and mocks the demon, worsening the situation. During the thirteenth night, the demon angrily screeches and there is a loud thud, causing the entire house to vibrate. Voice recorder tests are conducted by Micah the following morning, which reveal demonic grunting when Micah asks if it would like to use a Ouija board. During the fifteenth night, Katie, in an apparent trance, stands beside the bed and stares at Micah for two hours before going outside. Micah tries to convince Katie to go back inside, but she refuses and appears to remember none of it the next day.Micah brings home a Ouija board, which infuriates Katie. When they leave the house, the camera records an unseen force moving the planchette to form an unknown message on the Ouija board, which then spontaneously catches fire. Katie sees the video and pleads with Micah to contact the demonologist, but again he refuses. During the seventeenth night, Micah sprinkles baby powder in the hallway and outside the bedroom door. The couple are awakened by creaks, and find non-human footprints leading to the attic, where Micah finds a burnt photograph of a young Katie (same picture from the second film). Katie finally calls the demonologist, Dr. Averies, but he is out of the country.The events of the seventeenth night have psychologically terrified the couple, which in turn has strengthened the demon. Over the next few nights, the paranormal activity is excessive and intense. They eventually call Dr. Fredrichs back to the house, but he is overwhelmed by the demonic energy upon entering. He apologetically leaves despite their pleas, stating that his presence only makes the demon angrier. The bleak reality causes the couple to lose all hope, which makes the demon strong enough to be able to pull Katie out of the bedroom and bite her, causing her to become fully possessed. Micah discovers the bite mark and—deciding events are too out of control to remain in the house—he packs to head to a motel. Just as they are set to leave, the possessed Katie insists they will be okay now.The following night, Katie gets out of bed and stares at Micah for two hours before going downstairs. After a moment of silence, Katie screams for Micah; he abruptly rushes to help her. Afterward, Micah exclaims in pain, Katie stops screaming, and then heavy footsteps are heard coming upstairs. Suddenly, Micahs body is violently hurled at the camera, which is knocked off the tripod, revealing a demonic Katie standing in the doorway. She slowly walks into the room, stained with blood, and crawls to Micahs body, then looks up at the camera with a grin. As she lunges toward the camera, her face takes on a demonic appearance just as the scene cuts to black.

619,620,The Last Airbender,2010,/wiki/The_Last_Airbender,"15-year-old Sokka and his 14-year-old sister Katara, are near a river at the Southern Water Tribe, a small village in the South Pole. While hunting, they discover an iceberg that when broken open shoots a beam of light into the sky. Inside of the iceberg is a 12-year-old boy named Aang and a giant flying bison named Appa. Unknown to them, Aang is the long-lost Avatar – the only person capable of ""bending"" all 4 elements of Air, Water, Earth and Fire. A century has passed since the Fire Nation has declared war on the other 3 nations of Air, Water, and Earth in their attempt to conquer the world.Zuko is the scarred 16-year-old exiled prince of the Fire Nation on a quest to find the Avatar and bring him to his father, Fire Lord Ozai, so he can regain his honor. Seeing the light that appeared from Aangs release, Zuko and some Fire Nation soldiers arrive at the Southern Water Tribe to demand the villagers hand over the Avatar. Aang reveals himself and surrenders to Zuko on the condition that he agrees to leave the village alone. On the ship, Aang is tested by Zukos paternal uncle Iroh to confirm he is the Avatar. After being informed that he is to be their prisoner for passing the test, Aang escapes using his glider and flies to his flying bison brought by Katara and Sokka. Aang and his new friends visit the Southern Air Temple where they meet a winged lemur, who Aang later names Momo. There, Aang learns that he was in the ice for a whole century and that the Fire Nation wiped out all of the Air Nomads, including his guardian, Monk Gyatso. In despair, he enters the Avatar State and finds himself in the Spirit World where he encounters a Dragon Spirit. Kataras pleas bring Aang back out of the Avatar State.To seek shelter, Aangs group arrives at a little Earth Kingdom village controlled by the Fire Nation, but they are arrested and taken to a prison for Earthbenders surrounded by earth  after Katara attempts to help a young Earthbender boy escape from Fire Nation soldiers. They incite a rebellion by reminding the disgruntled Earthbenders that Earth was given to them. After battling and defeating the Fire Nation soldiers occupying the village, Aang tells Katara and Sokka that he only knows airbending and he must master the other three elements. Katara is given a waterbending scroll that she uses to greatly strengthen and hone her waterbending abilities and to help Aang learn as they make their way to the Northern Water Tribe (where Aang will be able to learn from waterbending masters) and liberate more Earth Kingdom villages in the process, weakening the Fire Nations food and water supplies.During a side track to the Northern Air Temple on his own, Aang is betrayed by a Southern Earth Kingdom peasant and captured by a group of Fire Nation archers, led by Commander Zhao, a Fire Nation Commander appointed by the Fire Lord. However, a masked marauder, the ""Blue Spirit"", helps Aang escape from his imprisonment, fighting off the Fire Nation soldiers under Zhaos command until the Blue Spirit realises they will be overwhelmed, at which point he takes Aang hostage to negotiate their way out. During the prison break, Zhao realizes that Zuko is the masked vigilante. He arranges to kill the prince, first by having a crossbowman fire a bolt over a huge distance that shatters the lower half of Zukos mask and knocks him out, however Aang uses his skills to bend a cloud across the bridge connecting the prison to the other side of the valley, causing the Fire Nation soldiers in pursuit to stop in fear. With the cloud covering their escape, Aang escapes with an unconscious Zuko into a nearby forest and watches over him until morning, when he leaves to reunite with Sokka and Katara. Zhao tries again to kill Zuko, this time by rupturing a gas pipe running through Zukos quarters on Irohs ship. Noticing the danger, Zuko manages to survive the attempt on his life with Irohs help. He sneaks aboard Zhaos lead ship as his fleet departs for the Northern Water Tribe, which is a heavy fortress, to capture the Avatar. Upon arriving, Aangs group is welcomed warmly by the citizens of the Northern Water Tribe. Sokka quickly befriends the Northern Water Tribe princess, Yue. After a few agreements, a waterbending master, Pakku, teaches Aang waterbending. Katara also becomes a much stronger and more powerful waterbender due to her training with Master Pakku.Soon, the Fire Nation arrives and Zhao begins his attack while Zuko begins his search for the Avatar on his own. After defeating Katara in a battle, Zuko captures Aang as he enters the Spirit World to find the Dragon Spirit to give him the wisdom to defeat the Fire Nation who tells him to let his emotions ""flow like water"". Returning to his body, Aang battles Zuko before Katara freezes him in ice. Before leaving to join the battle, Aang lowers the ice so that Zuko can breathe. As the battle escalates, Iroh and Zhao make their way to a sacred cave where Iroh watches Zhao capture the Moon Spirit, which has assumed the form of a fish along with its Ocean Spirit counterpart. Despite Irohs pleas, Zhao kills the Moon Spirit to strip all of the waterbenders of their ability to waterbend. Iroh, enraged by Zhaos disrespect for sacredness and by his actions to unbalance the world, reveals the extent of his mastery of firebending by using his chi to create huge flame jets from his wrists, scaring Zhao and his entourage of Fire Nation Soldiers out of the sacred cave. Princess Yue explains to everyone that the Moon Spirit gave her life and, with Irohs help, realises she can give her life back to the Moon Spirit to revive it, and she dies in the process. With the tables turned, Zhao finds out Zuko survived. They almost fight before Iroh appears and tells Zuko its not worth it. Zhao attempts one more time to kill Zuko with a massive blast of fire, which Iroh manages to deflect. Zuko and Iroh leave Zhao to his fate as he is drowned by waterbenders. Aang remembers his life before being trapped in the ice, including when he left his home, seeing his masters face. With his waterbending powers and his emotions ""flowing like water"", Aang enters the Avatar State and raises the ocean into a gigantic wall to drive the armada back.

620,621,The Last Exorcism,2010,/wiki/The_Last_Exorcism,"Filmmakers Iris and Daniel follow Cotton Marcus, a reverend living in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, who seeks to delegitimize exorcisms. Marcus, who lost his faith after the birth of his ill son, is accustomed to performing fake exorcisms on ""possessed"" individuals. He accepts an exorcism request sent by farmer Louis Sweetzer, who claims his livestock are being slaughtered by his daughter Nell; Louis suspects that Nell is possessed by Satan.Marcus arrives and claims Nell is possessed by Abalam, a powerful demon. He persuades the family that he has driven out the demon and leaves, believing he and his crew have cured her of a mental state that was misdiagnosed as possession. That night, Nell appears in Marcus motel room, visibly unwell. Marcus takes Nell to the hospital for tests, which conclude that she is in perfect physical condition. Marcus goes to see Louis former pastor, Joseph Manley, who informs Marcus that he has not seen Nell for three years. In the morning, Louis takes Nell home but chains her to the bed after she cuts her brother Calebs face with a knife.Marcus frees Nell from her restraints and later finds her trying to drown a doll while seemingly sleepwalking. When everyone learns Nell is pregnant, Iris accuses Louis of incest, which Marcus rejects. That night, Nell steals their camera and goes into her fathers barn, where she brutally smashes a cat to death. Iris and Daniel discover her morbid paintings; in addition to the death of the cat, they depict Marcus standing before a large flame with a crucifix, Iris dismembered, and Daniel decapitated. Marcus confronts Louis about Nells pregnancy; Louis insists that Nell is a virgin and has been impregnated by the demon. Offended at Marcus insistence that a demon is not involved, Louis demands that the crew leave and alludes to intending to kill Nell. The crew tries to escape with Nell, who attacks Marcus before Louis threatens to shoot her. Marcus offers to attempt a second exorcism to dissuade him as Nell begs Louis to kill her.During the exorcism, ""Abalam"" agrees to release Nell only if Marcus can remain silent for ten seconds. Each second, Nell breaks one of her fingers. After three, Marcus yells for Abalam to stop; Abalam asks Marcus if he wants a ""blowing job"". Marcus challenges that a demon would know the actual name of the sex act and concludes that Nell is not possessed, but a disturbed and ashamed girl. Nell anguishes over losing her virginity to a boy named Logan, which Louis again rejects. Marcus and the crew meet Logan, who explains that he is homosexual and the only contact he had with Nell was a brief conversation at Manleys house six months ago; the crew realizes Manley was lying about having not seen Nell. They return to the Sweetzer farmhouse, which they find empty and covered with numerous occult and countercultural symbols on its walls.The group follows the sound of voices into the woods, where they see a large fire and a congregation of hooded cultists led by Manley. Louis is tied up, gagged and blindfolded while hooded figures pray around an altar, atop which Nell is bound. She gives birth to an inhuman child. Manley throws the child into the fire, which causes the fire to grow rapidly as demonic roars emanate. Marcus, his faith restored, grabs his cross and rushes towards the fire to combat the evil. Iris and Daniel flee, and Iris is subdued by members of the congregation and killed with an ax. Daniel continues to run before Caleb decapitates him and the camera falls.",1800000,"[{""id"": 27, ""name"": ""Horror""}, {""id"": 18, ""name"": ""Drama""}, {""id"": 53, ""name"": ""Thriller""}]",http://thelastexorcism.com/,38358,"[{""id"": 2626, ""name"": ""exorcism""}, {""id"": 4373, ""name"": ""fraud""}, {""id"": 10114, ""name"": ""evil spirit""}, {""id"": 10864, ""name"": ""human sacrifice""}, {""id"": 11800, ""name"": ""mockumentary""}, {""id"": 18072, ""name"": ""preacher""}, {""id"": 161270, ""name"": ""satanic ritual""}, {""id"": 163053, ""name"": ""found footage""}, {""id"": 163055, ""name"": ""satanic cult""}]",en,"After years of performing “exorcisms” and taking believers’ money, Reverend Marcus travels to rural Louisiana with a film crew so he can dispel what he believes is the myth of demonic possession.

621,622,The Last Stand,2013,/wiki/The_Last_Stand_(2013_film),"Sheriff Ray Owens is a man who has resigned himself to a life of fighting what little crime takes place in sleepy border town Sommerton Junction, Arizona. He left his LAPD post following a bungled operation and leaving him wracked with failure and defeat after his partner was crippled and his team decimated. The crimes experienced in Sommerton range from the mayor parking his Camaro in the fire lane to vintage arms collector Lewis Dinkum firing off guns at slabs of meat with the deputies.One night, international drug lord and race car driver Gabriel Cortez makes a daring escape from FBI custody in Las Vegas and speeds off in a modified Chevrolet Corvette C6 ZR1, taking Agent Ellen Richards as his hostage as he races southbound toward Mexico at speeds over 200 mph. Agent John Bannister has a blockade set up in Bullhead City, Arizona, but Cortezs men mow down the police officers on site and clear the road for him to continue his getaway. Cortez also uses his extraordinary driving skills to immobilize two SWAT vehicles headed toward Summerton Junction. Before flying to Arizona, Agent Bannister has his team do a financial background check on all agents involved to find out how Cortez managed to escape so easily.Sometime past 4:30 in the morning, Owens dispatches deputies Jerry Bailey and Sarah Torrance to visit the residence of the local farmer Parsons, who has suddenly missed his usual milk delivery at the diner. After discovering that Parsons has been murdered, the deputies follow a trail of tire tracks that lead them to Cortezs henchman Thomas Burrell and his mercenary cutthroats, who are planting a mobile assault bridge across the canyon that marks the U.S./Mexico border. Bailey is fatally shot in the middle of a shootout between the deputies and the thugs before Owens rushes in to bring his officers back to his precinct. Shortly after being notified by Agent Bannister of Cortezs presence, Owens gathers Torrance and senior Deputy Mike ""Figgy"" Figuerola. He also deputizes jailed local Frank Martinez, a former US Marine who is a veteran of the Iraq War with PTSD who developed a streak of never finishing what he started; because Bailey was his friend, Martinez insists that he will not falter. Finally, Owens recruits Dinkum to protect their town. Dinkum agrees only if he becomes a deputy and if he keeps the gun Owens had confiscated earlier.At 7:10 a.m., Owens and his deputies, equipped with weapons from Dinkums private museum, have the towns main road barricaded with cars when Burrell and his men arrive, prompting a lengthy firefight. Armed with a Tommy gun, Figuerola holds off the thugs before being injured by a sniper. Owens and Dinkum mow down a majority of the thugs with a Vickers machine gun mounted on the back of a school bus with Martinez providing cover fire, while Torrance snipes several gunmen on the rooftops. After Owens kills Burrell, Cortezs Corvette eventually arrives in town, veering past the barricade as Owens and the deputies shoot it. Cortez ejects Agent Richards from the car before speeding through a corn field. Suddenly, he encounters the mayors Camaro commandeered by Owens before both cars collide with a swather. A dazed Cortez continues his escape on foot, but Owens meets him at the bridge. Owens ignores Cortezs bribe offers before both men fight each other. Despite sustaining slashes and stab wounds from Cortezs push dagger, Owens defeats the drug lord and handcuffs him before dragging him back into town using the battered and now roofless Camaro. Agent Bannister arrives to take Cortez back into custody and arrests Agent Richards for taking the drug lords bribe and aiding in his escape. Deputies Figuerola and Dinkum are taken to the hospital to be treated for their wounds. Martinez turns in the deputys badge, Baileys badge, that Owens had given him earlier. Owens tells him to keep it, as hes earned it. As the mayor sees what is left of his Camaro, Owens warns him about parking in the fire lane before he, Torrance and Martinez walk into the diner.",30000000,"[{""id"": 28, ""name"": ""Action""}, {""id"": 80, ""name"": ""Crime""}, {""id"": 53, ""name"": ""Thriller""}]",http://www.thelaststandfilm.com,76640,"[{""id"": 798, ""name"": ""sheriff""}, {""id"": 1415, ""name"": ""small town""}, {""id"": 1562, ""name"": ""hostage""}, {""id"": 1563, ""name"": ""prisoner""}, {""id"": 1812, ""name"": ""fbi""}, {""id"": 2286, ""name"": ""border""}, {""id"": 10685, ""name"": ""escape""}, {""id"": 15483, ""name"": ""car chase""}, {""id"": 155499, ""name"": ""convoy""}, {""id"": 156650, ""name"": ""machine gun""}, {""id"": 168713, ""name"": ""neo-western""}]",en,"Ray Owens is sheriff of the quiet US border town of Sommerton Junction after leaving the LAPD following a bungled operation.

It was intended to assist coma patients but is shown to actually be able to bring the dead back to life.With the assistance of their friends, Niko (Donald Glover), Clay (Evan Peters),  and videographer Eva (Sarah Bolger), they run a successful trial on a recently deceased dog. However, they notice that the dog is behaving differently than it did when it was alive: its cataracts disappear, it loses its appetite, and it demonstrates other strange abilities. Tests reveal that the serum, instead of dissipating, is constructing strange new synapses within the dog’s brain.When the dean of their university learns of their underground experiments, their project is shut down. They are also informed that a major pharmaceutical corporation has bought out the company that funded their research. The company and their attorneys confiscate everything associated with the project.Frank and his team sneak back into their lab to duplicate the experiment so that they can prove that they created the serum. During this attempt, things go horribly wrong and Zoe is fatally electrocuted. Unwilling to let her go, Frank uses the serum to resurrect her. Initially, the procedure appears to be a success, but the team soon realizes that something is wrong with Zoe. She claims that when she died, she went to her version of Hell, which was a nightmare originating from her childhood: during a fire in her apartment building, she witnessed trapped neighbors burning to death. She also begins to demonstrate unusual psychic abilities.The serum causes brains to ""evolve"" incredibly rapidly, giving Zoe superhuman powers such as telekinesis and telepathy. It also causes increased aggression and insanity. Zoe eventually finds Eva and sends her into the Hell that she went to when she died. Inside the nightmare, it is revealed that Zoe was the one that caused the fire in the building, causing her to go to Hell upon death. Niko walks into a room and is surprised by Zoe. After he refuses to kiss her, she uses telekinesis to throw him into a locker and crush it with him inside, killing him. Using her new abilities, she cuts the power to the entire lab. When Clay demands to know where Niko is, she kills him as well by lodging an e-cigarette into his throat, resulting in him choking to death. Later, Zoe kills Frank after he attempts to inject her with poison. Zoe then injects herself with an entire bag of the serum, making her abilities stronger than before.Eva, who is still alive and trying to locate Zoe to inject her, is left in the dark. Zoe eventually finds Eva, who is able to escape and inject Zoe with the syringe, but that only happened in her mind and not reality; Zoe then kills Eva.

623,624,The Legend of Tarzan,2016,/wiki/The_Legend_of_Tarzan_(film),"As a result of the Berlin Conference of 1884-1885, the Congo Basin is claimed by King Leopold II of the Belgians, who rules the Congo Free State in personal union with the Kingdom of Belgium. The country is on the verge of bankruptcy, Leopold having borrowed huge amounts of money to finance the construction of railways and other infrastructure projects. He sends his envoy Léon Rom (Christoph Waltz) to secure the fabled diamonds of Opar. Roms expedition is ambushed and massacred. A tribal leader, Chief Mbonga (Djimon Hounsou), offers Rom the diamonds in exchange for an old enemy: Tarzan.The man once called ""Tarzan"", John Clayton III (Alexander Skarsgård), has left Africa behind and settled down in London with his American-born wife, Jane Porter (Margot Robbie). He took up his birth name and ancestral family residence as Lord Greystoke. In the eight years since returning from Africa, Johns story as Tarzan has become legendary among the Victorian public, although John wants to leave that past behind. Through the British Prime Minister (Jim Broadbent), John is invited by King Leopold to visit Boma and report on the development of the Congo by Belgium; he declines. An American envoy, George Washington Williams (Samuel L. Jackson), privately reveals his suspicions that Leopold is enslaving the Congolese population to increase rubber production to recoup his debts. Williams persuades Greystoke to go to the Congo in order to prove his suspicions. Jane is disappointed when Greystoke says that she should not come, as he thinks the trip would be too dangerous. Jane recently had a miscarriage and he remembers the harshness of the jungle. Jane reminds him that she grew up in Africa as well, and misses her home and friends there. John relents, and allows Jane to accompany him.John, Jane, and Williams take the trip to the Congo. There, the trio encounters a tribal village with people who knew John and Jane during their previous stay in the jungle. Jane explains to Williams that her husband was once considered an evil spirit by the African tribes, including that of Chief Mbonga. Jane recalls how, when she was younger, she and her father lived in the tribal village helping to care for local children. There she met Tarzan who had become feral after being orphaned and was raised by apes. He had saved Janes life by shielding her from a mangani attack, and suffered severe injuries. Jane took the injured Tarzan home, nursed him back to health, and the two fell in love. That night, as the tribe sleeps, Rom and his mercenaries raid the village, kidnap John and Jane, and kill the tribes leader. Roms team takes the captives to a nearby steamboat, but Williams rescues John before he can be taken away. With the aid of the tribes warriors, John and Williams intercept a Belgian military train carrying captured slaves, providing Williams with the evidence he needs to expose King Leopold. They also discover that Rom intends to use the diamonds to pay for a massive army to subdue the Congo, and allow Belgium to mine its wealth for Leopolds benefit. As John and Williams continue onward, John encounters the adult Akut, who is leader of the apes. Aware that Akut considers him a deserter, John prepares to fight Akut, though he soon loses. That night, as John recovers, Williams recalls the massacres of Native Americans during the Indian Wars, comparing them to the abuses of Rom and Leopold.On Roms steamboat, Jane dines with the leader before escaping and swimming to shore. She stumbles into a group of mangani apes, and is rescued by Rom, whose men shoot and kill many of the apes. John saves the remaining apes, reconciling with Akut, before pursuing Rom. He is cornered by Mbonga and his tribe. It is revealed that John had earlier killed Mbongas only son, who had killed Kala, an ape who was John’s adoptive mother. A defeated Mbonga accuses John of lacking honor, as his son was just a young boy when John killed him. John spares Mbonga, just as Akut and the manganis arrive to subdue the tribe. Rom takes Jane and the diamonds to Boma, where he plans to take control of the army. John, Williams and Akut trigger a massive stampede of wildebeest through Boma, destroying the town and distracting the soldiers; John rescues Jane. As Rom attempts to escape by boat, Williams sinks it with a machine gun as John swims aboard. Rom incapacitates John by strangling him and then tying him by the neck to the ships railing, before trying to escape again. John summons crocodiles with a mating call to devour Rom, before escaping the destroyed vessel.Williams returns to England and presents the Prime Minister with evidence exposing the slave trade and abuses of the Congolese in the Belgian-held lands. One year later, John and Jane have settled in Africa, in the old house of Janes father.

624,625,The Lincoln Lawyer,2011,/wiki/The_Lincoln_Lawyer_(film),"Criminal defense attorney Mickey Haller (Matthew McConaughey) operates around Los Angeles County, mostly from the back seat of his black Lincoln Town Car, chauffeured by Earl (Laurence Mason). Most of Hallers career has been defending garden-variety criminals, including a local biker club led by Eddie Vogel (Trace Adkins).A high-profile case comes his way and Haller is hired to represent wealthy Louis Roulet (Ryan Phillippe), a Beverly Hills playboy and son of real estate mogul Mary Windsor (Frances Fisher). Roulet is accused of brutally beating prostitute Regina Campo (Margarita Levieva). Roulet insists he is the innocent victim of a setup. Haller and his investigator, Frank Levin (William H. Macy) analyze photos and evidence and find it similar to one of Hallers past cases that resulted in a life sentence for his client, Jesus Martinez (Michael Peña), for murdering a woman, despite his repeatedly proclaiming his innocence.Hallers ex-wife, prosecutor Maggie McPherson (Marisa Tomei), has never appreciated Haller representing guilty clients, though they remain close. Haller wonders if he should have done more for Martinez rather than persuading him to plead guilty to avoid the death penalty. Haller visits the prison, where Martinez becomes agitated when Haller shows him Roulets photo. Haller now believes Roulet is the killer in the Martinez case, but, bound by attorney–client confidentiality rules, is unable to reveal what he knows.Roulet breaks into Hallers house and nonchalantly admits to committing the murder for which Martinez was convicted. He makes veiled threats toward Hallers ex-wife and their daughter. Levin is found shot to death after leaving Haller a voicemail message claiming that he found Martinezs ""ticket out of jail."" Levin was shot with a .22 caliber pistol, and Haller discovers that his late fathers .22 Colt Woodsman is missing from its box.Detective Lankford (Bryan Cranston), who dislikes Haller, discovers the guns registration and suspects Hallers involvement in Levins murder. Haller is certain that Roulet stole the weapon when he broke into Hallers home.Obliged to do his best for his client, guilty or not, Haller ruthlessly cross-examines Campo and discredits her in the jurys eyes. Haller then sets up a known prison informant with information on the previous murder. When the informant testifies, Haller discredits him, and the states attorney (Josh Lucas) can only move to dismiss all charges. Roulet is set free, to his mothers delight, but the police arrest him immediately for the previous murder, based upon testimony Haller coaxed from the informant.Haller acquires a pistol from his driver, Earl, for protection. Roulet is released due to lack of evidence and intends to kill Hallers ex-wife and daughter. Haller is waiting at Maggies house when Roulet arrives. He mockingly tells Haller that he cannot guard his family all the time. The bikers whom Haller previously represented suddenly arrive and brutally beat Roulet.Maggie discovers that Levin had found a parking ticket that was issued to Roulet near the previous murder victims house. It is strong evidence against Roulet in his pending murder trial and will support Martinezs innocence. Upon arriving home, Haller discovers Roulets mother, Mary Windsor, waiting inside. She shoots him with the Colt Woodsman, confessing that she murdered Levin to protect her son. A wounded Haller shoots her.When Haller is released from the hospital, he learns that Martinez has been released, and that the District Attorney will seek the death penalty against Roulet.

King Mufasas and Queen Sarabis newborn son, Simba, is presented to the gathering animals by Rafiki the baboon (with the colorful facial marking of a mandrill) who serves as the shaman and advisor. Mufasa shows Simba the Pride Lands and explains to him the responsibilities of kingship and the ""circle of life"", which connects all living things. Mufasas younger brother, Scar, covets the throne and plots to eliminate Mufasa and Simba, so he may become king. He tricks Simba and his best friend Nala—to whom Simba is betrothed—into exploring a forbidden elephants graveyard, where they are attacked by three spotted hyenas, Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed, who are in league with Scar. Mufasa is alerted about the incident by his majordomo, the hornbill Zazu, and rescues the cubs. Though upset with Simba, Mufasa forgives him and explains that the great kings of the past watch over them from the night sky, from which he will one day watch over Simba.Scar sets a trap for his brother and nephew, luring Simba into a gorge and having the hyenas drive a large herd of wildebeest into a stampede that will trample him. He informs Mufasa of Simbas peril, knowing the king will rush to save his son. Mufasa saves Simba but ends up hanging perilously from the gorges edge. Scar refuses to help Mufasa, instead sending him falling to his death. He then convinces Simba that the tragedy was Simbas own fault and advises him to leave the kingdom. He orders the hyenas to kill the cub, but Simba escapes. Scar tells the pride that both Mufasa and Simba were killed in the stampede and steps forward as the new king, allowing his three hyena minions and the rest of their large pack to live in the Pride Lands.Simba collapses in a desert and is rescued by Timon and Pumbaa, a meerkat and warthog, who are fellow outcasts. Simba grows up in the jungle with his two new friends, living a carefree life under the motto ""hakuna matata"" (""no worries"" in Swahili). Now a young adult, Simba rescues Timon and Pumbaa from a hungry lioness, who turns out to be Nala. She and Simba reunite and fall in love, and she urges him to return home, telling him the Pride Lands have become a drought-stricken wasteland under Scars reign. Feeling guilty over his fathers death, Simba refuses and storms off. He encounters Rafiki, who tells him that Mufasas spirit lives on in Simba. Simba is visited by the ghost of Mufasa in the night sky, who tells him he must take his rightful place as king. Realizing that he can no longer run from his past, Simba decides to return to the Pride Lands.Aided by his friends, Simba sneaks past the hyenas at Pride Rock and confronts Scar, who had just struck Sarabi. Scar taunts Simba over his role in Mufasas death and backs him to the edge of the rock, where he reveals to him that he murdered Mufasa. Enraged, Simba pins Scar to the ground and forces him to reveal the truth to the rest of the pride. Timon, Pumbaa, Rafiki, Zazu, and the lionesses fend off the hyenas while Scar, attempting to escape, is cornered by Simba at the top of Pride Rock. Scar begs for mercy and attempts to blame the hyenas for his actions; Simba spares his life, but orders him to leave the Pride Lands forever. Scar attacks his nephew, but Simba manages to toss him from the top of the rock. Scar survives the fall, but is attacked and killed by the hyenas, who overheard his attempt to betray them. Afterwards, Simba takes over the kingship as rain begins to fall.Later, with Pride Rock restored to its usual state, Rafiki presents Simba and Nalas newborn cub to the assembled animals, continuing the circle of life.",45000000,"[{""id"": 10751, ""name"": ""Family""}, {""id"": 16, ""name"": ""Animation""}, {""id"": 18, ""name"": ""Drama""}]",http://movies.disney.com/the-lion-king,8587,"[{""id"": 2143, ""name"": ""loss of parents""}, {""id"": 5276, ""name"": ""wild boar""}, {""id"": 6464, ""name"": ""uncle""}, {""id"": 11326, ""name"": ""shaman""}, {""id"": 11436, ""name"": ""redemption""}, {""id"": 13084, ""name"": ""king""}, {""id"": 14767, ""name"": ""scar""}, {""id"": 18136, ""name"": ""hyena""}, {""id"": 18153, ""name"": ""meerkat""}]",en,A young lion cub named Simba can't wait to be king.

626,627,The Lone Ranger,2013,/wiki/The_Lone_Ranger_(2013_film),"In 1933, a boy named Will who idolizes the legendary Lone Ranger encounters the elderly Comanche Tonto in a sideshow at a San Francisco fair. Tonto proceeds to recount his experiences with that Old West adventurer.In 1869, lawyer John Reid returns home to Colby, Texas, via the uncompleted Transcontinental Railroad, managed by railroad tycoon Latham Cole. Unknown to Reid, the train is also carrying Tonto and outlaw Butch Cavendish, who is being transported for his hanging after being captured by Dan Reid, Johns Texas Ranger brother. Cavendishs gang rescues Butch and derails the train. Tonto is subsequently jailed. Dan deputizes John as a Texas Ranger, and with six others they go after the Cavendish gang.Cavendishs men ambush and kill their pursuers. Cavendish slays Dan with his dagger and devours his heart as revenge for his imprisonment. Tonto, who has escaped from jail, comes across the dead men and buries them. However, a white spirit horse awakens John as a ""spirit walker"", and Tonto explains John cannot be killed in battle. Tonto also tells him Collins, one of the Rangers, betrayed Dan and is working with Cavendish. As John is thought to be dead, he wears a mask to protect his identity from enemies. Tonto gives John a silver bullet made from the fallen Rangers badges and tells him to use it on Cavendish, whom he believes to be a mystical beast called a wendigo.At a brothel Collins recently visited, Red Harrington informs the two about Dan and Collins fight over a cursed silver rock. Meanwhile, Cavendishs men, disguised as Comanches, raid frontier settlements. John and Tonto arrive after raiders abduct Dans widow and son, Rebecca and Danny. Regretting his earlier actions, Collins attempts to help the mother and child escape, but is shot dead by Cole, who rescues them. Claiming the raiders are hostile Comanches, Cole announces the continued construction of the railroad and dispatches US Cavalry Captain Jay Fuller to wipe out the Comanches.A Comanche tribe captures John and Tonto after the pair finds railroad tracks in Native territory. The leader tells John of Tontos past: As a boy, Tonto had rescued Cavendish and another man from near-death and later showed them a mountain full of silver ore in exchange for a pocket watch. The men murdered the tribe to keep the location a secret, leaving Tonto with great guilt which led to him believing the two were wendigos.Tonto and John escape as the cavalry attack the Comanche. At the silver mine, the duo captures Cavendish. Tonto demands John use the silver bullet to kill Cavendish, but John refuses. Upon returning Cavendish to Cole and Fullers custody, Cole is revealed to be Cavendishs partner and brother. Fuller, fearful of being labeled a war criminal for slaughtering the tribe, sides with Cole. Rebecca is held hostage, and John is returned to the mine to be executed. Tonto rescues him and the two flee. Realizing Cole is too powerful to be taken down lawfully and regretful since his arrogance in ignoring Tonto led to the mass slaughter of the Comanches and the kidnapping of his loved ones, John dons the mask again.At Promontory Summit, during the railroads union ceremony, Cole reveals his true plan: to take control of the railroad company and use the mined silver to gain more power. John and Tonto steal nitroglycerin and use it to destroy a railroad bridge. With Reds help, Tonto steals the train with the silver, and Cole, Cavendish and Fuller pursue him in a second train on which Rebecca and Dan Jr. are being held captive. On horseback, John pursues both trains. After a furious chase and fights on both trains, Cavendish and Fuller are killed, Rebecca and Dan Jr. are rescued, and Cole drowns while being buried beneath the silver ore after the train plunges off the severed bridge and into the river below, killing him.The town recognize John as a hero and offers him a law-enforcement position. John declines, and he and Tonto ride off. Back in 1933, Will questions the truth of the story.

627,628,The Lords of Salem,2013,/wiki/The_Lords_of_Salem_(film),"In Salem, Massachusetts, Heidi (Sheri Moon Zombie), a recovering drug addict, works as a DJ at a hard rock station with her co-workers Whitey (Jeff Daniel Phillips) and Herman (Ken Foree). She receives a strange wooden box containing an album by a band named The Lords. At her home, a downtown apartment house, she and Whitey listen to the record, which is a series of string and woodwind instruments playing several notes, then repeating itself. Heidi has a vision of women who worship Satan, at an unspecified time in the past, ritually birthing a baby then damning the child. The vision stops once Whitey turns the record off.The next day, Heidi interviews Francis Matthias (Bruce Davison), who has written a book about the Salem witch trials. The station then plays the Lords record, which causes all of the women in Salem (other than Heidi) to enter a trance. After the show is over, Matthias tells his wife (María Conchita Alonso) that the bands name, The Lords, bothers him. That night, Heidis landlord, Lacy (Judy Geeson), insists that Heidi split a bottle of wine with her and her sisters, Sonny (Dee Wallace) and Megan (Patricia Quinn). Megan, a palm reader, tells Heidi that she is fated to succumb to her dark sexual desires: ""the only reason you exist"". Disturbed, Heidi leaves the party. Later, Heidi notices her dog is acting strangely. She enters the supposedly vacant Apartment 5 and experiences visions of a demon and a nude witch that demands that she ""bleed us a king"". Heidi wakes up in bed and assumes the events in Apartment 5 were a vivid nightmare.Troubled, Heidi visits a church and falls asleep, dreaming that she is sexually assaulted by the priest present. Heidi flees the church but is faced with a ghostly entity who tells her that he has been waiting for her. Meanwhile, Matthias researches the Lords. He discovers some music in a book and, after asking his wife to play the notes on their piano, confirms that it is the same music heard on the record. Matthias tracks down the author, who tells him that in the seventeenth century one Reverend Hawthorne (Andrew Prine) accused a coven of Satan worshippers of creating the music to control the women of Salem. As a result, Hawthorne had the women executed, but not before their leader, Margaret Morgan (Meg Foster), put a curse on both the Salem women and Hawthornes descendants, calling his bloodline ""the vessel by which the devils child would inherit the earth"". Further research demonstrates that Heidi is a descendant of Reverend Hawthorne.Heidis radio station announces they will be giving away tickets to the upcoming Lords of Salem concert (though this concert never eventuates on-screen). The record is played once again, which causes Heidi to have more strange visions that disturb her. Upset, she spends the night at Whiteys home, but experiences more disturbing visions before waking up in her own apartment. Heidi begins using drugs again. While she is under the influence of drugs, Lacy, Sonny, and Megan take Heidi to Apartment 5. Inside, there appears to be a huge opera house with a demon seated on a throne at the top of a staircase. She approaches him as he screams and embraces her with tentacle-like appendages, but later she finds her way back to her bedroom.The next day, Matthias tries to tell Heidi the truth about the Lords and her lineage. Instead, Lacy and her sisters kill him. Heidi hears his murder taking place, but does nothing. Later at the concert, Heidi joins Lacy, Sonny, Megan, and the ghosts of Margaret and her coven in a satanic ritual. The Lords music causes the female audience members to strip off their clothing. In the midst of surreal visions, Heidi blissfully gives birth to a strange creature which looks akin to a crawfish, atop the corpses of the naked audience members. The next day, Heidis station reports on a mass suicide at a rock concert, as well as the disappearance of Heidi.",1500000,"[{""id"": 27, ""name"": ""Horror""}, {""id"": 53, ""name"": ""Thriller""}]",http://robzombie.com/movies/the-lords-of-salem/,104755,"[{""id"": 616, ""name"": ""witch""}, {""id"": 162806, ""name"": ""coven""}, {""id"": 181374, ""name"": ""salem massachusetts""}, {""id"": 181375, ""name"": ""satanic""}]",en,"The City of Salem, Massachusetts is visited by a coven of ancient witches.",14.504326,"[{""name"": ""Alliance Films"", ""id"": 2514}, {""name"": ""Blumhouse Productions"", ""id"": 3172}, {""name"": ""IM Global"", ""id"": 7437}, {""name"": ""Automatik Entertainment"", ""id"": 7625}, {""name"": ""Haunted Movies"", ""id"": 21742}]","[{""iso_3166_1"": ""CA"", ""name"": ""Canada""}, {""iso_3166_1"": ""US"", ""name"": ""United States of America""}, {""iso_3166_1"": ""GB"", ""name"": ""United Kingdom""}]",9/10/2012,1165882,101,"[{""iso_639_1"": ""en"", ""name"": ""English""}]",Released,We've been waiting... we've always been waiting,The Lords of Salem,5.1,242,0.162528932,0.5,0.277723849,0.5,-0.222276151,0.222276151,-0.337471068,0.260674457,0.777254667
628,629,The Losers,2010,/wiki/The_Losers_(film),"The Losers are an elite black ops team of United States Special Forces operatives, led by Clay (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) and formed by Roque (Idris Elba), Pooch (Columbus Short), Jensen (Chris Evans), and Cougar (Óscar Jaenada), who are sent to Bolivia in a search and destroy mission on a compound run by a drug lord. While painting a target for an upcoming air strike, the Losers spot slave children in the compound and try to call off the attack, but their superior, codenamed ""Max"" (Jason Patric), ignores their pleas.With no other option, the Losers enter the compound, successfully rescue the children and kill the drug lord in the process. As a helicopter arrives to pick them up, Max, convinced that they know too much, orders it to be destroyed, unaware that they decided to rescue the children first. The Losers watch as a missile destroys the helicopter and kills 25 innocents. Knowing that the attack was meant to kill them, they fake their deaths and become stranded in Bolivia, determined to get revenge on the mysterious Max.Four months later, Clay is approached by Aisha (Zoe Saldana), a mysterious woman who offers him the chance to kill Max, against whom she wants revenge. Clay accepts and Aisha arranges for the Losers to return to the United States, where they proceed to attack a convoy supposedly carrying Max, only to discover that they were tricked by Aisha into stealing a hard drive with Maxs secrets.Unable to access the files, Jensen infiltrates the company that made the drive and steals an algorithm that allows him to crack the code, discovering that the drive contains credits for a $400 million transfer in Maxs name, which he received for selling ""Snukes""—eco-friendly bombs with the potency of a nuclear warhead, but no fall-out—to international terrorists. Tracing the money flow to the Los Angeles International Port Of Entry, which the Losers deduce is Maxs base, a plan is formed to attack it and kill Max.While studying the drive, Jensen discovers that their mission in Bolivia was a cover so Max could eliminate the drug lord—who had discovered his plan—and that Aisha is the mans daughter, seeking revenge for his death. After her cover is blown, Aisha shoots Jensen and escapes. Believing that she might betray them, the Losers decide to speed up their attack on Maxs base, only to be betrayed by Roque and captured by Max and his right-hand man and chief of security, Wade (Holt McCallany).As the Losers are lined up to be executed, Aisha returns and ambushes Maxs team. In the ensuing fight, Clay confirms that he killed Aishas father. Roque attempts to steal Maxs plane, loaded with his money, and tries to escape. As Roques jet heads down the runway, Wade takes a motorcycle and goes after him to retrieve Maxs money. Cougar shoots the motorcycles engine, causing Wade to be hurled into the jets engine and the flaming motorcycle to be hurled into the cockpit of the plane, which explodes, killing Roque.As Jensen, Cougar and Aisha help Pooch, who has been shot in both legs by one of Maxs security guards, Clay pursues Max to a crane, where Max says that he has activated a Snuke that will destroy Los Angeles, and Clay will have to choose between de-activating it or killing Max. Clay chooses the former and Max escapes, but Clay affirms that he now knows what Max looks like and will soon find him.Max escapes on a bus and is robbed by two thugs.

629,630,The Lost Medallion: The Adventures of Billy Stone,2013,/wiki/The_Lost_Medallion:_The_Adventures_of_Billy_Stone,"The movie begins as Daniel Anderson (Alex Kendrick) arrives at a foster home, bringing donations. He is asked to tell a story to the children. He accepts and the movie transitions into the Lost Medallion universe.The story begins in a flashback in which a man holding an item wrapped in cloth is running away from another man. The man digs a hole by a tree and buries a medallion. The movie flashes back to the present where Billy (Billy Unger) sneaks into his fathers archaeology site and tries to help work. He is told to leave, so he goes swimming with his best friend Allie (Sammi Hanratty). When he goes back home, she gives him an old book.  Billy is not a reader, so they read it together. They hear how the medallion was buried in a different spot than where his dad is looking. They go into the forest with Billys home-made metal detector go searching. Two men from a rival archeology company have been watching them and bring their own metal detectors. The kids stumble on the goons and head off in a different direction. They hide behind a large tree. The detector goes off and they dig up the medallion.The goons discover them and chase them through the city. After a bit, the kids, thinking they have lost the men, head back to Billys home, only to find that the goons have arrived before them and tied up Billys dad. Billy yells ""I wish this whole mess had never happened!"" and the medallion sends both Billy and Allie back in time (200 years).The pair are captured and taken to a nearby village, where the village king (Jansen Panettiere), Huko, notices the medallion and claims that it is his. However, the people say that the king of the village is whoever wears the medallion; they hold a party for the new royalty.  The party is interrupted by the arrival of an enemy force, led by the ancestors of the two goons they had met in the present. Everyone in the village is captured except for Billy, Allie, Huko, and Anui.Later the group is cornered by a river. Allie is captured, but Billy agrees to exchange her for the medallion. After the exchange, the kids jump over a waterfall to avoid capture. The kids quarrel among themselves but decide to try and seek help from an old wise man, Faleaka (James Hong), in the mountains.The wise man tells them that they must complete tasks, and in return he will teach them how to defeat Cobra, the enemy that attacked the camp, and the evil warlord who keeps the natives in terror, and get the medallion back. The kids travel to the island of Cobra. On the beach of Cobras island, Faleaka is shot by an arrow and killed.The kids continue trying to get Cobra, but are captured; this time they are sent to a prison/work camp, and Billy is locked up in a cell. Billy escapes and meets the others in the camp. They use the tasks they learned from Faleaka to help everyone escape. Billy and Cobra have one last battle, and Cobra, along with the medallion, is pushed into a hellish pit.The four friends get back together, and Billy and Allie accept that they are stuck in the past permanently, since the medallion is gone forever. However, Billy realizes that since they are in the past, he and Allie do not find the medallion for another 200 years. Thus, the medallion should still be buried. He goes to the place where he and Allie had discovered the medallion, and finds the medallion there, wrapped up. The jewel that belongs in the middle starts glowing, and is put in its rightful place in the medallion. Billy gives the medallion to Huko, who then activates the medallion to send Billy and Allie back to the present. Billy attacks the goons that had captured his father, only to have his father stop him, revealing that time has changed and the goons are no longer evil.

630,631,The Martian,2015,/wiki/The_Martian_(film),"In 2035, the crew of the Ares III mission to Mars is exploring Acidalia Planitia on Martian solar day (sol) 18 of their 31-sol expedition.  A strong dust storm threatens to topple their Mars Ascent Vehicle (MAV), forcing them to abort their mission. During the evacuation, astronaut Mark Watney is struck by debris and lost in the storm, and telemetry from his suits biomonitor stops. With Watney believed dead, the storm worsening by the second, and the MAV on the verge of toppling, mission commander Melissa Lewis orders the crew to take off and return to their orbiting vessel, the Hermes.Watney awakens after the storm to a low-oxygen warning and returns to the crews surface habitat (""Hab""). Doing self-surgery, he removes from his abdomen the debris that destroyed his biomonitor. He begins a video diary. Lacking communications with Earth, his only chance of rescue is via the next Mars mission, four years later: the Ares IV, landing 3,200 kilometers (2,000 mi) away at the Schiaparelli crater. Watneys immediate concern is food; being a botanist, he improvises a farm inside the Hab utilizing Martian soil fertilized with human feces, water produced by extracting hydrogen from leftover rocket fuel, and potatoes intended for Thanksgiving dinner. He also begins to modify the only functional rover for longer journeys in preparation for the long-distance travel.After NASA holds a funeral for Watney, satellite planner Mindy Park reviews images of the Hab area and realizes he has survived. NASA administrator Teddy Sanders has the news released, but despite the objections of the Hermes flight director Mitch Henderson, decides not to ""distract"" the Ares III crew by informing them.Watney takes the rover to retrieve the nearby Pathfinder probe, which fell silent in 1997. Using Pathfinders camera and its motor, he establishes rudimentary two-way communication with Earth, first using simple signs, and then sending and receiving ASCII in hexadecimal. NASA sends a software patch to link the rover with Pathfinder and communicate via text. Watney becomes angry when he learns that the crew has not been told of his survival, and Sanders reluctantly lets Henderson finally inform them.Henderson and Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) director Bruce Ng prepare an Iris space probe to deliver enough food to last Watney until Ares IVs arrival. Meanwhile the Habs airlock malfunctions due to a small puncture, destroying Watneys crops. Sanders orders the team to skip the usual safety inspections to launch the probe sooner, but it fails 40 seconds after liftoff. Watney now feels his death is inevitable.The China National Space Administration has been developing a powerful classified booster rocket, the Taiyang Shen. Feeling camaraderie with NASAs scientists, they violate their governments secrecy and offer it to repeat the Iris mission. As Watney is still at more risk the longer he waits, JPL astrodynamicist Rich Purnell devises an alternative plan: send the Taiyang Shen with supplies to the Hermes, which will use Earths gravity to ""slingshot"" back to Mars two years earlier. Sanders rejects the idea, refusing to risk the crew on Hermes, but Henderson surreptitiously sends them Purnells plan. Risking their lives and careers, they vote unanimously for it, and make the necessary course change. Powerless to stop them, NASA concedes the issue.Watney begins the 90-sol journey to Schiaparelli, where the MAV for Ares IV has been pre-positioned, but it needs to be lightened to make the rendezvous with Hermes on its new course. Watney must remove many components,  and replace the nose cone with a piece of the Habs canvas. The MAV still fails to reach the required speed, so Commander Lewis maneuvers Hermes, consuming most of its available fuel, then ordering a directional explosive decompression of the internal atmosphere. Finally she uses a Manned Maneuvering Unit, but still cannot quite reach Watney. He pierces the glove of his pressure suit and uses the escaping air to propel himself towards Lewis, effectively reuniting him with his crew after 560 sols alone on Mars.After returning to Earth, Watney becomes a survival instructor for astronaut candidates.

631,632,The Maze Runner,2014,/wiki/The_Maze_Runner_(film),"A teenager wakes up inside an underground elevator with no memory of his identity. A group of male youths greet him in a large grassy area called the ""Glade"" enclosed by tall stone walls. The boys (""Gladers"") have formed a rudimentary society, with each assuming specialized tasks. Their leader, Alby, says that every boy eventually recalls his name but not his past. The boy learns that a vast Maze surrounding them is the only way out. During the day, designated Runners search the Maze for an escape route, returning before nightfall when the entrance closes. No one has ever survived a night in the Maze.While in a competition with another boy named Gally, the boy suddenly remembers his name: Thomas. The next day, he is attacked by Ben, a Runner who has been stung and left delirious by a Griever – deadly techno-organic creatures that roam the Maze at night. Ben is forced into the Maze and left to die, as there is no cure for his condition. Alby and Minho, the lead Runner, later retrace Bens steps inside the Maze. Minho reappears at dusk dragging Alby, who is stung, but they are unable to reach the closing entrance in time. Thomas runs into the Maze to help, leaving all three trapped. Thomas lures a Griever into a closing passageway, causing it to be crushed. The trio manages to survive the night, returning the next morning.The first-ever girl arrives in the elevator, with a note saying that she is the last one to enter the Glade. She recognizes Thomas, though he cannot remember her. Thomas, Minho, Frypan, Winston, and Zart enter the Maze, locate the Griever corpse, and remove a beeping mechanical device from inside it. Gally claims Thomas has jeopardized the fragile peace between the youths and the Grievers and wants him punished, but Newt, the groups second-in-command, instead designates Thomas as a Runner. Minho shows Thomas a hand-constructed model of the Maze based on previous exploration. The Mazes numbered sections open and close in a regular sequence. Thomas realizes that the device corresponds to a section within the Maze.The girl, Teresa, has two syringes filled with an unknown substance. One is used on Alby, and he recovers from the Griever sting. Minho and Thomas venture back into the Maze with the device and discover a possible exit. A laser then scans the two, and the exit closes. Thomas and Minho start to run away as traps activated by lasers nearly kill them. That night, the Maze entrance does not close while others open, letting Grievers pour in. A massacre ensues as the Gladers struggle to fight back or hide. Alby, Zart, Clint, and several others are killed.Afterwards, Gally punches Thomas and blames him for everything that happened. Thomas, who has been having disconnected memory flashes since arriving, stabs himself with a severed Griever stinger in an attempt to revive his memory. The others inject him with the last anti-venom. Unconscious, he recalls that he and Teresa worked for the organization that created the Maze, W.C.K.D.; the boys unknowingly have been test subjects for an experiment. Thomas awakens and shares this information with Newt, Minho, Chuck, and Teresa. Thomas then reveals himself and Teresa, confessing that they worked with W.C.K.D. and studied the boys for years.Meanwhile, Gally has taken command and intends to sacrifice Thomas and Teresa to the Grievers to restore peace. However, several Gladers form a group and free them. They then approach the Maze in an attempt to find an escape, while Gally and a few others refuse to leave. Fighting Grievers as they go, Jeff and several other Gladers are killed. The Gladers eventually enter a laboratory strewn with corpses. In a video recording, a woman named Ava Paige explains that the planet has been devastated by a massive solar flare, followed by a pandemic of a deadly virus called the Flare. The teens learn that they were part of an experiment studying for a cure. Paige is seen shooting herself on the screen as the lab is attacked by armed men.Gally suddenly appears with a gun. Having been stung by a Griever, he insists they must stay in the Maze and aims at Thomas, but is pierced through the chest by Minhos spear, but not before Chuck is fatally shot. Masked armed men then rush in and take the rest of the group to a helicopter. It flies over a vast desert wasteland and approaches a ruined city. The scene ends with the supposedly-dead scientists meeting in a room. Paige notes that the experiment is successful; the survivors are now entering Phase Two.",34000000,"[{""id"": 28, ""name"": ""Action""}, {""id"": 9648, ""name"": ""Mystery""}, {""id"": 878, ""name"": ""Science Fiction""}, {""id"": 53, ""name"": ""Thriller""}]",http://themazerunnermovie.com/,198663,"[{""id"": 818, ""name"": ""based on novel""}, {""id"": 2158, ""name"": ""maze""}, {""id"": 4458, ""name"": ""post-apocalyptic""}, {""id"": 4565, ""name"": ""dystopia""}, {""id"": 10685, ""name"": ""escape""}, {""id"": 11469, ""name"": ""memory loss""}, {""id"": 15261, ""name"": ""erased memory""}, {""id"": 18029, ""name"": ""trapped""}, {""id"": 162988, ""name"": ""dystopic future""}, {""id"": 204967, ""name"": ""runner""}, {""id"": 223438, ""name"": ""based on young adult novel""}]",en,"Set in a post-apocalyptic world, young Thomas is deposited in a community of boys after his memory is erased, soon learning they're all trapped in a maze that will require him to join forces with fellow ""runners"" for a shot at escape.",131.815575,"[{""name"": ""Ingenious Media"", ""id"": 290}, {""name"": ""Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation"", ""id"": 306}, {""name"": ""Gotham Group"", ""id"": 3672}, {""name"": ""Dayday Films"", ""id"": 8569}, {""name"": ""Temple Hill Entertainment"", ""id"": 12292}, {""name"": ""TSG Entertainment"", ""id"": 22213}]","[{""iso_3166_1"": ""US"", ""name"": ""United States of America""}]",9/10/2014,348319861,113,"[{""iso_639_1"": ""en"", ""name"": ""English""}]",Released,Run - Remember - Survive,The Maze Runner,7,5371,0.09169361,0.147825807,0.5,0.5,0,-0.352174193,-0.056132197,0.13610213,10.24470179
632,633,The Mechanic,2011,/wiki/The_Mechanic_(2011_film),"Arthur Bishop, working as a ""mechanic"" (mafia slang for hitman), sneaks into the lavish home of a Colombian drug cartel leader and drowns him in his own pool. Upon returning home to Louisiana, he meets with his friend and mentor Harry McKenna, who pays Bishop for his work.Bishop is given a new assignment:  kill Harry.  Bishops employer confirms by phone that the contract is correct, whereupon Bishop requests a face-to-face meeting.  Dean tells him about a failed mission in South Africa, in which agency assassins were killed. Dean says that only he and Harry knew the details of the mission, and that Harry had been paid for the contract details.  Reluctantly, Bishop kills Harry with the latters own gun and makes it look like a carjacking. At the funeral, Bishop meets Harrys reckless son Steve.  Bishop stops Steve from trying to kill a would-be carjacker in a misguided attempt at cathartic vengeance. Steve convinces Bishop to train him as a mechanic. Adopting a chihuahua, he instructs Steve to take the dog with him to a coffee shop each day at the same time.  As Steve settles into a routine, Bishop escalates training, taking him to observe a contract killing.The target is Burke, a mechanic for another agency who frequents the same coffee shop.  Burkes only weaknesses are his interests in young men and small dogs.  Burke makes a move on Steve and invites him out for drinks.  Bishop instructs Steve to slip a large dose of Rohypnol into Burkes drink to cause an overdose.  Steve ignores the instructions and goes with Burke to his apartment.  When Burke begins to undress, Steve attempts to strangle him with a belt as he had seen Bishop do on a former assignment.  Burke fights back, using his size advantage and experience, but Steve manages to kill Burke after much effort and a lengthy fight.  Dean expresses his disapproval of Bishops having involved Steve, which violated the rules of the contract arrangement, but Bishop says that Harry and his arrangement were for price only, and Harry had left the details up to Bishop.Bishops next contract is to kill cult leader Andrew Vaughn.  They plan to inject their victim with adrenaline to simulate a heart attack, for which the paramedics would administer a fatal dose of epinephrine.  While Bishop and Steve are preparing for the hit, Vaughns doctor arrives, and he sets Vaughn up with an IV of ketamine, which will inhibit the adrenalines effects.  The hit men decide to suffocate him instead, but are discovered after killing Vaughn and are forced into a shootout with the guards, after which the hit men slip away and fly home separately.At the airport, Bishop sees a supposed victim of the mission that Harry allegedly sold out. He confronts the other mechanic, who tells Bishop that he was paid by Dean to kill the other mechanics in South Africa and fake his death, so that Dean could engineer the failed mission to cover up his own shady dealings. He also reveals that Dean framed Harry and tricked Bishop into killing his friend. The mechanic then attempts to kill Bishop. After a struggle between the two professionals, Bishop ends up killing him. Bishop is later ambushed by Deans unprofessional henchmen: after killing them, he discovers that Dean was behind the hit. Bishop goes home to call Steve, only to find that Steve has been ambushed.  Bishop directs Steve to a hidden gun, which Steve uses to kill his attackers.  Steve gathers supplies for their new mission while Bishop plots how to get to Dean.  In the process, Steve finds his fathers gun and realizes that Bishop killed Harry.Bishop and Steve kill Dean in an ambush. On the way back, Bishop notices Steve carrying Harrys gun. When they stop for gas, Steve floods the ground with fuel while pretending to fill the tank.  He walks a safe distance away and shoots the gas, blowing up the truck with Bishop still inside. Steve returns to the house and performs two actions that Bishop told him not to do: playing a record on the turntable and taking the 1966 Jaguar E-Type. As he is driving away, Steve finds a note on the passenger seat that reads: ""Steve, if youre reading this, then youre dead!"", which he laughs off as a joke before the car explodes, killing him.

633,634,The Monuments Men,2014,/wiki/The_Monuments_Men,"In 1943, the Allies are making good progress driving back the Axis powers in Italy. Frank Stokes persuades President Roosevelt that victory will have little meaning if the artistic treasures of Western civilization are lost. Stokes is directed to assemble an Army unit nicknamed the ""Monuments Men,"" comprising museum directors, curators, art historians, and an architect, to both guide Allied units and search for stolen art to return it to its rightful owners.In July 1944, Claire Simone, a curator in occupied France, is forced to assist Nazi officer Viktor Stahl in overseeing the theft of art for either Adolf Hitlers Führermuseum or as personal property of senior commanders such as Hermann Göring. All seems lost when she discovers that Stahl is taking all of her gallerys contents to Germany as the Allies approach Paris. Simone runs to the railyard to confront him, but can only watch as he departs aboard the train carrying the cargo.Stokes unit finds its work frustrated by Allied officers in the field, who refuse to endanger their own troops for the sake of his mission. James Granger finds that Simone will not cooperate with those whom she suspects want to confiscate the stolen art for their own country. The unit splits up to cover more ground, with varying degrees of success. British officer Donald Jeffries sneaks into occupied Bruges at night to save Michelangelos Madonna of Bruges, but is killed in the attempt.Richard Campbell and Preston Savitz learn that Van Eycks Ghent Altarpiece was removed by the priests of Ghent Cathedral for safekeeping, but their truck was stopped and the panels taken. Eventually, they find and arrest Viktor Stahl, who is hiding as a farmer, when they identify the paintings in his house as masterpieces, at least one stolen from the Rothschild Collection.In December 1944, Walter Garfield and Jean Claude Clermont get lost in the countryside and blunder into a firefight. Clermont is mortally wounded and dies when Garfield is unable to find medical help. Meanwhile, Simone reconsiders when Granger shows her the Nero Decree, which orders the destruction of all German possessions if Hitler dies or Germany falls, and sees him return a painting looted from a Jewish family to its rightful place in their empty home. She provides a comprehensive ledger she has compiled that provides valuable information on the stolen art and the rightful owners.Even as the team learns that the artwork is being stored in various mines and castles, it also learns that it must now compete against the Soviet Union, which is seizing artwork as war reparations. Meanwhile, Colonel Wegner is systematically destroying whole art caches. Eventually, the team has some success, as it discovers at least one mine hiding over 16,000 art pieces. In addition, the team captures the entire gold reserves of the Nazi German national treasury.Finally, the team finds a mine in Austria that appears to have been demolished. However, they discover that the entrances were blocked by the locals to prevent the Nazis from destroying the contents. The team evacuates as much artwork as possible, including the sculpture Jeffries died trying to defend, before the Soviets arrive.As the war comes to an end in May 1945, Stokes reports back to President Truman that the team has recovered vast quantities of artwork and various other culturally significant items. As he requests to stay in Europe to oversee further searching and restoration, Truman asks Stokes if his efforts were worth the lives of the men he lost. Stokes says they were. Truman then asks if, thirty years from then, anyone will remember that these men died for a piece of art.

634,635,The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones,2013,/wiki/The_Mortal_Instruments:_City_of_Bones,"New York City teenager Clary Fray begins seeing a strange symbol, worrying her mother Jocelyn Fray and her mothers friend Luke Garroway. Later, at a  nightclub with her friend, Simon Lewis, Clary is the only person who sees Jace Wayland killing a man, who he claims is a demon. Meanwhile, Jocelyn is abducted by two men, Emil Pangborn and Samuel Blackwell, but she is able to call Clary and warn her about someone named Valentine. Jocelyn drinks a potion putting her in a comatose state. Returning home, Clary finds her mother missing and is then attacked by a demon. Clary kills it, and then Jace appears. Jace explains that he and her mother Jocelyn are both Shadowhunters (also called Nephilim), half human half angel warriors that slay demons and rule over the downworlders. Clary has inherited her powers, including the ability to use runes.Madame Dorothea, the Frays neighbor and a witch, deduces that Pangborn and Blackwell seek the Mortal Cup, one of the three Mortal Instruments given to the first Shadowhunter by the Angel Raziel. It allows normal humans to become half-Angel Shadowhunters. Simon, now able to see Jace, arrives and they go to Lukes bookstore. Pangborn and Blackwell are interrogating Luke there, who claims he cares nothing for Jocelyn and only wants the Mortal Cup.  The trio escapes to the Shadowhunters hideout, the Institute, where Clary and Simon meet two other Shadowhunters Alec and Isabelle Lightwood, and their leader, Hodge Starkweather. He reveals that Valentine Morgenstern, an ex-Shadowhunter who betrayed the Nephilim, now seeks the Mortal Cup to control both Shadowhunters and demons.Hodge instructs Jace to take Clary to the City of Bones so the Silent Brothers can probe Clarys mind for the Mortal Cups location. The Brothers uncover a connection to Magnus Bane, the High Warlock of Brooklyn. Bane says Jocelyn had him block the Shadowhunter world from Clarys mind. Vampires then kidnap Simon from Magnus party for downworlders. Clary, Jace, Alec, and Isabelle trail them to their hideout and rescue him but are outnumbered. Werewolves (that share a truce with the Shadowhunters) intervene and save them. These are led by Luke.At the Institute, Clary shares a romantic evening with Jace, ending in a kiss. When Simon confronts Clary about it, she downplays the incident, angering Jace. Simon confesses to Clary that he is in love with her, leaving her feeling guilty because she does not reciprocate his feelings.Clary realizes the Mortal Cup is hidden inside one of Madame Dorotheas tarot cards that were painted by her mother. The group goes to Dorotheas apartment but she has been replaced by a demon sent to steal the Cup. Simon and Jace kill it, but Alec is critically wounded. Clary retrieves the Mortal Cup and they return to the institute.Clary gives the Mortal Cup to Hodge who betrays them by summoning Valentine Morgenstern and giving him the cup. Valentine reveals he is Clarys father and wants her to join him. She escapes through a portal that transports her to Lukes bookstore. Luke, revealed to be a werewolf, confirms that Valentine is her father, and says Clary had an older brother named Jonathan who was killed. Luke and his werewolf pack return to the Institute with Clary to fight Valentine, who has summoned an army of demons through a portal he created. Simon and Isabelle close the portal with help from a repentant Hodge, who sacrifices himself. Meanwhile, Magnus Bane arrives and heals Alec.Clary and Jace fight Valentine, who claims both are his children eventhough Jace is not. They refuse to join him and, following a battle, Clary pushes him through the portal after giving him a fake Mortal Cup. The portal is destroyed, and Jocelyn is rescued, but she remains in a coma at the hospital. Clary tells Simon that someday someone will love him.

Now adults, Gary plans a vacation to Los Angeles with his girlfriend, Mary, to celebrate their tenth anniversary, inviting Walter so he can tour the Muppet Studios. Mary feels Garys devotion to Walter is distracting from their relationship.In Los Angeles, the three visit the abandoned Muppet Studios. During the tour, Walter sneaks into Kermits office and discovers Statler and Waldorf selling the Muppet Theater to oil magnate Tex Richman and his henchmen Bobo the Bear and Uncle Deadly. After Statler and Waldorf leave, Walter overhears Richman reveal his plan to destroy the theater and drill for oil underneath. Walter explains to Gary and Mary that if the Muppets can raise $10 million by the time their original contract expires, they can repurchase the theater.Agreeing to stop Richman, they find Kermit and inform him he must organize a telethon to raise the money, which appears difficult since the Muppets have gone their separate ways since the show ended its run. Convinced to try, Kermit sets off with the three to reunite the group. Kermit attempts to dissuade Fozzie from continuing to perform in Reno, Nevada with the Moopets, a tribute group of uncouth Muppet impersonators. Meanwhile, Gonzo has become a plumbing magnate and, despite his initial objection, destroys his business and joins them. Animal is recovered from a celebrity anger-management clinic, before being instructed by his sponsor Jack Black to keep away from drums. The other primary Muppets rejoin through a montage. Later in Paris, the group finds Miss Piggy working as an editor for ""plus-sized"" fashion at Vogue Paris. Having failed to convince Miss Piggy to return, the group replaces her with Moopet counterpart Miss Poogy.The Muppets return to Los Angeles and rebuild the theater while dancing to ""We Built This City"". They pitch their telethon idea to several television networks, but are rejected. Following a shows cancellation, CDE executive Veronica gives the Muppets a recently vacated two-hour slot in the networks schedule, on the condition that they find a celebrity guest. However, the Muppets first rehearsal is unsuccessful and Kermit is unable to contact a celebrity guest. Piggy returns, forces Poogy out, and informs Kermit that she refuses to work with him. Kermit inspires Walter to find his talent and perform in the telethon. Meanwhile, Mary goes sightseeing alone.Kermit entreats Richman to return their studio. Richman declines and reveals that the Muppets will also lose their trademark names, which he plans to entitle to the Moopets. Piggy then enlists the remaining Muppets to kidnap Black as a celebrity guest. Meanwhile, after discovering that a devastated Mary has returned to Smalltown, Gary realizes that he must improve his relationship with Mary and follows her back home to reconcile. The telethon begins and gradually attracts a large audience, with the Muppets raising donations with support from celebrity callers and Jack Black serving unwillingly as host. During the show, Richman cuts the theaters power supply, but Gary and Mary return to Los Angeles and restore the power. Richman then attempts to destroy the theaters television transmitter, but a regretful Uncle Deadly stops Richman. Kermit and Miss Piggy finally reconcile and the Muppets perform ""Rainbow Connection"" as their final act.However, the telethon runs short as the $10 million has yet to be collected. Having found his talent, Walter performs a whistling act, which is unanimously praised by the audience. Refusing to lose, Richman disables the telephone lines and evicts the Muppets from the theater, after the latter fall short of their monetary goal.

Now adults, Gary plans a vacation to Los Angeles with his girlfriend, Mary, to celebrate their tenth anniversary, inviting Walter so he can tour the Muppet Studios. Mary feels Garys devotion to Walter is distracting from their relationship.In Los Angeles, the three visit the abandoned Muppet Studios. During the tour, Walter sneaks into Kermits office and discovers Statler and Waldorf selling the Muppet Theater to oil magnate Tex Richman and his henchmen Bobo the Bear and Uncle Deadly. After Statler and Waldorf leave, Walter overhears Richman reveal his plan to destroy the theater and drill for oil underneath. Walter explains to Gary and Mary that if the Muppets can raise $10 million by the time their original contract expires, they can repurchase the theater.Agreeing to stop Richman, they find Kermit and inform him he must organize a telethon to raise the money, which appears difficult since the Muppets have gone their separate ways since the show ended its run. Convinced to try, Kermit sets off with the three to reunite the group.

Meanwhile, Gonzo has become a plumbing magnate and, despite his initial objection, destroys his business and joins them.

Meanwhile, after discovering that a devastated Mary has returned to Smalltown, Gary realizes that he must improve his relationship with Mary and follows her back home to reconcile. The telethon begins and gradually attracts a large audience, with the Muppets raising donations with support from celebrity callers and Jack Black serving unwillingly as host. During the show, Richman cuts the theaters power supply, but Gary and Mary return to Los Angeles and restore the power. Richman then attempts to destroy the theaters television transmitter, but a regretful Uncle Deadly stops Richman. Kermit and Miss Piggy finally reconcile and the Muppets perform ""Rainbow Connection"" as their final act.However, the telethon runs short as the $10 million has yet to be collected. Having found his talent, Walter performs a whistling act, which is unanimously praised by the audience.

She meets photographer Dean, who does her first shoot, and makeup artist Ruby, who introduces fellow older models Sarah and Gigi. The three women are intrigued by Jesses natural beauty and curious about her sexual proclivities. Jesse feigns experience in the latter.Jesse is signed by Roberta Hoffman, the owner of a modelling agency, who tells her to pretend she is nineteen and refers her to a test shoot with notable photographer Jack McCarther. Jesse goes on a date with Dean, but keeps his advances at bay. She returns to her motel room to find it ransacked and occupied by a mountain lion.

He pays no attention to Sarah but is entranced by Jesse. A distraught Sarah asks her how it feels to be the one everyone admires. Jesse admits, ""Its everything.""

Dean arrives and treats Jesses wound.At Sarnos fashion show, Gigi tells Jesse about all the cosmetic surgery she has had done, and expresses disbelief that Jesse has not used casting couches to achieve success. As Jesse is closing the show, she sees a vision of the glowing triangle she saw before in her hallucination. After the show, a visibly-changed Jesse goes out with Dean to a bar. There, Sarno denigrates women who have cosmetic surgery, using a humiliated Gigi as an example. In contrast, he praises Jesses natural looks.

She wakes up in time to hear someone fidgeting with her door lock. She quickly turns the lock, but is left to listen as the intruder breaks into the next room and assaults the female occupant. Terrified, she calls Ruby, who tells her to come over. Ruby tries to initiate sex with her, but Jesse rejects her, revealing herself to be a virgin. Ruby draws a diagram on Jesses mirror and leaves for her second job as a makeup artist at a morgue, where she pleasures herself with a female corpse.Ruby returns home and finds Jesse now unabashed in her narcissism. Jesse is attacked by Gigi and Sarah. Ruby pushes Jesse into a huge empty swimming pool, breaking her leg. The three women approach her with knives.

She lies in Jesses unmarked grave as part of a ritual that culminates in her living room, where a torrent of blood gushes from her genitals.The next day, Sarah drives Gigi to one of Jacks photoshoots with another model named Annie. Jack wanders to the living room and is suddenly enthralled with Sarah and fires Annie on the spot. In the midst of the shoot, Gigi feels ill and leaves.

640,641,The Other Guys,2010,/wiki/The_Other_Guys,"Allen Gamble (Will Ferrell) and Terry ""Yankee Clipper"" Hoitz (Mark Wahlberg) are both detectives of the New York City Police Department (NYPD). Allen is a mild-mannered forensic accountant while Terry is a hot-tempered detective who has been partnered with Allen ever since he mistakenly shot Derek Jeter during the World Series. They receive no respect from the other officers, particularly detectives Martin (Rob Riggle) and Fosse (Damon Wayans, Jr.). All but Terry idolize cocky detectives Chris Danson (Dwayne Johnson) and P. K. Highsmith (Samuel L. Jackson), who are considered New York Citys best policemen even though they frequently cause millions of dollars in property damage catching petty criminals. During a pursuit, Danson and Highsmith leap to their deaths after misjudging their ability to survive a fall, which causes the precinct to wonder why they did it and who will take their place.Allen and Terry investigate a scaffolding permit violation by multi-billionaire Sir David Ershon (Steve Coogan) but wind up uncovering a much bigger plot by Ershon to cover his losses to his client Lendl Global. Lendl CEO Pamela Boardman (Anne Heche) hires a team of mercenaries led by Roger Wesley (Ray Stevenson) to make sure Ershon pays her back.During their investigation, Allen confides in Terry about how he ran a college dating service in his past, though he denies that he was ever a pimp. When they both get to Allens house, Terry develops a slight crush on Allens wife Sheila (Eva Mendes), while not believing she is truly with Allen because of her beauty. When they visit Allens ex-girlfriend, Christinith, to gain their police evidence, she and her husband wants him to have sex with her. When Sheila tells Allen that she is pregnant, he reverts back to his dark personality, which has her kick him out of their house. Meanwhile, Terry unsuccessfully attempts to reconnect with his ex-fiancée Francine (Lindsay Sloane), who had walked out on him due to his furious attitude.Their investigation comes to a halt when Ershons attorney, Don Beaman (Andy Buckley), learns of Ershons plan to cover his losses, leading Wesley to kill him and make it look like a suicide. Angered at their lack of progress, Capt. Gene Mauch (Michael Keaton) splits up Allen and Terry, sending Terry to traffic duty and Allen to beat patrol. Despite Terrys anger, Allen still works the case on his own.  After Allen learns that Danson and Highsmith died investigating a staged theft during which Wesley broke into an accounting firm next door, he finds credible evidence and earns his gun back from Mauch. Allen then convinces Terry to rejoin him. They meet Capt. Mauch at Bed Bath & Beyond, his second job, where the police captain admits he has been holding off on the case because Ershon has high-profile connections that could ruin him, and he allows them to finish the case off-the-books.They go to an investment meeting Ershon is having and realize that the $32 billion Ershon seeks is really coming from the NYPD pension fund. They escape with Ershon to his private apartment, and Ershon tells them that the money for the pension fund is already in his account, ready to be transferred. Later that night, Allen and Terry finally reconcile with their loved ones. Allen apologizes to Sheila with her mother as a secret communication system and so she welcomes her husband back in. Terry also apologizes to Francine for letting his anger rule his life.The next morning, they drive to the bank to stop the transfer, evading Wesleys team, groups of Chechen and Nigerian investors to whom Ershon owes money, and police officers who are told Allen and Terry have gone rogue. They reach the bank and halt the transfer. Wesley arrives, and as a delaying tactic, shoots both officers and Ershon in their arms. Mauch finally arrives with police backup, rescuing the two and arresting Ershon for his embezzlement, and Wesley for multiple counts of murder. Ershons arrest leads to a stock market crash and the subsequent federal bailout of Lendl Global. Terry marries Francine, and Allen reunites with his wife.

641,642,The Passion of the Christ,2016,/wiki/The_Passion_of_the_Christ,"In the late hours of the night at the forested garden of Gethsemane, Jesus Christ, at the height of his cause, prays while his disciples Peter, James, and John sleep. While he prays in seclusion, Satan appears to Jesus in a hooded ghost-like androgynous, albino form, and tempts him, stating, ""It is not right for one man to die for their (humanitys) sins."" Jesus sweat turns into blood and drips to the ground while a serpent emerges from Satans guise. Jesus hears his disciples call for him, and rebukes Satan by crushing the snakes head.Judas Iscariot, another of Jesus disciples, having received a bribe of thirty pieces of silver, leads a group of temple guards to the forest and betrays Jesus identity. As the guards arrest Jesus, a fight erupts wherein Peter draws his dagger and slashes the ear of Malchus, one of the guards and a servant of the high priest Caiaphas. Jesus heals Malchus injury while reprimanding Peter. As the disciples flee, the guards secure Jesus, and beat him during the journey to the Sanhedrin.John informs Mary, mother of Jesus and Mary Magdalene of the arrest, while Peter follows Jesus and his captors. Magdalene begs a passing Roman patrol to intervene but a temple guard assures them that she is unbalanced. Caiaphas holds trial over the objection of some of the other priests, who are expelled from the court. False accusations and witnesses are brought against him. When asked by Caiaphas whether he is the Son of God, Jesus replies, ""I am"". Caiaphas tears his robes in outrage and Jesus is condemned to death for blasphemy. Peter is confronted by the surrounding mob for being a follower of Jesus. After cursing at the mob during the third denial, Peter flees when he recalls Jesuss forewarning of his defense. A guilt-ridden Judas attempts to return the money he was paid in order to have Jesus freed, but is refused by the priests. Tormented by demons, he flees the city and hangs himself.Caiaphas brings Jesus before Pontius Pilate to be condemned to death, but at the urging of Pilates wife Claudia, who knows of Jesus status as a man of God, and after questioning Jesus and finding no fault, Pilate transfers him to the court of Herod Antipas, as Jesus is from Antipas ruling town of Nazareth, Galilee. After Jesus is found not guilty and returned, Pilate offers the crowd the choice of chastising Jesus or releasing him. He attempts to have Jesus freed by the peoples choice between Jesus and violent criminal Barabbas. The crowd demands Barabbas be freed and Jesus crucified. Attempting to appease the crowd, Pilate orders that Jesus simply be flogged. Jesus is scourged, abused, and mocked by the Roman guards. They take him to a barn where they place a crown of thorns on his head and tease him saying “Hail, king of the Jews”. A bruised Jesus is presented before Pilate, but Caiaphas, with the crowds verbal backing, continues demanding that Jesus be crucified and Barabbas released. Pilate washes his hands of the affair, and orders Jesus crucifixion. Satan observes Jesus sufferings with sadistic pleasure. As Jesus carries a heavy wooden cross along the Via Dolorosa to Calvary, a woman avoids the escort of soldiers and requests that Jesus wipe his face with her cloth, to which he consents. She offers Jesus a pot of water to drink but the guard hurls it away and dispels her. During the journey to Golgotha, Jesus is beaten by the guards until the unwilling Simon of Cyrene is forced into carrying the cross with him. At the end of their journey, with his mother Mary, Mary Magdalene, and others witnessing, Jesus is crucified. Hanging from the cross, Jesus prays to God asking forgiveness for the people who tormented him, and provides salvation to a criminal crucified beside him, for his strong faith and repentance. Succumbing to impending death, Jesus surrenders his spirit to the Father and dies.

644,645,The Perfect Host,2011,/wiki/The_Perfect_Host,"Fugitive John Taylor flees an initially unspecified crime, with a wounded foot. Flashbacks and news reports reveal he robbed a bank in collusion with his girlfriend Simone, who was a teller in the bank. He stops in a convenience store for some disinfectant, just moments before it is robbed; he manages to turn the tables on the robber, but she gets away with his wallet. The stores TV identifies John and his car, so he quickly ditches it, proceeding on foot into an expensive neighborhood. With a sob story about being mugged, he gains entry to the house of Warwick Wilson. John poses as a friend of one of Warwicks friends after he found a postcard in the mailbox outside from a woman named ""Julia"". Warwick is preparing a dinner party. John makes small talk and drinks red wine while trying to figure out his next move and how to keep his lies from being found out. When the radio news makes an announcement about John, he angrily shushes Warwick, revealing himself. John threatens to kill Warwick if he doesnt cooperate and forces him to call his guests to cancel. Suddenly, John keels over; the wine has been drugged, and Warwick is not the person he seems to be.When John bounces back, he finds himself tied to a chair, and the party is in full swing—but all the guests Warwick is interacting with are figments of Warwicks imagination. Warwick takes a Polaroid of John and reveals a scrapbook of his past dinner parties, each with a murder victim and a timeline of things Warwick is going to do to him. As the night wears on, John is further terrorized, drugged, and incapacitated, learning various things about Warwicks strange lifestyle. A neighbour of Warwick, a prying old lady (whom John also tried to trick into letting him into her house earlier) hears John moaning and goes over to investigate. Warwick is able to trick her into leaving, blaming a drunk dinner guest for the noise. Warwick cauterizes Johns wound with the fire poker after the neighbor leaves. John also discovers that Julia is yet another figment of Warwicks imagination when he sees Warwick writing a postcard to himself from Julia.Later, John and Warwick play chess, with the prize being Johns freedom; John, who is an excellent player, wins. Warwick lets John go as agreed, but taunts him before he can leave, calling him worthless and secondary. John takes the tantō (Japanese sword) on display in Warwicks living room and stabs him with it, but it proves to be a collapsible prop knife, and so Warwick knocks John out. When he once more regains consciousness, they are in Warwicks bathroom, John tied up in the tub, while Warwick has an encounter. In the daylight, he places a picture in his scrapbook in which he seemingly slit Johns throat.Johns body is left outside with the trash. He wakes up and discovers that most of his injuries are fake; Warwick is a master of movie makeup. L.A.P.D. Detective Morton (Nathaniel Parker) arrives at Warwicks door – Warwick is actually a police lieutenant, who is working on Johns robbery. Warwick hides the scrapbook, medicine and kimono, then alters his demeanor and even his voice. Meanwhile, John becomes suspicious of girlfriend Simone and discovers she made alternative travel arrangements out of Los Angeles that dont include him. Warwick and Detective Morton join another detective who are watching Simones apartment. John locates Simone in a parking garage, taking her switch car and the money, leaving her to be captured by the detectives. Warwick stops John from leaving and blackmails him for the money, leaving him about $20,000 to get past the Mexican border, for which John says thank you.A couple of months later, Detective Morton receives a letter from Mexico – its a Polaroid of Warwick and John together, from the dinner party, with a written warning. A suspicious Morton confronts Warwick, who blows it off; but, when Morton persists, Warwick invites Morton to a dinner party and asks what type of wine he would like.

Clyde then travels to a Hasidic community in Brooklyn and learns from a Jewish priest named Tzadok (Matisyahu) which means Wise Man, that the possession has three main stages; in the third stage, the dybbuk latches onto its human host, becoming one entity with it. The only way to defeat the dybbuk is to lock it back inside the box via a forced ritual. Upon further examination on the box, Tzadok learns that the dybbuks name is ""Abyzou"", or the ""Taker of Children"".Em has a seizure and is taken to the hospital for an MRI. During the procedure, Stephanie and Hannah are horrified when they see the dybbuks face in the MRI scans next to Ems heart.

648,649,The Purge: Election Year,2016,/wiki/The_Purge:_Election_Year,"A young Charlene ""Charlie"" Roan and her family are tied up by a masked purger. He taunts them with his ""purge playlist"", and then tells them they will play a final purge game called ""Mommys Choice."" He then proceeds to kill the rest of Charlies family and leaves her as the only survivor of her family. Eighteen years later, Roan is a U.S. Senator campaigning for the U.S. Presidency, promising to end the annual purge nights. Former police sergeant Leo Barnes is now head of security for Roan. The New Founding Fathers of Americas (NFFA) leader, Caleb Warrens and their candidate, Minister Edwidge Owens, view Roan as a threat; in the guise of regaining the publics trust, revoke immunity for rank 10 or higher government officials to kill her on Purge night.Watching the presidential debate are deli owner Joe Dixon, his assistant Marcos, and former purger turned EMT Laney Rucker. A pair of teenage girls enters the store and shoplifts, only to be cornered by Joe. The girls mock Joe until Laney intervenes; recognizing her as a famous ex-Purger, they leave peacefully. Joe receives a phone call stating the cost of his purge insurance has increased beyond his affordability. Joe decides to guard his store himself, despite Marcos and Laneys pleas not to. At the same time, the countrys so-called ""Murder tourism"" booms the economy due to tourists visiting the United States to participate in the annual Purge nights.On the night of the purge, Joe guards his store and is joined by Marcos, and together they manage to repel an attack by the teenage girls. Laney and her partner Dawn patrol the city in an ambulance, providing medical care to the wounded. Roan decides to wait out the purge from her home rather than a secure location to secure the vote, and is accompanied by Barnes, Chief Couper, Eric, and additional security forces. However, a betrayal by Chief Couper and Eric allows a neo-Nazi paramilitary force led by Earl Danzinger to kill the security detail and invade the house. Barnes escorts Roan to safety, but is wounded in the process. He detonates a bomb in the house, killing Eric and Chief Couper.Navigating the hostile streets of Washington D.C., Barnes and Roan attempt to seek shelter, but are ambushed by a gang of Purgers and taken captive. Before they can be executed, Joe and Marcos kill the gang, having seen the pairs plight from the stores rooftop. As they take shelter in the store, the teenage girls return with reinforcements. However, Laney runs over their leader and kills half the group. As the other Purgers threaten to break in, they leave for a safer hideout. The team is ambushed by Danzinger in a helicopter, and seeks refuge beneath an overpass wherein Barnes realizes they were tracked by the bullet lodged inside him, and manages to extract it. After a confrontation with a large number of Crips, the team helps their leaders injured comrade. In return, the Crips plant the bullet in another area to divert the paramilitary team, which they later eliminate.The team arrives at an underground antipurge hideout run by Dante Bishop. Barnes discovers that Bishops group intends to assassinate the NFFA, in an effort to end the purge. A large group of paramilitary forces arrives at the hideout looking for Bishop. Barnes and Roan escape back to the streets and meet Joe, Marcos, and Laney, who had left the hideout earlier to return to Joes store. They board an ambulance.While fleeing the city, the ambulance is hit by Danzingers team. Roan is pulled from the van by the soldiers before Barnes can assist. Barnes leads the group and Bishops team to a fortified cathedral where the NFFA plans to sacrifice her. Before Roan can be killed by the NFFA, the group arrives and assassinates Warrens, causing a shootout that kills the entire congregation except Owens and another NFFA loyalist, Harmon James, who escape. Owens is caught by Bishops group, but Roan manages to persuade them to spare him. The remaining paramilitary forces arrive, killing Bishop and his team. Danzinger and Barnes engage in a melee which ends with the formers death. As Roan and the team free the imprisoned purge victims, James emerges and kills a released prisoner. Joe shoots him, but is fatally wounded. Before dying, Joe asks Marcos to take care of his store.Two months later, Roan wins the election in a landslide, while Barnes is appointed the new Director of the Secret Service. Marcos and Laney renovate Joes store, which had been looted and demolished by the surviving half of the teenage girls group, and continue to run it in his memory.

649,650,The Revenant,2015,/wiki/The_Revenant_(2015_film),"In late 1823, Hugh Glass guides Andrew Henry’s trappers through unorganized territory. While he and his half-Pawnee son, Hawk, are hunting, the companys camp is attacked by an Arikara war party. Guided by Glass, the survivors travel on foot to Fort Kiowa, as he believes traveling downriver will make them vulnerable. After docking, the crew stashes the pelts near the shore.While scouting game, Glass is badly mauled by a grizzly bear and left near death. Trapper John Fitzgerald, fearful of another Arikara attack, argues that the group must mercy-kill Glass and keep moving. Henry agrees, but is unable to pull the trigger; instead, he offers money for someone to stay with Glass and bury him after his death. When the only volunteers are Hawk and the young Jim Bridger, Fitzgerald agrees to stay for money, to recoup his losses from the abandoned pelts.After the others leave, Fitzgerald attempts to smother Glass but is discovered by Hawk. Fitzgerald, concerned that Hawks loud reaction to him attempting to kill Glass could alert the Arikara, stabs Hawk to death as Glass watches helplessly. The next morning, Fitzgerald convinces Bridger that the Arikara are approaching and they must abandon Glass. After they depart, Fitzgerald admits he lied. When Fitzgerald and Bridger meet Henry at the fort, Fitzgerald tells him that Glass died and Hawk vanished. In spite of his guilt, Bridger is complicit in the lie.Glass begins an arduous journey through the wilderness. He performs crude self-surgery and eludes the pursuing Arikara who are looking for the Chief Elk Dogs kidnapped daughter, Powaqa. Glass encounters Pawnee refugee Hikuc, who says that ""revenge is in the Creators hands."" The men share bison meat and travel together. After a hallucinogenic experience, Glass discovers Hikuc hanged by French hunters. He infiltrates their camp and sees the leader raping Powaqa. He frees her, kills two hunters, and recovers Hikucs horse, leaving his canteen behind. The next morning, Glass is ambushed by the Arikara and driven over a cliff on his horse. He survives the stormy night by eviscerating the horse and sheltering inside its carcass.A French survivor staggers into Fort Kiowa and Bridger recognizes his canteen as Glasss. Believing it stolen, Henry organizes a search party. Fitzgerald, realizing Glass is alive, empties the outpost’s safe and flees. The search party finds the exhausted Glass. Enraged, Henry orders Bridger arrested, but Glass vouches that Bridger was deceived and reveals that Fitzgerald murdered Hawk. Glass and Henry set out in pursuit of Fitzgerald.After the two split up, Fitzgerald ambushes and kills Henry. Glass uses Henrys corpse on his horse as a decoy and shoots Fitzgerald in the arm. He pursues Fitzgerald to a riverbank where they engage in a brutal fight. Glass is about to kill Fitzgerald, but spots a band of Arikara downstream. He remembers Hikucs words and pushes Fitzgerald downstream into the hands of the Arikara. Elk Dog kills and scalps Fitzgerald and the Arikara spare Glass.

650,651,The Rite,2011,/wiki/The_Rite_(2011_film),"Michael Kovak (Colin ODonoghue) is the son of a successful funeral home owner and businessman, Istvan (Rutger Hauer). Disillusioned with his past job as a mortician, Michael decides to enter a seminary school and renounce his vows upon completion, thereby getting a free college degree. Four years have passed, and Michael is being ordained to the rank of deacon at the seminary. After his ordination, he writes a letter of resignation to his superior, Father Matthew, citing a lack of faith. Father Matthew (Toby Jones), apparently wanting to talk to Michael, attempts to catch up to him on the street. He trips as he steps over a curb, causing a cyclist to swerve into the path of an oncoming van. The young cyclist, Sandra (Marija Karan), is critically injured. Seeing Michaels clerical garb, she asks him for absolution before her last breath. Initially hesitant, Michael is unable to refuse, comforting her and performing a blessing ritual to absolve her of her sins. Seeing how calmly Michael handled the situation, Father Matthew tells Michael that he is called to be a priest despite his resignation. He also tells Michael that with the rise in demonic possessions every year, the Church needs more exorcists and says that he has the potential to become one. Father Matthew decides to send him to the Vatican in Rome, so he can attend an exorcism class taught by his friend Father Xavier (Ciarán Hinds). Michael finally accepts after Father Matthew tells him that the Church might convert his scholarship into a student loan that would cost $100,000 if his immediate resignation stood. If Michael attends the exorcism class and still wants to resign afterwards, then they will discuss matters (hinting that he may be free to leave).During classes, he meets a young woman, Angelina (Alice Braga), who is also taking the course. He soon learns that she is a reporter who has been asked to cover the course for an article in a newspaper. Dominican Father Xavier, realizing Michael is a skeptic and very tentative in his faith, asks Michael to see a friend of his, a renowned Welsh Jesuit exorcist named Father Lucas (Anthony Hopkins). Michael agrees and meets Father Lucas at his home, where he also meets one of the priests patients: a pregnant sixteen-year-old girl named Rosaria. It is later revealed that she had been raped by her father, which led to her possession. However, Michael remains skeptical, even after witnessing several preternatural events, such as the girl coughing up three long nails, acting unnaturally, and speaking English fluently. She pointedly reminds Michael of the last patient he anointed and of his loathing for his own father. He later speaks again with Angelina, who asks him to relay any information he gets from Father Lucas to her, as she has tried for an interview with him many times but has been refused. Michael declines. Meanwhile, Rosarias condition worsens, to the extent that she tries to drown herself, prompting Father Lucas and Michael to have her hospitalized for further care. In the hospital, Father Lucas performs another exorcism on her while Michael observes. Still in doubt Michael leaves while Father Lucas stays overnight outside the girls room. Late that night, she miscarries; the baby dies from cardiac arrest, and the mother from blood loss from major hemorrhaging. Disheartened, Father Lucas feels he has failed her. When Michael sees this he decides to confer with Angelina.After the young womans death, Father Lucas begins behaving strangely, exhibiting signs of demonic possession, like slapping a child, looking confused, and restless. Michael and Angelina later find him sitting outside his house in the rain. Father Lucas takes them into his house and, knowing himself to be possessed, requests that Michael find Father Xavier to perform the exorcism. Angelina and Michael try desperately to contact and find Father Xavier; they learn, however, that he is out of contact for three days. Learning this, Michael decides to perform the exorcism himself, with Angelina present. After constant rebuking by the demon and a long, drawn-out fight, Michael regains his lost faith and is able to force the demon to reveal its name, Baal. He completes the exorcism, saying that he believes the demon and he believes God as well.The powerful demon leaves Father Lucas. Successful, Michael leaves Rome, returning to the United States and to his life.The final scene of the film shows Michael, now Father Michael Kovak, entering a confessional and beginning to hear a girls confession.",37000000,"[{""id"": 18, ""name"": ""Drama""}, {""id"": 53, ""name"": ""Thriller""}, {""id"": 27, ""name"": ""Horror""}]",http://whatdoyoubelieve.warnerbros.com/,48171,"[{""id"": 716, ""name"": ""vatican""}, {""id"": 8608, ""name"": ""violinist""}, {""id"": 11612, ""name"": ""hospital""}, {""id"": 17986, ""name"": ""miscarriage""}, {""id"": 159940, ""name"": ""exorcist""}, {""id"": 170577, ""name"": ""roman catholic""}, {""id"": 172232, ""name"": ""seminary""}, {""id"": 172240, ""name"": ""limp""}, {""id"": 172242, ""name"": ""toad""}, {""id"": 172246, ""name"": ""clergy""}, {""id"": 172248, ""name"": ""formalin""}, {""id"": 172251, ""name"": ""walking cane""}]",en,"Seminary student Michael Kovak (Colin O'Donoghue) reluctantly attends exorcism school at the Vatican.

She meets Tracy (Aly Michalka), Stephen (Cam Gigandet) – her love interest – and Rebecca (Leighton Meester), her college roommate. The girls begin to bond and Rebecca learns that Sara had an older sister, Emily, who died when Sara was nine, and an ex-boyfriend, Jason (Matt Lanter), who keeps calling her in attempts to reconcile. As time goes on, Rebeccas obsession with Sara grows, which causes her to drive away anyone who could come between them.Rebecca attacks Tracy in the shower, pinning her down and ripping out her belly-button ring, and says that she is a bad influence on Sara and threatens to kill Tracy unless she stays away from Sara. Tracy moves to another dorm, fearful of Rebecca. An old friend of Saras named Irene (Danneel Harris), invites Sara to move in with her when Saras cat Cuddles is discovered. Rebecca then kills Cuddles by putting her in the dryer and lies to Sara that the cat ran away. Rebecca then inflicts injuries upon herself and says she was assaulted by a thug. Sara feels bad for her and decides to spend the Thanksgiving with Rebecca. When Saras philandering fashion design professor, Roberts (Billy Zane), kisses her, Rebecca plans to get the professor out of the picture by seducing him while recording their dialogue on a tape recorder to make it sound like he was trying to rape her.During her stay, Sara overhears a conversation between Rebecca and her father (Tomas Arana), hinting Rebecca has had trouble making friends in the past. Rebeccas mother (Frances Fisher) mentions that Rebecca is supposed to be taking medication. She and Stephen later find a bottle of Zyprexa pills, used to treat schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. The bottle is full, implying that Rebecca has not been taking the pills. Sara decides to move in with Irene. Irene goes to a club where she sees Rebecca. They make out in the bathroom and Irene takes Rebecca back to her place. The following morning, Sara goes to Irenes apartment but she is not there.Rebecca gets Saras sisters name tattooed in the same place on her breast as Sara, saying that Sara can now think of Rebecca as her sister. Sara realizes that Rebecca is obsessed with her and packs all her things, except her sisters necklace, which she cannot find (the necklace having been stolen by Rebecca). Jason arrives at Saras dorm and slips a note under her door, saying that he wants to see her. Rebecca reads the note, impersonates Sara with her sisters necklace and tattoo, and dyes her hair to look like Sara. She goes to Jasons hotel room and stabs him to death.Sara gets a text from Irene, saying she needs Sara right away. She finds that Rebecca kidnapped Irene, and is holding her captive. Rebecca reveals that she was responsible for what happened to Tracy, Cuddles, Professor Roberts, and Jason and that she did it all to win Saras friendship.

652,653,The Secret Life of Pets,2016,/wiki/The_Secret_Life_of_Pets,"A Jack Russell Terrier named Max lives with his owner Katie in a Manhattan apartment. While she is at work during the day, he hangs out with other pets in the building: tabby cat Chloe, pug Mel, dachshund Buddy, and budgerigar Sweet Pea. One day, Katie adopts Duke, a large mongrel from the pound, leaving Max jealous because of her divided focus on Duke. Enraged by Maxs attitude towards him, Duke tries to abandon Max in an alley, but they are both attacked by cats led by Sphynx cat Ozone who removes both dogs collars and leaves them to be caught by Animal Control. Duke fears that he will be killed if he goes back to the pound. When Gidget, a white Pomeranian who is (not so) secretly in love with Max, discovers that he is missing, she decides to find him.Max and Duke are rescued by a white rabbit named Snowball, the leader of ""The Flushed Pets""—a gang of sewer-dwelling animals who hate humans because their owners mistreated them. After Max and Duke pretend to despise humans as much as they do by saying they killed their owners, the Flushed Pets invite them to join. Before they can prove their loyalty by allowing a one-fanged viper to bite them, Snowball learns from the cats that Max and Duke are domesticated. The two dogs escape the sewers and board a ferry to Brooklyn, inadvertently killing the viper in the process. Snowball vows to kill them and leads the Flushed Pets after them.Meanwhile, Gidget recruits a red-tailed hawk named Tiberius to find Max, but he mistakenly locates Ozone, whom Gidget coerces into telling what he knows about the dogs. They then enlist Mel, Buddy, Chloe, guinea pig Norman and Sweet Pea. On the way, they meet Pops, an old Basset Hound who helps Gidget and the pets find Max. Meanwhile, Max and Duke raid a sausage factory for food. Then, Gidget and her team encounter Snowball, who vows to kill them as well, and Norman is captured as the rest of Gidgets team flees.In the meantime, Duke tells Max about his previous owner, Fred, an elderly man who adopted him as a puppy and loved spending time with him. One day, Duke got lost while chasing a butterfly and was caught by Animal Control, but Fred never came to claim him. Max convinces him to visit Freds house in a nearby neighborhood, confident Fred will still love him and take him back. When they arrive at Freds house, they learn from the resident cat Reginald that Fred has died. Heartbroken, Duke accuses Max of attempting to get rid of him and barks at the new homeowners who have just returned to the house and called Animal Control. The handlers catch Max, but Duke interferes long enough for Max to escape and ends up being captured instead.While trying to rescue Duke as he follows the Animal Control van, Max is attacked by Snowball who tries to kill him. However, when his gang is captured, Snowball realizes that he and Max must work together to rescue them. They drive a city bus into the van on the Brooklyn Bridge, stopping traffic. The Flushed Pets encircle Max, unaware of his partnership with Snowball, but Gidget and her team save him. Upon seeing Gidget using her kung-fu fighting skills, Max starts to fall in love with her. The van gets stuck in scaffolding and the Flushed Pets escape. As soon as Max gets the keys to Dukes cage, the van plummets into the East River with him inside. Max is unable to free Duke, so Snowball jumps into the river to retrieve the keys, allowing them to escape the sinking van.The entire group returns to the apartment block by pig-driven taxi. Max expresses his love for Gidget, who returns his affection. Snowball and the Flushed Pets then come up with a new plan to annihilate all humans, but a little girl named Molly arrives and adopts Snowball and the remaining Flushed Pets return to the sewers. At first, Snowball resists, but gives in and lets himself become a domesticated pet.

653,654,The Shallows,2016,/wiki/The_Shallows_(film),"Shortly after the death of her mother, medical student Nancy Adams travels to a secluded beach in Baja California, the same beach her mother visited while she was pregnant with Nancy. Carlos, a friendly local resident, gives Nancy a ride and drops her off at the beach. Nancy joins two other locals and the three surf for several hours. Taking a break from surfing, Nancy video-chats with her sister Chloe. When she talks to her father in an emotional and strained conversation, it is revealed that her mothers death caused Nancy to consider dropping out of medical school.While surfing one last time for the day, Nancy notices the carcass of a large humpback whale nearby. As she rides the last wave back to the beach, a large great white shark knocks her off her surfboard and bites her leg. Nancy climbs onto the whale carcass, but the shark rams it from underneath, forcing her to swim to an isolated rock. She uses her surfboard strap to slow the bleeding from her leg. Later she uses her jewelry to put rudimentary stitches in place to hold her torn flesh together. Nancy is left alone when the unaware locals leave the beach, and she spends the night on the rock with a wounded seagull, which was also injured by the shark, and names him Steven Seagull. The next morning, a drunk local man on the beach steals Nancys belongings. While wading out into the shallow water to steal Nancys surfboard, however, he is killed by the shark. Several hours later, the two locals Nancy had surfed with the day before return. They get into the water before Nancy can warn them away, and are also killed by the shark.One of the local surfers was wearing a GoPro camera on his helmet. When he was attacked by the shark, his helmet had come off and floated to the surface. Nancy later sees the helmet floating in the water. After some struggle, she is able to retrieve it and notices in the footage of the attack, the shark has a large hook stuck in its mouth after a possible encounter with fishermen. Nancy uses the GoPro to leave messages for her sister and father as well as information about the shark attack and her location.With high tide approaching, Nancy realizes the rock will be submerged soon. After sending Steven Seagull toward shore on a piece of the surfboard, and timing the sharks circles from the whale carcass to the rock, Nancy swims to a nearby buoy, narrowly avoiding the shark by swimming through a group of jellyfish, which sting both the shark and her. Nancy finds a flare gun on the buoy. She shoots one flare to draw the attention of a faraway cargo ship, but the ship has already turned away and does not see her. She then fires another flare at the shark, setting the oil from the whale carcass alight and angering it, but otherwise having no effect. The shark then ferociously attacks the buoy and rips out the chains securing it to the ocean bed. Nancy straps herself to the last remaining chain and as it is ripped from the buoy, she is pulled down to the ocean floor, pursued by the shark. At the last moment, Nancy pulls out of the dive, and the shark impales itself on some rebar from the buoys anchor.Later, a boy named Miguel at the beach finds the action camera and informs his father, Carlos. Carlos finds Nancy floating close to shore and revives her. Nancy briefly sees a hallucination of her mother. As she looks around the beach, she sees that Steven Seagull has made it to the shore. One year later, a healed Nancy (now a doctor) and her sister Chloe go surfing in Galveston, Texas, as their father tells Nancy that her mother would have been proud.",17000000,"[{""id"": 27, ""name"": ""Horror""}, {""id"": 18, ""name"": ""Drama""}, {""id"": 53, ""name"": ""Thriller""}]",http://www.theshallows-movie.com,332567,"[{""id"": 534, ""name"": ""mexico""}, {""id"": 966, ""name"": ""beach""}, {""id"": 1524, ""name"": ""surfer""}, {""id"": 2041, ""name"": ""island""}, {""id"": 10349, ""name"": ""survival""}, {""id"": 14712, ""name"": ""young woman""}, {""id"": 15097, ""name"": ""shark""}, {""id"": 15098, ""name"": ""great white shark""}, {""id"": 18029, ""name"": ""trapped""}, {""id"": 158130, ""name"": ""animal attack""}, {""id"": 223059, ""name"": ""animal horror""}, {""id"": 228752, ""name"": ""prey""}]",en,"An injured surfer stranded on a buoy needs to get back to shore, but the great white shark stalking her might have other ideas.",60.829621,"[{""name"": ""Columbia Pictures"", ""id"": 5}, {""name"": ""Ombra Films"", ""id"": 23513}, {""name"": ""Weimaraner Republic Pictures"", ""id"": 67069}]","[{""iso_3166_1"": ""US"", ""name"": ""United States of America""}]",6/24/2016,119100758,86,"[{""iso_639_1"": ""en"", ""name"": ""English""}]",Released,What was once in the deep is now in the shallows.,The Shallows,6.2,1567,0.280102283,0.5,0.5,0.5,0,0,-0.219897717,0.073299239,7.005926941
654,655,The Signal,2014,/wiki/The_Signal_(2014_film),"Three MIT students – Jonah, Nic, and Haley – are on a road trip to move Haley to California, a decision that stresses Nics relationship with her. Haley feels Nic is distancing himself from her and Nic explains he does not want his disability to hold her back (Nic walks with forearm crutches, and the possibility of  muscular dystrophy, multiple sclerosis, or some other degenerative disease is implied but never specified). During their stay in a hotel, Nic and Jonah discover that a hacker named NOMAD, who nearly got them expelled for breaking into MIT servers, has found their location and is taunting them with strange and ominous emails. They track NOMAD to an abandoned house in the middle of Nevada and decide to go after him. After finding nothing in the house, Nic and Jonah hear Haley scream and run outside, only to see her pulled into the sky before disappearing into a white light themselves.Nic, now with the number 2.3.5.41 tattooed on his arm, wakes up in a strange and sterile underground research facility where he is questioned by Dr. Wallace Damon, the head of the ""transition group"" in charge of helping Nic to cope with his strange situation. Damon tells Nic what they encountered near the house was an EBE: an extraterrestrial biological entity. Nic remains in a state of disbelief. Dr. Damon then shows him footage from Nics own video camera and pauses where an alien face can be seen peering from behind a tree. Nic is taken to his room where he hears Jonah talking to him through a small vent in the wall, saying ""(his) body feels weird."" Nic also notices that his legs, previously weak but functional, are now completely numb. When Dr. Damon questions him again, Nic tries to get answers about Haleys condition (she is in a coma at the time), but is unsuccessful. Following an unexplained experiment on a cow in another part of the facility, a security alarm goes off and Nic, along with other personnel, finds large dents with scorch marks running across the walls and no sign of Jonah. Nic asks Damon where Jonah went but Damon tells him that Jonah was never recovered from the house. Increasingly agitated, Nic tries to break Haley out but is intercepted. After being restrained, he is shocked to discover that his legs have been amputated and replaced by prostheses made from alien technology. Nic then uses these super-powered limbs to break Haley and himself out of the facility, only to discover they are in the middle of a vast barren desert.After hitching a ride with an old lady who seems sweet yet oddly troubled, Nic and Haley hijack an 18-wheeler truck to try to find a way around the seemingly endless canyon that extends around the facility and surrounding area. At a visitors center, they come across Jonah disguised as one of the facility workers dressed in a white hazmat suit. Jonah reveals that he too had limbs taken from him, as his forearms and hands have been replaced with the same alien technology as Nics legs. Jonah speculates that they are in Area 51 and that this is all a test. After Nic discovers indications of alien technology also implanted in Haleys spine, the trio drive up to a military checkpoint where Jonah tries to hack into their systems, only to be stopped by a hail of gunfire from the facility personnel. Nic and Jonah hug as the fatally wounded Jonah prepares for his final stand that will allow Nic and Haley to escape. Jonah uses his remaining strength and prosthetic alien arms to subdue the group of soldiers. However, Nic and Haleys escape is short-lived; as they approach the only bridge that would take them over the canyon to the outside world, they run into Damon and his military men, who blow out the trucks tires. Haley is evacuated by helicopter beyond the canyon and, knowing that Nic has mastered use of his legs, Damon tells Nic ""you cant reach her."" After hearing a loud horn coming from the sky, Nic realizes that Damon is NOMAD. Damon then explains that it was Nic who came looking for him, that this was his fault, and adding that Nic is ""the perfect integration of human will and alien technology. Our finest achievement."" Agitated and emotionally compromised, Nics bionic legs enable him to sprint at supersonic speed across the bridge in the direction of Haleys chopper, where he hits an invisible barrier and breaks through.Nic finds himself inside what appears to be a different facility behind a projected image of the outside world beyond the canyon. Turning back toward the bridge, he sees Damon remove his helmet to reveal that he is actually a robotic alien. Nic walks towards a window and realizes he is not in a facility, but is on an immense alien spacecraft numbered 2.3.5.41 (matching the numerical tattoo on his arm) that is about to dock at their home-world (signaled by the horn).",4000000,"[{""id"": 53, ""name"": ""Thriller""}, {""id"": 878, ""name"": ""Science Fiction""}]",https://www.facebook.com/thesignalfilm,242095,"[{""id"": 2157, ""name"": ""hacker""}, {""id"": 4769, ""name"": ""supernatural powers""}, {""id"": 7312, ""name"": ""road trip""}, {""id"": 10183, ""name"": ""independent film""}, {""id"": 33637, ""name"": ""superpower""}, {""id"": 188987, ""name"": ""boyfriend girlfriend relationship""}, {""id"": 207011, ""name"": ""secret laboratory""}]",en,"Three college students on a road trip across the Southwest experience a detour – the tracking of a computer genius who has already hacked into MIT and exposed security faults.

Not wanting this vision to come true, Papa Smurf disallows Clumsy to pick Smurf Roots. Clumsy disobeys Papa and ends up unintentionally leading Gargamel and Azrael to the village. The Smurfs all flee for their lives while Clumsy unknowingly runs towards the Forbidden Falls, with Papa Smurf, Smurfette, Grouchy, Brainy and Gutsy running after him. They find him at the edge of a cliff, and while trying to help him up, they are sucked into a gigantic vortex that spirits them to present day New York City. To make matters worse, Gargamel and Azrael follow them through the vortex.

657,658,The Smurfs 2,2013,/wiki/The_Smurfs_2,"In preparation for her birthday celebration, the Smurfs read the story of Smurfette, how she was created by Gargamel to destroy them, only for Papa Smurf to rescue her and turn her fully into a Smurf. Meanwhile, she is having nightmares about reverting to her original form and betraying her fellow Smurfs by turning them over to Gargamel. The Smurfs are preparing a surprise party, but as Smurfette tries to find out what her fellow Smurfs are planning, none of them are saying a word. She takes this to mean that everyone has forgotten her birthday.In France, Gargamel is now a celebrity, amazing people with his sorcery, but he sees that he is running low on the Smurf essence that gives him his magic powers. With his new creations, evil Smurf-like creatures called the Naughties, named Vexy and Hackus, Gargamel plans on opening a portal to the Smurf village by using the Eiffel Tower as a conduit so that he can kidnap Smurfette and, through her, get Papa Smurfs secret formula for creating Smurfs. However, as the portal he created is not big enough for him to go through, Gargamel sends Vexy through to the portal to grab Smurfette and bring her to Paris.The Smurfs witness the abduction of Smurfette and inform Papa Smurf, who uses his magic to create crystals that allow several of his Smurfs to travel directly to Patrick Winslows residence in New York City in order to get his help to rescue Smurfette. Papa originally intends for Brainy, Hefty, and Gutsy to use the crystals, but through an accident, Clumsy, Grouchy and Vanity use them  instead. Papa and the three Smurfs arrive in the apartment right after the celebration of Blues fourth birthday where they meet both the Winslows young boy and Patricks stepfather Victor Doyle, a man who is a constant embarrassment to Patrick. The Smurfs soon discover where Gargamel is, and so they and the Winslows set off for Paris in order to find him.After their arrival in Paris, Patrick and his wife Grace work together with Victor to distract Gargamel during one of his performances while the Smurfs sneak backstage in order to find Smurfette, only to discover what Gargamel is planning. At the same time, Smurfette escapes from her prison, and Vexy and Hackus chase after her. Upon her return to Gargamels hotel suite with the Naughties, Gargamel presents her with a tiny dragon wand as a feigned act of kindness. Smurfette still refuses to give Gargamel the formula until she sees that the Naughties are dying due to a lack of Smurf essence. Faced without an alternative to save them, Smurfette writes the formula down and Gargamel uses it to turn the Naughties into real Smurfs. Immediately after they become Smurfs, Gargamel puts them into his Smurf-a-lator so he can carry out the rest of his plan.Meanwhile, Patrick, Victor, and the Smurfs work together to rescue Smurfette. The Smurfs are soon captured and put into the Smurf-a-lator, powering Gargamels large-sized dragon wand. Patrick and Victor arrive just in time to destroy the Smurf-a-lator, causing the formula to be destroyed in blue pixie dust that in turn vanquishes the secret formula. Gargamel has gained enough power to use his new wand against the Smurfs and their allies. Vexy and Hackus team up with the Smurfs against their former master and use the new wand to blast him away. He then falls onto the Notre Dame Cathedral, where he accidentally brings a stone vulture to life, which then throws him to the top of the Eiffel Tower where fireworks then set off, sending him in the air. Vexy and Hackus bid farewell to the Winslows and return home with the rest of the Smurfs.In two post-credit sequences, Gargamel and Azrael are pulled into the portal, sending them back to their castle, and they later have a fight.",105000000,"[{""id"": 14, ""name"": ""Fantasy""}, {""id"": 10751, ""name"": ""Family""}, {""id"": 35, ""name"": ""Comedy""}, {""id"": 16, ""name"": ""Animation""}]",http://smurfhappens.com,77931,"[{""id"": 10244, ""name"": ""based on cartoon""}, {""id"": 10336, ""name"": ""animation""}, {""id"": 15072, ""name"": ""smurf""}]",en,"The evil wizard Gargamel creates a couple of mischievous Smurf-like creatures called the Naughties that he hopes will let him harness the all-powerful, magical Smurf-essence.

658,659,The Social Network,2010,/wiki/The_Social_Network,"In October 2003, 19-year-old Harvard University student Mark Zuckerberg is dumped by his girlfriend Erica Albright. Returning to his dorm, Zuckerberg writes an insulting entry about Albright on his LiveJournal blog and then creates a campus website called Facemash by hacking into college databases to steal photos of female students, then allowing site visitors to rate their attractiveness. After traffic to the site crashes parts of Harvards computer network, Zuckerberg is given six months of academic probation. However, Facemashs popularity attracts the attention of Harvard upperclassmen and twins Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss and their business partner Divya Narendra. The trio invites Zuckerberg to work on Harvard Connection, a social network featuring the exclusive nature of Harvard students and aimed at dating.After agreeing to work on the Winklevoss twins concept, Zuckerberg approaches his friend Eduardo Saverin with an idea for what he calls Thefacebook, an online social networking website that would be exclusive to Ivy League students. Saverin provides $1,000 in seed funding, allowing Mark to build the website, which quickly becomes popular. When they learn of Thefacebook, the Winklevoss twins and Narendra are incensed, believing that Zuckerberg stole their idea while keeping them deliberately in the dark by stalling on developing the Harvard Connection website. They raise their complaint with Harvard President Larry Summers, who is dismissive and sees no value in either disciplinary action or Thefacebook website itself.Saverin and Zuckerberg meet fellow student Christy Lee, who asks them to ""Facebook me"", a phrase which impresses both of them. As Thefacebook grows in popularity, Zuckerberg extends the network to Yale University, Columbia University and Stanford University. Lee arranges for Saverin and Zuckerberg to meet Napster co-founder Sean Parker, who presents a ""billion-dollar"" vision for the company that impresses Zuckerberg. He also suggests dropping ""The"" from Thefacebook, just calling it Facebook. At Parkers suggestion, the company moves to Palo Alto, with Saverin remaining in New York to work on business development. After Parker promises to expand Facebook to two continents, Zuckerberg invites him to live at the house he is using as company headquarters.While competing in the Henley Royal Regatta for Harvard against the Hollandia Roeiclub, the Winklevoss twins discover that Facebook has expanded to Oxford, Cambridge and LSE, and decide to sue the company for theft of intellectual property. Meanwhile, Saverin objects to Parker making business decisions for Facebook and freezes the companys bank account in the resulting dispute. He later relents when Zuckerberg reveals that they have secured $500,000 from angel investor Peter Thiel. However, Saverin becomes enraged when he discovers that the new investment deal allows his share of Facebook to be diluted from 34% to 0.03%, while maintaining the ownership percentage of all other parties. He confronts Zuckerberg and Parker, and Saverin vows to sue Zuckerberg for all the companys shares before being ejected from the building. Subsequently, Saverins name is removed from the masthead as co-founder. Later, a cocaine possession incident involving Parker and his attempt to place the blame on Saverin finally convinces Zuckerberg to cut ties with him.Throughout the film, the narrative is intercut with scenes from depositions taken in the Winklevoss twins and Saverins respective lawsuits against Zuckerberg and Facebook. The Winklevoss twins claim that Zuckerberg stole their idea, while Saverin claims his shares of Facebook were unfairly diluted when the company was incorporated. At the end, Marylin Delpy, a junior lawyer for the defense, informs Zuckerberg that they will settle with Saverin, since the sordid details of Facebooks founding and Zuckerbergs own callous attitude will make him highly unsympathetic to a jury. After everyone leaves, Zuckerberg is shown sending a friend request to Albright on Facebook and then refreshing the webpage every few seconds as he waits for her response.The epilogue states that Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss received a settlement of $65 million, signed a non-disclosure agreement, and rowed in the 2008 Beijing Olympics, placing sixth; Eduardo Saverin received a settlement of an unknown amount and his name was restored to the Facebook masthead as a co-founder; the website has over 500 million members in 207 countries and is valued at $25 billion; and Mark Zuckerberg is the worlds youngest self-made billionaire.",40000000,"[{""id"": 18, ""name"": ""Drama""}]",http://www.thesocialnetwork-movie.com/,37799,"[{""id"": 2157, ""name"": ""hacker""}, {""id"": 12361, ""name"": ""hacking""}, {""id"": 162749, ""name"": ""creator""}, {""id"": 170209, ""name"": ""frat party""}, {""id"": 171063, ""name"": ""social network""}, {""id"": 171065, ""name"": ""deposition""}, {""id"": 171067, ""name"": ""intellectual property""}, {""id"": 171068, ""name"": ""entrepreneur""}, {""id"": 171070, ""name"": ""arrogance""}, {""id"": 220076, ""name"": ""young entrepreneur""}, {""id"": 220831, ""name"": ""facebook""}]",en,"On a fall night in 2003, Harvard undergrad and computer programming genius Mark Zuckerberg sits down at his computer and heatedly begins working on a new idea.

659,660,The Spectacular Now,2013,/wiki/The_Spectacular_Now,"Sutter Keely (Miles Teller) is a charming and popular 18-year-old who is partying and drinking his way through senior year in high school. When his girlfriend Cassidy Roy (Brie Larson) decides hes a lost cause and breaks up with him, she starts seeing Marcus (Dayo Okeniyi), the School President and an athletic star. Sutter goes home and writes a college application supplement, in which he says that his biggest hardship in life has been getting dumped by his girlfriend the day before. He then goes out and gets drunk.He wakes up on the front lawn of Aimee Finicky (Shailene Woodley), a girl in his year whose name he doesnt know. Aimee is about to do her mothers paper route, which she does every morning, though she gives most of the money to her mother to pay the bills, which Sutter protests at being unfair. Sutter does the paper route with her and they have a good time. He sits with her at lunch and asks her to tutor him in geometry, which he is failing, and learns she is smart, funny and into sci-fi and comics. Sutter goes home and deletes the supplement he wrote about his lifes biggest hardship, abandoning it for the time being. Sutter invites Aimee to a party, where he introduces her to some Sci-Fi fans and then asks Cassidy to have a drink with him, but Marcus arrives to pick her up. Sutter and Aimee go for a walk and get drunk from his hip flask. Aimee confesses she has never been drunk before, never had a boyfriend and doesnt think she can go to college because she has to take care of her irresponsible mother. Sutter tells her she is not responsible for her mother, she is beautiful, and the boys at the party liked her. Sutter then kisses her to further convince her of this.The next morning Sutter wakes up hungover and realizes that he asked Aimee to prom the night before. Avoiding his college application, Sutter IMs Cassidy, who invites him over. They get drunk in her room, reminisce and Sutter says hes happy with his life living in the moment. Cassidy say she needs more than a moment; she needs a future, which Sutter cant do. Marcus, who is jealous of the way Sutter and Cassidy have fun, confronts Sutter, who reassures him that Cassidy doesnt want him anymore, but perhaps Marcus could lighten up sometimes.Sutter has been avoiding Aimee and her friend Krystal (Kaitlyn Dever) warns him not to hurt her. Sutter takes Aimee to dinner at his sister Hollys (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), whos married a wealthy lawyer and become a housewife. At dinner Aimee talks frankly about the death of her father from an opiate overdose and her dreams of a perfect marriage. Sutter and Aimee become more serious. Aimee invites Sutter over to have sex. Afterwards Sutter confesses that his mother kicked his father out when he was a child and has forbidden him from seeing him, even though hed formerly lied and told her his father was an air force pilot. Sutter and Aimee make a pact to stand up to their mothers. Sutter buys Aimee a hip flask as a gift for prom, so they can drink together. Aimee is too shy to dance, so Sutter dances first with Cassidy and theyre the center of attention, but then he drags Aimee onto the dance floor for a slow dance. The night goes well and Aimee tells him that she is going to college in Philadelphia where her sister lives, and can help her find an apartment and job in a bookstore. She asks Sutter to come with her and go to junior college there.Sutter gets his fathers (Kyle Chandler) phone number from Holly and arranges to meet up to see a baseball game, like they used to, and takes Aimee along. His father has forgotten about their plans and instead takes them to a local bar, then ditches them when he picks up a woman at the bar. He asks them to get the tab and meet him back at his motel, but when he fails to show up they find him back in the bar drinking with his mates, so they head home. Aimee attempts to comfort Sutter by telling him she loves him, but Sutter, angry and drunk, snaps at her. After almost causing an accident, he tells her hes no good for her and forces her to get out of the car. Aimee, crying and not paying attention to the road, is clipped by a passing car. Aimee has only a broken arm and immediately forgives Sutter for the incident, despite the fact that he had never driven her while sober. Meanwhile, Sutter is failing geometry, as he has always been bad at it and no longer has Aimee to tutor him.At graduation, Sutter opens up his diploma and reveals that it is blank, implying that he failed senior year and did not technically graduate. After graduation, Sutter refuses to drink with Aimee from her flask. Cassidy informs Sutter that she is going to California with Marcus. He suggests he might pay a visit to them but Cassidy says its a bad idea and shes trying to do things that are healthy for her. She hugs him goodbye and tells him he will always be her favorite ex-boyfriend. His boss, Dan (Bob Odenkirk), tells him he has to let go of some staff. He wants to keep Sutter on, because he is great with the clients, but only if he stops turning up drunk. Sutter says he cant promise that and quits.Sutter then drives past Aimee, who is waiting for him by the bus to Philadelphia, leaving her heartbroken. He heads to a bar and explains to the barflies that it was for Aimees own good. He drives home drunk, totals his mailbox, and gets in an argument with his mother (Jennifer Jason Leigh). He says he saw his father and hes just like him. His mother says he isnt like his father at all because he has a kind heart. Sutter reassesses his life and finally completes the personal statement for his college application, even though he knows its way too late. He confesses that his biggest hardship is himself. Afraid of failure and getting hurt, he has tried to shut out everything and everybody, so while his life might not be ""harder than normal,"" he has made it so with his own actions. While living in the now is okay, there will be another ""now"" the next day, and he will make sure his ""nows"" add up to something. He drives to Philadelphia and finds Aimee as she is leaving class. He looks up at her hopefully.

660,661,The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water,2015,/wiki/The_SpongeBob_Movie:_Sponge_Out_of_Water,"A pirate named Burger Beard travels to Bikini Atoll, where he obtains a magical book with the power to make any text written upon it real. The book tells the story of SpongeBob SquarePants and his adventures in the underwater city of Bikini Bottom. SpongeBob loves his job as a fry cook at the Krusty Krab fast food restaurant, where he cooks hamburgers called Krabby Patties and works for Mr. Krabs, the Krusty Krab CEO. He has spent several years prudently protecting the secret Krabby Patty formula from Plankton, the owner of a competing restaurant called the Chum Bucket.One day, Plankton attacks the Krusty Krab in an attempt to steal the formula. After a military battle involving giant foods and condiments, Plankton feigns surrender and uses a decoy of himself to give Mr. Krabs a fake penny, which the real Plankton then hides inside in order to gain access to Krabs vault. As the decoy distracts Mr. Krabs, Plankton steals the formula, leaving a fake in its place. SpongeBob catches Plankton and the two engage in a tug of war over the formula, which magically disappears before anyone can claim it.Without the secret formula, Krabby Patties cannot be made, causing customers to become ravenous. SpongeBob is the only one who believes Plankton is innocent and creates a giant soap bubble for them to fly away in. Bikini Bottom is immediately reduced to an apocalyptic wasteland due to the absence of the much-relied-on Krabby Patty. A page of the book is discarded in the ocean and lands on Sandy Cheeks treedome, causing Sandy to assume the page is a sign from the ""sandwich gods"". SpongeBob proposes he and Plankton team up to find the formula. SpongeBob tries to explain the concept of teamwork to Plankton, who does not quite understand. Together, they travel back in time to the moment before the formula disappeared. The two then head to the Chum Bucket to rescue Karen, whom they intend to help power the time machine. They assemble the machine and end up traveling far into the future, where they meet Bubbles, a magical dolphin who acts as an overseer of the galaxy, and inadvertently get him fired. SpongeBob and Plankton succeed in retrieving the formula, but it turns out to be the fake one Plankton had left.Burger Beard converts his pirate ship into a food truck to sell Krabby Patties at a beach community. Sandy suggests a sacrifice be made to appease the gods. As the town attempts to sacrifice SpongeBob, he and Mr. Krabs smell Krabby Patties. The townsfolk follow the scent, which leads to the surface. Bubbles returns and, revealing that he hated his job, repays SpongeBob by granting him and his sea creature friends the ability to breathe on land; Plankton also joins by stowing away in SpongeBobs sock. Bubbles launches SpongeBob and the others out of his blowhole to the surface.The team lands on a beach and finds the source of the Krabby Patty scent from Burger Beards food truck. Burger Beard reveals he had stolen the formula by using the book to rewrite the story, and then uses it to banish the gang to Pelican Island. SpongeBob uses the page that Sandy had to transform himself and the others into superheroes with special powers—The Invincibubble (SpongeBob), Mr. Superawesomeness (Patrick), Sour Note (Squidward), The Rodent (Sandy), and Sir Pinch-a-Lot (Mr. Krabs)—but leave the page and Plankton behind. They return and find Burger Beard, who runs away with the formula, forcing the team to give chase. During the ensuing battle, the team manages to destroy the book, but Burger Beard overpowers them one by one.Plankton then appears as a muscle-bound hero named Plank-Ton and assists them. Plankton and SpongeBob create one final attack to defeat Burger Beard and retrieve the Krabby Patty formula. After sending Burger Beard flying to Bikini Atoll, Plankton returns the formula to Mr. Krabs, having learned the value of teamwork. The gang uses the final pages magic to return home to Bikini Bottom. With Krabby Patties back, the city is finally returned to normal and Plankton re-assumes his role as business rival and villain.In the epilogue, The seagulls ask Burger Beard to sing the opening theme song with them. He accepts, and they all start singing. But is interrupted by Bubbles, who dislikes the song, causing the seagulls to have an epic rap battle with him. The seagulls ask him to leave so that they can finish their song.

661,662,The Switch,2010,/wiki/The_Switch_(2010_film),"30-something Kassie Larson (Jennifer Aniston) is single, hasnt found love yet, and decides she wants to have a baby. Despite the objections of her neurotic long-time best friend Wally Mars (Jason Bateman), she chooses to do so alone because she cant wait any longer. She also wants a face-to-face sperm donor, disdaining using a sperm bank. Wally suggests he be the donor, but Kassie sees him as a bit too neurotic, pessimistic, and self-absorbed, and besides, as best friends, ""that would be weird."" Wally has always had feelings for Kassie, and they dated six years ago, but his friend Leonard (Jeff Goldblum) points out he missed his chance when she put him in the ""friend zone.""Kassie selects as sperm donor a handsome and charming (and married) assistant professor, Roland (Patrick Wilson). Kassie organizes an ""insemination party"", where Wally meets Roland and takes an instant dislike to him. Roland is then called upon and produces his sperm in the bathroom, leaving it in a sample cup. Wally uses the bathroom and sees the sample. Drunk and doped up after taking a pill provided him at the party by Kassies friend, Debbie (Juliette Lewis), and not liking the idea of Kassie being inseminated with this sperm, Wally plays with the cup and accidentally spills it into the sink. Panicking, he replaces the sperm with his own. The next day at work, still hungover, he remembers nothing. The insemination is successful. Wally is then upset when Kassie tells him she is returning to her family home in Minnesota, as she thinks that would be a better environment to raise a child in, instead of New York City. She leaves, and Wally maintains a non-fulfilling, dreary existence.Seven years later, Kassie returns to New York along with precocious-but-neurotic six-year-old son Sebastian (Thomas Robinson). She wants to reconnect with Wally, and is eager to introduce her son to him. After an awkward first meeting, Wally eventually forms a bond with this loveable and seemingly mini-version of himself, and Sebastian starts to become close to Wally, but the bad news is that Roland is in the picture too: Kassie has started dating him because he is now divorced and, as she thinks he is Sebastians father, and a nice guy, maybe it would work.After Wally notices the similarities between himself and Sebastian, and after talking to his friend Leonard, Wally realizes what happened seven years earlier. Just before Roland proposes to Kassie, Wally reveals to Kassie that Sebastian is his son, along with his true feelings for her. She is shocked and angry and does not want to see him again. Some time passes, and one day, as he is leaving work, Wally finds Kassie waiting for him on the street outside his office building. She tells him Sebastian really misses him and needs him. Wally admits he misses and needs Sebastian too. Kassie then discloses she isnt with Roland any longer, and that she loves him, even with all of his idiosyncrasies. Wally proposes to her, Kassie accepts, and they kiss.

662,663,The Thing,2011,/wiki/The_Thing_(2011_film),"In the winter of 1982, a buried alien spacecraft is discovered in Antarctica by Lars, Peder and Olav, members of a Norwegian research station, ""Thule"". American paleontologist Kate Lloyd is recruited by Dr. Sander Halvorson and his assistant Adam Finch to investigate. They fly to Thule in an American helicopter operated by Carter, a pilot, Jameson, his co-pilot, and Griggs, a crewman. The scientists are met by station chief Edvard, Juliette, and Karl. After seeing the spacecraft, the scientists examine an alien body buried in the ice nearby, and make plans to excavate it.  That evening, the new arrivals meet the rest of the base: Jonas, Henrik, Colin, and Lars dog.The next day, the body is excavated in a block of ice, which gradually melts in storage. In the evening, Jameson sees the alien burst from the ice. The team search for the creature, finding Lars dog dead. The creature is found; it kills Henrik by dragging him into itself, spattering blood on Olav.  The group burn the creature, killing it. An autopsy finds a metal implant of Henriks outside of his body, and further that the creatures cells were copying Henriks. Olav falls ill.The next morning, the helicopter crew departs with Olav, for McMurdo. During takeoff, Kate discovers dental fillings near a bloodied shower. She runs outside to flag down the helicopter. When it attempts to land, Griggs transforms and attacks Olav. The helicopter spins out of control and crashes in the mountains. Kate finds the shower has been cleaned up and tells the team that the alien organism imitates its victims. Noting that Thules helicopter is away for refueling at Halley, Edvard orders the team to drive to the closest base. Juliette lures Kate into an abandoned room, transforming and attacking her. Kate escapes, but the Juliette-creature instead kills Karl. Lars arrives with a flamethrower and burns the Juliette-creature. The team resolve to quarantine themselves until the threat is eliminated, and discuss scientific tests.That night, Carter and Jameson improbably stagger back to the base, out of the cold. Suspecting them as creatures, the group isolate them. Thules laboratory is sabotaged, and tensions flare. Inspired by her earlier discovery, Kate proposes a simple test: everyone must open their mouths to check for dental fillings. The alien does not assimilate inorganic or metallic material, and so people with fillings are cleared. The test implicates Sander, Edvard, Adam, and Colin, who have no visible fillings. Lars and Jonas go to get Carter and Jameson for testing, and as Lars searches an outer building, he is suddenly pulled inside. Chaos erupts, and Carter and Jameson break into the main building, shooting Peder dead and puncturing his flamethrowers tank. The flamethrowers leaking fuel meets its active flame, causing an explosion which knocks Edvard unconscious. When brought to the main room, Edvard violently transforms, infects Jonas, kills Jameson, and gruesomely assimilates Adam.  The Edvard-creature drags Adams body away, now part of its own body.  Kate burns Jonas and Jameson before she and Carter pursue the creature, which assimilates Sander.  The Edvard-Adam-creature attacks Carter but is burned by Kate, saving him.An assimilated Sander drives off into the night, pursued by Kate and Carter. They arrive at the spacecraft which suddenly activates, separating them. Kate falls into the ship, confronting the Sander-creature. Kate kills it with a grenade and the explosion shuts down the ships engines. Kate and Carter reunite. Kate notices that Carter is missing an earring he wore earlier. When confronted, Carter points to the wrong ear. Kate burns the Carter-creature, which emits an alien scream, and she seeks warmth in a nearby snowcat.The next morning, Thules helicopter pilot Matias returns.

663,664,The Three Musketeers,2011,/wiki/The_Three_Musketeers_(2011_film),"In Venice, the musketeers Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, with the help of Milady de Winter, steal airship blueprints made by Leonardo da Vinci. However, they are betrayed by Milady, who incapacitates them and sells the blueprints to the Duke of Buckingham.A year later, dArtagnan leaves his village in Gascony for Paris in hopes of becoming a musketeer as his father was, only to learn that they were disbanded. At a rural bar, he challenges Captain Rochefort, leader of Cardinal Richelieus guard, to a duel after being offended by him, but Rochefort merely shoots him while hes distracted. Once in Paris, dArtagnan separately encounters Athos, Porthos and Aramis and, accidentally offending all three, schedules separate duels with each. Athos brings Porthos and Aramis to the duel as his seconds, causing dArtagnan to realize their true identities. Richelieus guards arrive to apprehend them, but, inspired by dArtagnan, the musketeers fight together and win. All four are summoned before the young King Louis XIII and Richelieu urges him to execute them, but Queen Anne is impressed by their bravery and the king condecorates them instead.Richelieu instructs Milady, now his accomplice, to plant false love letters among Queen Annes possessions, steal her diamond necklace, and take it to the Tower of London in order to frame her as having an affair with Buckingham, which would force King Louis to execute her and declare war on England. At this point, the people would demand a more experienced leader: Richelieu himself. In order to secure her own position, Milady demands that Richelieu declare in a written authorization that she is working on behalf of France.The false letters are found and given to King Louis, who is advised by Richelieu to set up a ball at which Queen Anne would be forced to wear the necklace. If she doesnt, then her affair is real, and there will be war. Queen Annes lady-in-waiting Constance Bonacieux discovers Richelieus plan and pleads with the musketeers to stop him. They follow Milady and Buckingham to London, while Constance is captured by Rochefort for helping the musketeers to escape from him.In London, Milady tells Buckingham the musketeers have arrived to take revenge on him and teaches him all their tendencies in battle. DArtagnan is captured, but turns out to be a decoy following the plan Milady would have expected the Musketeers to follow, allowing his associates to steal Buckinghams airship and rescue him. Miladys getaway coachman reveals himself as the musketeers manservant Planchet and delivers her to his masters, who retrieve the necklace from her. Athos prepares to execute Milady for her treachery, but she leaps off the airship, apparently dying on her own terms.The musketeers depart back to Paris, only to be intercepted by Rochefort in a much larger airship, for Milady had given Richelieu copies of da Vincis blueprints. Rochefort offers to exchange Constance for the necklace, but captures dArtagnan and mounts an assault as soon as he retrieves the jewels. His superior airship has the upper hand and severely damages the opposing vessel, but the musketeers use the clouds to rally and counterattack. The fight ends when both ships ram each other, crashing onto Notre Dame. On the roof, dArtagnan duels and ultimately kills Rochefort. Constance is sent ahead to quietly return the necklace to Queen Anne. The musketeers arrive at the ball and, for the sake of King Louis and his people, lie by claiming that Rochefort tried to sabotage an airship that Richelieu built for them, and that they executed him for his treason on Richelieus permission. To convince the king, Athos presents Miladys authorization, which the former accepts. Richelieu, satisfied, offers the musketeers a place in his guards, but they refuse, and Richelieu vows revenge.Meanwhile, Milady is found alive at the English Channel by Buckingham, who declares his intention to exact revenge. The camera then pulls back to show him advancing towards France with a massive fleet of battleships and airships.",75000000,"[{""id"": 12, ""name"": ""Adventure""}, {""id"": 28, ""name"": ""Action""}, {""id"": 53, ""name"": ""Thriller""}]",http://www.threemusketeers-movie.com/,52451,"[{""id"": 9791, ""name"": ""number in title""}, {""id"": 12995, ""name"": ""historical fiction""}, {""id"": 14577, ""name"": ""musketeer""}, {""id"": 207941, ""name"": ""17th century""}, {""id"": 209714, ""name"": ""3d""}]",en,The hot-headed young D'Artagnan along with three former legendary but now down on their luck Musketeers must unite and defeat a beautiful double agent and her villainous employer from seizing the French throne and engulfing Europe in war.,36.605246,"[{""name"": ""Impact Pictures"", ""id"": 248}, {""name"": ""Studio Babelsberg"", ""id"": 264}, {""name"": ""Nouvelles \u00c9ditions de Films (NEF)"", ""id"": 753}, {""name"": ""New Legacy"", ""id"": 939}, {""name"": ""Constantin Film Produktion"", ""id"": 5755}]","[{""iso_3166_1"": ""US"", ""name"": ""United States of America""}, {""iso_3166_1"": ""DE"", ""name"": ""Germany""}, {""iso_3166_1"": ""FR"", ""name"": ""France""}, {""iso_3166_1"": ""GB"", ""name"": ""United Kingdom""}]",8/31/2011,132274484,110,"[{""iso_639_1"": ""en"", ""name"": ""English""}]",Released,Every legend has a new beginning.,The Three Musketeers,5.6,924,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0,0,0,0,1.763659787

665,666,The Tourist,2010,/wiki/The_Tourist_(2010_film),"A British woman, Elise Clifton-Ward, is being followed by French police who are working with Scotland Yard under the direction of Inspector John Acheson. Acheson has spent years hunting Alexander Pearce, Elises husband, who owes £744 million in back taxes, and is believed to have received plastic surgery to alter his appearance. At a Parisian cafe, Elise receives written instructions from Pearce: Board the train to Venice, Italy; pick out a man; let the police believe that he is Pearce. Elise burns the note, evades the police and boards the train.On the train, Elise selects Frank Tupelo, who is apparently an American mathematics teacher from a community college in Wisconsin. Meanwhile, the police have managed to salvage the ashes of her burned note and assembled them to extract information regarding her rendezvous, as well as her ruse. Aware of her location, but not of the ruse, an informer from the police station communicates to Reginald Shaw, the mobster from whom Pearce stole $2.3 billion, that Pearce is traveling with Elise on the train to Venice. Shaw immediately proceeds to Venice.Elise invites Frank to stay with her at her suite in the Hotel Danieli in Venice. Pearce leaves further instructions for Elise to attend a ball. Elise abandons Frank, who is then chased by Shaws men. While trying to escape from them, Frank is detained by the Italian police, ostensibly for his own safety, only to have a corrupt inspector turn him over to Shaws men in exchange for the bounty that has been placed on Pearces head. Elise rescues Frank just before he is handed over, leading Shaws men on an extended boat chase and finally escaping. She leaves Frank at the airport with his passport and money, urging him to go home for his own safety.Elise is revealed to be an undercover Scotland Yard agent who was under suspension for her suspected sympathies with Pearce. She agrees to participate in a sting operation. At the ball, as Elise tries to spot Pearce in the crowd, an envelope is placed on the table in front of her, but the man disappears into the crowd. She tries to follow him through the crowd, but is stopped by Frank. Frank claims to be in love with Elise and invites her to dance with him. After the police surprise Frank, Elise reads the note. She leaves suddenly in her boat to be tailed by Shaw. Both parties are followed by the police. Frank is held handcuffed.When Elise arrives at the destination, Shaw takes her prisoner, threatening to harm her unless she reveals the location of the stolen money. The police monitor the situation inside the rendezvous room through audio and video links. Despite Elises peril, Acheson repeatedly turns down police requests to intervene with their snipers. While the police are occupied in monitoring the situation, Frank escapes from the police boat and confronts Shaw, claiming to be Pearce and offering to open the safe if Elise is allowed to leave safely. Shaw is skeptical and makes a counter offer that Frank should open the safe if he does not want to see Elise tortured by his men. Chief Inspector Jones arrives at the police stake-out, overrides Acheson, and orders the snipers to fire, killing Shaw and his men. To Elises obvious pleasure, Jones lifts her suspension and terminates her employment.Acheson, receiving a message that Pearce has been found near their position, rushes to find the police have detained an Englishman. The man, Lawrence Mason, says he is a tourist following written instructions received via his mobile phone, for which he has been receiving payments. Elise tells Frank that she loves him, but she also loves Pearce. Frank then suggests a ""solution"" to this dilemma; to Elises surprise, he opens the safe by entering the correct code, thus revealing that he is really Alexander Pearce. When the police open the safe they find only one cheque: It is for £744 million. Acheson prepares to chase after Pearce, but Jones overrides him, reasoning that with the taxes now paid in full, Pearces only crime is that he stole money from a now-dead gangster. Jones orders the case to be closed, much to Achesons frustration.

666,667,The Town,2010,/wiki/The_Town_(2010_film),"Four lifelong friends from the Boston neighborhood of Charlestown, Doug MacRay, James ""Jem"" Coughlin, Albert ""Gloansy"" MacGloan, and Desmond ""Dez"" Elden, rob a bank. They take the manager, Claire Keesey, hostage, but release her unharmed. When they find out Claire lives in their neighborhood, Doug begins to follow her to find out how much she has told the police, and to make sure that Jem does not eliminate her as a witness. Soon a romance grows between them, which Doug hides from the gang. As they grow closer, Doug tells Claire of his search for his long-lost mother, who he believes went to live with his aunt in Tangerine, Florida. He also recounts his chance to be a professional hockey player which he threw away for a life of crime, following in his fathers footsteps. She in turn tells Doug that she saw a tattoo on one of the robbers, and he realizes that she can identify Jem and send them all to jail. He knows that Jem will kill her if he discovers the truth, so he persuades her that the authorities cannot protect her, and she decides not to tell the police.After Claire tells Doug about being harassed and her car vandalized by Alex, a local thug, Doug enlists Jem for a favor, which they can never talk about. Doug and Jem don hockey masks and violently assault the offenders without Jem knowing the true reason for the favor is to protect Claire.FBI Agent Adam Frawley surveils the gang and recognizes their ties to local crime lord Fergus ""Fergie"" Colm, who has another robbery planned for them. During a visit to his father Stephen in prison, Doug reveals his plans to leave Boston and go to Florida. The gangs next robbery in the North End goes awry, and the gang barely escapes. The gang is interrogated by Frawley, but he fails to get any confessions and is forced to release them. Doug asks Claire if she will go away with him, and she agrees. When Frawley learns that Claire quit her job, he wiretaps her phone, and threatens to prosecute her as an accomplice after realizing that she is seeing Doug. Shocked to discover that her lover was one of her assailants, she is forced to cooperate with the FBI and breaks up with Doug. Meanwhile, Fergie and Jem are pressuring Doug about the next heist, but Doug is determined to get out. Fergie threatens to kill Claire if Doug does not go through with the job, and reveals to Doug how he controlled his father by making his mother an addict, which led to her suicide. Doug gives in but swears that he will kill Fergie if anything happens to Claire.At Fenway Park, Doug and Jem enter disguised as Boston police officers, steal $3,500,000 in gate cash, and prepare to escape in an ambulance, disguised as paramedics. Krista, Dougs ex-girlfriend and Jems sister, threatened by Frawley and heartbroken by Dougs going away without her, reveals enough for the FBI to surround Fenway before the gang can get out. The gang is caught in a firefight with FBI SWAT operators, and Dez and Gloansy are killed. Frawley spots Jem and they exchange gunfire. Jem, determined not to go back to prison and out of ammunition, commits suicide by cop by running out of cover with his guns unloaded and is killed. Knowing that Claire is in danger and that he will never escape as long as Fergie is alive, Doug murders Fergie and his bodyguard and calls Claire. Watching from across the street via binoculars, Doug sees that the FBI are with her as she tells him to come over. He at first thinks she means to betray him, but eventually she gives him a clue to warn him away, which he picks up on. Doug flees instead, donning an MBTA uniform and escaping on a train. He leaves a note on Frawleys car, reading ""GO FUCK YOURSELF"". Later, while gardening, Claire finds a buried bag containing the stolen money, a tangerine, and a note from Doug, suggesting that she can make better use of the money than he can, and that they might see each other again. Claire donates the money, in memory of Dougs mother, to refurbish the local ice hockey arena where Doug once played. From the deck of a small house, Doug looks out over the water, forlorn, but seemingly safe in Florida.",37000000,"[{""id"": 80, ""name"": ""Crime""}, {""id"": 18, ""name"": ""Drama""}, {""id"": 53, ""name"": ""Thriller""}]",http://thetownmovie.warnerbros.com/,23168,"[{""id"": 818, ""name"": ""based on novel""}, {""id"": 975, ""name"": ""money laundering""}, {""id"": 1546, ""name"": ""ambulance""}, {""id"": 1680, ""name"": ""boston""}, {""id"": 1700, ""name"": ""massachusetts""}, {""id"": 1929, ""name"": ""bank manager""}, {""id"": 2231, ""name"": ""drug dealer""}, {""id"": 2778, ""name"": ""florist""}, {""id"": 2779, ""name"": ""flower shop""}, {""id"": 3607, ""name"": ""hold-up robbery""}, {""id"": 8054, ""name"": ""volunteer""}, {""id"": 8627, ""name"": ""stolen money""}, {""id"": 9713, ""name"": ""friends""}, {""id"": 9775, ""name"": ""car set on fire""}, {""id"": 10847, ""name"": ""boston garden""}, {""id"": 11148, ""name"": ""police chase""}, {""id"": 12392, ""name"": ""best friend""}, {""id"": 155726, ""name"": ""fenway park""}]",en,"Doug MacRay is a longtime thief, who, smarter than the rest of his crew, is looking for his chance to exit the game.

667,668,The Tree of Life,2011,/wiki/The_Tree_of_Life_(film),"The film begins with a quotation from the Book of Job: ""Where were you when I laid the foundations of the Earth?... When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?""A mysterious, wavering light, resembling a flame, flickers in the darkness. Mrs. OBrien recalls a lesson taught to her that people must choose to follow either the path of grace or the path of nature. In the 1960s or thereabouts, she receives a telegram informing her of the death of her son, R.L., aged nineteen. Mr. OBrien is notified by telephone while at an airport. The family is thrown into turmoil.In the present day, the OBriens eldest son, Jack, is adrift in his modern life as an architect. One day he apologizes to his father on the phone for something he said about R.L.s death. In his office, Jack begins reflecting; shots of tall buildings under the sky, Jack wandering in the desert, trees that stretch from the ground up to the sun high in their leaves, and scenes from his 1950s childhood all link together and lead back to the flame.From the darkness the universe is born, the Milky Way and then the solar system form while voice-overs ask existential questions. On the newly formed Earth, volcanoes erupt and microbes begin to form and replicate. Sea life is born, then plants on land, then dinosaurs. In a symbolic first act of compassion, a dinosaur chooses not to eat another dinosaur that is injured and lying on the side of a river bed.  An asteroid tumbles through space and strikes the Earth, causing the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event.In a sprawling suburban neighborhood in the American South live the OBriens. The young couple is enthralled by their new baby Jack and, later, his two brothers. When Jack reaches adolescence, he is faced with the conflict of accepting the way of grace or nature, as embodied by each of his parents. Mrs. OBrien is gentle, nurturing, and authoritative, presenting the world to her children as a place of wonder. Mr. OBrien is strict and authoritarian, and easily loses his temper as he struggles to reconcile his love for his sons with wanting to prepare them for a world he sees as corrupt and exploitative. He laments his decision to work in a power plant instead of pursuing his passion for music. He tries to get ahead by filing patents for various inventions.Jacks perceptions of the world begin to change after one of his boyhood companions drowns at the pool and another is burned in a house fire. He becomes angry at his father for his bullying behavior and begins to keep a running tally of Mr. OBriens various hypocrisies and misdeeds, lashing out at his mother for tolerating such abusive behavior.One summer, Mr. OBrien takes a long business trip. While he is away, the boys enjoy unfettered access to their mother, and Jack experiences the first twinges of rebelliousness. Goaded by other boys his age, Jack commits acts of vandalism and animal abuse. He later trespasses into a neighbors house and steals her sheer nightgown. Jack is confused and angered by his feelings of sexuality and guilty trespass. He throws the stolen lingerie into a river to rid himself of it. Mr. OBrien returns home from his business trip. Shortly thereafter, the plant that he works at closes and he is given the option of relocating to work in an inferior position within the firm or losing his job. He and his family pack up to move to the new job location. He laments the course his life has taken, questioning whether he has been a good enough person. He asks Jack for forgiveness for his harsh treatment of him.In the present, adult Jack leaves work. Riding the elevator up, he experiences a vision of following a young girl across rocky terrain. Jack tentatively walks through a wooden door frame erected on the rocks and sees a view of the far distant future in which the sun expands into a red giant, engulfing the earth and then shrinking into a feeble white dwarf. Someone says ""follow me"" in the darkness, which is ended by the lighting of two candles. After emerging from rustic doors, Jack follows the girl and then a young version of himself across surreal landscapes. On a sandbar, Jack sees images of death and the dead returning to life. He is reunited with his family and all the people who populate his memory. His father is happy to see him. He encounters his dead brother, whom he brings to his parents. The parents are then seen saying goodbye to the young brother as he steps out of a home into a vast expanse. Accompanied by a woman in white and a young woman, Mrs. OBrien looks to the sky and whispers, ""I give him to you. I give you my son.""Jacks vision ends and he leaves the building smiling, while nature returns to the surrounding buildings as the sky is reflected in them.The mysterious wavering light continues to flicker in the darkness.",32000000,"[{""id"": 18, ""name"": ""Drama""}, {""id"": 14, ""name"": ""Fantasy""}]",http://www.twowaysthroughlife.com/,8967,"[{""id"": 490, ""name"": ""philosophy""}, {""id"": 494, ""name"": ""father son relationship""}, {""id"": 794, ""name"": ""red hair""}, {""id"": 1155, ""name"": ""brother sister relationship""}, {""id"": 1670, ""name"": ""sun""}, {""id"": 2285, ""name"": ""telegram""}, {""id"": 3352, ""name"": ""tree""}, {""id"": 5404, ""name"": ""meteor""}, {""id"": 6155, ""name"": ""afterlife""}, {""id"": 6712, ""name"": ""death of a child""}, {""id"": 10183, ""name"": ""independent film""}, {""id"": 10706, ""name"": ""spirituality""}, {""id"": 12405, ""name"": ""outer space""}, {""id"": 12616, ""name"": ""dinosaur""}, {""id"": 159431, ""name"": ""voice over""}, {""id"": 212412, ""name"": ""very little dialogue""}, {""id"": 215020, ""name"": ""tarkovskyesque""}]",en,"The impressionistic story of a Texas family in the 1950s.

Learning that Laurent is killed by wolves and to replace him and James, she attacks and bites Riley Biers in order to begin creating an army of newborns, who are many times stronger during their first few months than older vampires. Back in Forks, Edward Cullen and Bella Swan resume their relationship, and discuss the complications of becoming a vampire. At eighteen years old, one year older than Edward was when he became a vampire, Bella dislikes the idea of marrying so young, though Edward refuses to turn her into a vampire until they are married, his argument being that she should have a normal, human life. While Bellas father, Charlie Swan, investigates the disappearance of Riley Biers, Edward suspects his disappearance was caused by Victoria and her newborns army, furthering his suspicions of Riley Biers intrusion into Bellas bedroom to steal her red blouse.Bella insists that Jacob Black and the rest of the wolf pack would never harm her. Bella wants to go to Jacobs home, even though Edward expresses his dislike of Jacob and concern for her safety, but she returns unharmed. During one of her visits, Jacob confesses that he is in love with Bella, and forcefully kisses her. Furious, she punches him and sprains her hand, and Edward later threatens Jacob and tells him to only kiss her if she asks him to.

Back in Forks, Edward Cullen and Bella Swan resume their relationship, and discuss the complications of becoming a vampire. At eighteen years old, one year older than Edward was when he became a vampire, Bella dislikes the idea of marrying so young, though Edward refuses to turn her into a vampire until they are married, his argument being that she should have a normal, human life. While Bellas father, Charlie Swan, investigates the disappearance of Riley Biers, Edward suspects his disappearance was caused by Victoria and her newborns army, furthering his suspicions of Riley Biers intrusion into Bellas bedroom to steal her red blouse.Bella insists that Jacob Black and the rest of the wolf pack would never harm her. Bella wants to go to Jacobs home, even though Edward expresses his dislike of Jacob and concern for her safety, but she returns unharmed. During one of her visits, Jacob confesses that he is in love with Bella, and forcefully kisses her. Furious, she punches him and sprains her hand, and Edward later threatens Jacob and tells him to only kiss her if she asks him to.

They build a farm near a large, secluded forest and Katherine has a newborn child, Samuel. One day, Thomasin is playing peekaboo with Samuel when the baby abruptly disappears. It is revealed that a red-cloaked witch had stolen the unbaptized Samuel and that night kills him and uses his blood and fat to make a flying ointment.Katherine, devastated, spends her days crying and praying, while William insists a wolf stole the baby. Even though Katherine forbids the children going to the forest, William takes Caleb to lay a trap for food. Caleb asks if Samuels unbaptized soul will reach Heaven. William chastises Caleb for raising the question and later reveals to Caleb that he traded Katherines silver cup for hunting supplies. That night, Katherine questions Thomasin about the disappearance of her cup while implying Thomasin was responsible for Samuels vanishing. After the children retire to bed, they overhear their parents discussing sending Thomasin away to serve another family.Early the next morning, Thomasin finds Caleb preparing to check the trap in the forest. She forces Caleb to take her with him by threatening to awaken their parents. While walking in the woods, they spot a rabbit, which sends their horse Bert into a panic and their dog Fowler promptly chases. Caleb runs off after the pair, while the horse throws Thomasin off, knocking her unconscious. Caleb becomes lost in the woods and stumbles upon Fowlers disemboweled corpse. As he gets deeper into the woods, he comes across a hovel, where a beautiful young woman emerges and seduces him. William finds Thomasin and takes her home. Katherine angrily chastises Thomasin for taking Caleb into the woods and, to save Thomasin, William reluctantly admits that he sold Katherines silver cup.Caleb is found outdoors in the rain that night, naked and delirious from an unknown illness. When he awakens the next day, he expels a bloody apple from his mouth; Katherine believes it to be witchcraft. Caleb passionately proclaims his love to Christ before he dies. The twins then accuse Thomasin of witchcraft and, in retaliation, she reveals to the parents that the twins have had conversations with Black Phillip, the familys black goat. Enraged, William boards both Thomasin and the twins inside the goat house and plan to return to the plantation the next day. That night, the witch enters the stable and drinks milk from the goats, terrifying the twins and Thomasin. Katherine awakens to a vision of Caleb holding Samuel, whom she takes and begins breastfeeding. It is revealed that Samuel is in fact a black raven pecking at her bare and bloody breast.The next day William awakens to find the stable destroyed, the goats eviscerated, the twins missing and an unconscious Thomasin lying nearby with blood-stained hands. As Thomasin awakens, Black Phillip gores William before her eyes. The commotion awakens an unhinged Katherine, who now blames Thomasin for the tragedies that have beset the family and tries to strangle her. Thomasin kills her with a billhook in self-defense.Alone, Thomasin enters the stable and urges Black Phillip to speak to her. The goat asks if Thomasin would like to ""live deliciously"" and materializes into a tall, dark man. He orders Thomasin to remove her clothes and to sign her name in a book that appears. She replies that she does not know how to sign her name, so Black Phillip guides her hand. Thomasin follows Black Phillip, back in goat-form, into the forest, where she joins a coven of witches holding a Witches Sabbath around a bonfire.

Rothschild, employed under Mark Hanna, who quickly entices him with the sex and drugs fueled stockbroker culture and passes on his idea that a stockbrokers only goal is to make money for himself. Jordan soon finds his career terminated following Black Monday and takes a job at a boiler room brokerage firm on Long Island that specializes in penny stocks. Thanks to his aggressive pitching style and the high commissions, Jordan makes a small fortune.Jordan befriends his neighbor, Donnie Azoff, and the two found their own company. They recruit several of Jordans friends, whom Jordan trains in the art of the ""hard sell"". The basic method of the firm is a pump and dump scam. To cloak this, Jordan gives the firm the respectable-sounding name of Stratton Oakmont. After an exposé in Forbes, hundreds of ambitious young financiers flock to his company. Jordan becomes immensely successful and slides into a decadent lifestyle of prostitutes and drugs. He has an affair with a woman named Naomi Lapaglia. When his wife finds out, Jordan divorces her and marries Naomi. Meanwhile, the SEC and the FBI begin investigating Stratton Oakmont. Jordan illegally makes $22 million in three hours upon securing the IPO of Steve Madden. This brings him and his firm further to the attention of the FBI. To hide his money, Jordan opens a Swiss bank account with corrupt banker Jean-Jacques Saurel in the name of Naomis Aunt Emma, who is a British national and thus outside the reach of American authorities. He uses the wife and in-laws of his friend Brad Bodnick, who have European passports, to smuggle the cash into Switzerland.Donnie gets into a public brawl with Brad, and, while Donnie escapes, Brad is arrested. Brad does not say a word about Donnie or Jordan to the police. Jordan learns from his private investigator that the FBI is wiretapping his phones. Fearing for his son, Jordans father advises him to leave Stratton Oakmont and lie low while Jordans lawyer negotiates a deal to keep him out of prison. Jordan, however, cannot bear to quit and talks himself into staying in the middle of his farewell speech. Jordan, Donnie, and their wives are on a yacht trip to Italy when they learn that Aunt Emma has died of a heart attack. Jordan decides to travel to Switzerland immediately to settle the bank account. To bypass border controls, he orders his yacht captain to sail to Monaco, but the ship is capsized in a storm. After their rescue, the plane sent to take them to Geneva is destroyed when a seagull flies into the engine. Jordan takes this as a sign from God and decides to sober up.Two years later, the FBI arrests Jordan because Saurel, arrested in Florida on an unrelated charge, has informed the FBI on Jordan. Since the evidence against him is overwhelming, Jordan agrees to gather evidence on his colleagues in exchange for leniency. Now fed up with Jordans lifestyle, Naomi tells Jordan she is divorcing him and wants full custody of their children. Infuriated, Jordan hits Naomi twice, insults her as a ""cunt"" and tries to run off with his daughter Skylar in his car, but he ends up crashing in the driveway. The next morning, Jordan wears a wire to work but slips a note to Donnie warning him. Donnie keeps the note and rats out Jordan to the FBI. Jordan is arrested for breaching his co-operation deal. The FBI raids and shuts down Stratton Oakmont. Despite his breach, Jordan receives a reduced sentence for his testimony and serves three years in a minimum security prison.

Identifying herself as the fiancée of  his brother Ben, she asks him to return home to help locate Ben who has disappeared. At first refusing, Lawrence changes his mind and returns to his familys estate in Blackmoor where he has an uneasy reunion with his estranged father, Sir John. Unfortunately, Lawrence has arrived just after Bens mutilated body was discovered in a ditch near their home. At the local pub, Lawrence overhears the locals discussing the killing. It was thought to be a wild animal, but many blame Gypsies who are camped outside the town, while another patron claims there was a similar murder several decades earlier, and a werewolf was the suspected killer. Lawrence has flashbacks as he tours his familys home where his mother, Solana, committed suicide when he was a boy. Lawrence saw his father standing over her dead body; afterwards he was sent to an insane asylum in London having  suffered from delusions connected to the event.Lawrence visits the Gypsies during a full moon. The local townspeople raid the camp to confiscate a dancing bear they believe is the killer, but a werewolf attacks the camp, and bites Lawrence in the neck before being chased away by local hunters. A Gypsy woman named Maleva sutures his neck wounds, but her daughter insists the now cursed Lawrence should be killed before he destroys other lives. Maleva refuses, saying he is still a man and that only a loved one can release him.Lawrence recovers unnaturally quickly, and develops heightened vitality and senses. His fathers servant Singh shows Lawrence a set of silver bullets and implies that something monstrous is loose in Blackmoor. Inspector Aberline arrives to investigate the recent killings, and suspects Lawrence is responsible based on his mental history and portrayals of mentally-ill characters. Fearing for Gwen, Lawrence sends her away. He follows his father to his mothers crypt, where Sir John locks himself in a room alone as he gives a cryptic warning to Lawrence. Lawrence undergoes a painful transformation into the Wolfman before running off into the woods and killing the hunters stationed there.The next morning, Aberline and the police arrest the now human Lawrence. Taken to the same asylum he was committed to as a child, Lawrence is subjected to torturous treatments overseen by Dr. Hoenneger. Sir John visits Lawrence and explains that many years before while hunting in India, he was bitten by a feral boy infected with lycanthropy. Lawrence realizes his father, as a werewolf, killed his mother and his brother. Knowing that Lawrence would never be believed, Sir John confesses that this is true before leaving his son at the asylum permanently.By nightfall, Dr. Hoenneger conducts an evening lecture with Lawrence as a case study, and assures Lawrence that he is only a werewolf in his imagination, seeking to prove it by putting him on display during the full moon. As moonlight streams through the window, Lawrence transforms into the Wolfman and goes on a rampage throughout the lecture hall and London, with Aberline in pursuit. The next day, the now human Lawrence visits Gwens antique shop for help. They realize they are falling in love and share a passionate kiss. Aberline arrives and searches the shop, but Lawrence has already escaped to Blackmoor.Lawrence arrives at Talbot Hall and finds Singhs mutilated body. He loads a gun with Singhs silver bullets, but when he attempts to shoot his father, he learns that Sir John had removed the powder from the cartridges years ago.

Aberline attempts to shoot the Wolfman, but Gwen disrupts the shot. Attempting to physically confront Lawrence, Aberline is bitten.The Wolfman pursues Gwen and traps her above a gorge. She pleads with Lawrence, whose consciousness recognizes her. As he hesitates, the hunters approach, distracting the Wolfman long enough for Gwen to shoot him.

He is located by Yukio, a mutant with the ability to foresee peoples deaths, on behalf of Ichirō, now the CEO of a technology zaibatsu. Ichirō, who is dying of cancer, wants Logan to accompany Yukio to Japan so that he may repay his life debt. In Tokyo, Logan meets Ichirōs son, Shingen, and granddaughter, Mariko. There, Ichirō offers to transfer Logans healing abilities into his own body, thus saving Ichirōs life and alleviating Logan of his near-immortality, which Logan views as a curse. Logan refuses and prepares to leave the following day. That night, Ichirōs physician Dr. Green (also known as Viper) introduces something into Logans body, but Logan dismisses it as a dream.The next morning, Logan is informed that Ichirō has died.

Before Yukio arrives, Mariko is captured by the Yakuza. After interrogating one of the kidnappers, Logan and Yukio confront Marikos fiancé, corrupt Minister of Justice Noburo Mori.

674,675,The Words,2012,/wiki/The_Words_(film),"Clayton Hammond (Dennis Quaid) attends a public reading of his new book, The Words. Clayton begins reading from his book which focuses on a fictional character named Rory Jansen (Bradley Cooper), an aspiring writer who lives in New York City with his girlfriend, Dora (Zoe Saldana). Rory borrows some money from his father (J. K. Simmons), gets a job as a mail supervisor at a literary agency and attempts to sell his first novel, which is repeatedly rejected by publishers.After living together for some time, Rory and Dora marry and, during their honeymoon in Paris, Dora buys Rory an old briefcase he was admiring from an antiques store. After returning to America and having his book rejected again, Rory finds an old but masterfully written manuscript in the briefcase with a central character named Jack. Rory types the manuscript into his laptop. Later, while using the laptop, Dora happens upon the novel and reads it. She mistakenly assumes that Rory wrote the novel and convinces him to give it to a publisher at work, Joseph Cutler (Željko Ivanek). After a few months Joseph finally reads the manuscript and offers Rory a contract which he accepts. The book is a hit and Rory becomes famous.At this point, Hammond takes a break from the reading and goes backstage, where he is introduced by his agent (John Hannah) to Daniella (Olivia Wilde), a student and amateur writer who wants to interview him and notes that he is separated from his wife, although he still wears a wedding ring. Hammond agrees to meet her after the ceremony and returns to the stage, where he continues to read the book.The second part of the reading details Rory’s encounter with ""The Old Man"" (Jeremy Irons) in New York Citys Central Park, who reveals himself as the true author of the manuscript and that it was based on his life in Paris. He explains that he was a young man (Ben Barnes) when first stationed in France by the U.S. Army in the final days of World War II, where he fell in love with Celia (Nora Arnezeder), a French waitress. They eventually married and had a daughter, but the baby died shortly after birth. Unable to cope with the loss, Celia left him and moved to her parents house. He then used his pain as inspiration to write the manuscript, which he took to Celia while visiting her at her parents’ home. She found the story so moving that she chose to return to him. However, she unintentionally left the manuscript in a briefcase on the train after her trip back to Paris, thereby losing it. Because of the loss of the manuscript, their reconciliation was short-lived, and they divorced soon afterwards.The public reading ends and Hammond tells his fans they must buy the book to learn how it ends. Daniella then accompanies Hammond back to his apartment where she pressures him into telling her more. Hammond explains that Rory tells the truth about the creation of the story, first to his wife and then to Cutler. Also, Rory tells Cutler he wants to credit the old man as the true author. Cutler angrily advises against this as it would severely damage both their reputations and recommends giving the old man a share of the books profits instead.Rory then seeks out the old man to pay him and finds him working in a plant nursery. The old man refuses the money but, after doing so, reveals that while once riding a train to work, years after his divorce, he spotted Celia with a new husband and a young son at a train station. The old man points out that people always move on from their mistakes, and Rory will too.Daniella continues to pressure Hammond for more details. He reveals that the old man dies not long after Rory’s second meeting with him along with the secret about who the manuscripts author really is. Daniella deduces that The Words is actually an auto-biographical book, with Rory as Hammonds surrogate, and kisses him, reassuring him that people move on from their mistakes, but he pulls away. She asks him what he really wants, life or fiction. The film flashes to Dora reminiscing about her life with Rory, remembering happier times, and ends by telling him that ""were going to be fine.""",6000000,"[{""id"": 18, ""name"": ""Drama""}, {""id"": 53, ""name"": ""Thriller""}]",http://www.thewordsmovie.com/,83686,"[{""id"": 180404, ""name"": ""plagiarized book""}, {""id"": 180405, ""name"": ""stolen novel""}, {""id"": 180412, ""name"": ""plagiarized novel""}, {""id"": 180413, ""name"": ""aspiring writer""}]",en,"The Words follows young writer Rory Jansen who finally achieves long sought after literary success after publishing the next great American novel.

The Asgardian warriors defeat the Frost Giants and seize the source of their power, the Casket of Ancient Winters.In the present, Odins son Thor prepares to ascend to the throne of Asgard, but is interrupted when Frost Giants attempt to retrieve the Casket. Against Odins order, Thor travels to Jotunheim to confront Laufey, accompanied by his brother Loki, childhood friend Sif and the Warriors Three: Volstagg, Fandral, and Hogun. A battle ensues until Odin intervenes to save the Asgardians, destroying the fragile truce between the two races.

The Asgardian warriors defeat the Frost Giants and seize the source of their power, the Casket of Ancient Winters.In the present, Odins son Thor prepares to ascend to the throne of Asgard, but is interrupted when Frost Giants attempt to retrieve the Casket. Against Odins order, Thor travels to Jotunheim to confront Laufey, accompanied by his brother Loki, childhood friend Sif and the Warriors Three: Volstagg, Fandral, and Hogun. A battle ensues until Odin intervenes to save the Asgardians, destroying the fragile truce between the two races. For Thors arrogance, Odin strips his son of his godly power and exiles him to Earth as a mortal, accompanied by his hammer Mjölnir, now protected by an enchantment that allows only the worthy to wield it.Thor lands in New Mexico, where astrophysicist Dr. Jane Foster, her assistant Darcy Lewis, and mentor Dr. Erik Selvig find him.

682,683,Thor: The Dark World,2013,/wiki/Thor:_The_Dark_World,"Eons ago, Bor, father of Odin, clashes with the Dark Elf Malekith, who seeks to unleash a weapon known as the Aether on the nine realms. After conquering Malekiths forces, including enhanced warriors called the Kursed, on their home world of Svartalfheim, Bor safeguards the Aether within a stone column. Unknown to Bor, Malekith as well as his lieutenant Algrim and a handful of Dark Elves escape into suspended animation.In present-day Asgard, Loki stands imprisoned for his war crimes on Earth. Meanwhile, Thor, alongside warriors Fandral, Volstagg, and Sif, repel marauders on Vanaheim, home of their comrade Hogun; it is the final battle in a war to pacify the Nine Realms following the reconstruction of the Bifröst, the ""Rainbow Bridge"" between realms, which had been destroyed two years earlier. The Asgardians soon learn that the Convergence, a rare alignment of the Nine Realms, is imminent; as the event approaches, portals linking the worlds appear at random.In London, astrophysicist Dr. Jane Foster and her intern Darcy Lewis travel to an abandoned factory where such portals have appeared, disrupting the laws of physics around them. Separating from the group, Foster is teleported to another world, where she is infected by the Aether. Heimdall alerts Thor that Foster has moved beyond his near all-seeing vision, leading Thor to Earth. When Thor finds Foster, she inadvertently releases an unearthly force, and Thor returns with her to Asgard. Odin, recognizing the Aether, warns that the Aether will not only kill Foster but that its return heralds a catastrophic prophecy.Malekith, awakened by the Aethers release, turns Algrim into a Kursed and attacks Asgard. During the battle, Malekith and Algrim search for Foster, sensing that she contains the Aether. Thors mother Frigga is killed protecting Foster, and Malekith and Algrim are forced to flee without Foster. Despite Odins orders not to leave Asgard, Thor reluctantly enlists the help of Loki, who knows of a secret portal to Svartalfheim, where they will use Foster to lure and confront Malekith, away from Asgard. In return, Thor promises Loki vengeance on Malekith for killing their mother. With Volstagg and Sif stalling Asgardian soldiers and Fandral assisting their escape, Thor, Loki, and Foster head to Svartalfheim.There, Loki tricks Malekith into drawing the Aether out of Foster, but Thors attempt to destroy the exposed substance fails. Malekith merges with the Aether and leaves in his ship as Loki is fatally wounded while killing Algrim. Thor, cradling Loki in his arms, promises to tell their father of his sacrifice. Afterward, Thor and Foster discover another portal in a nearby cave and reunite in London with Lewis and Fosters mentor Dr. Erik Selvig—who was briefly institutionalized due to the mental trauma he suffered during Lokis attack on Earth. They learn that Malekith plans to restore the Dark Elves to dominance by unleashing the Aether at the center of the Convergence in Greenwich. Thor battles Malekith through various portals and across multiple worlds until one portal separates them, leaving Malekith unopposed on Earth. Thor returns in time to help his mortal comrades use their scientific equipment to transport Malekith to Svartalfheim, where he is crushed by his own damaged ship.Thor returns to Asgard, where he declines Odins offer to take the throne and tells Odin of Lokis sacrifice. As he leaves, Odins form transforms into Loki, who is alive and impersonating Odin.In a mid-credits scene, Volstagg and Sif visit the Collector and entrust the Aether to his care, commenting that with the Tesseract already in Asgard, having two Infinity Stones so close together would be unwise. As they leave, the Collector states his desire to acquire the other five Stones. In a post-credits scene, Foster and Thor reunite on Earth, while somewhere in London, a frost monster from Jotunheim—accidentally transported to Earth during the final battle—continues to run amok.",170000000,"[{""id"": 28, ""name"": ""Action""}, {""id"": 12, ""name"": ""Adventure""}, {""id"": 14, ""name"": ""Fantasy""}]",http://marvel.com/thor,76338,"[{""id"": 8828, ""name"": ""marvel comic""}, {""id"": 9715, ""name"": ""superhero""}, {""id"": 9717, ""name"": ""based on comic book""}, {""id"": 171783, ""name"": ""hostile takeover""}, {""id"": 179101, ""name"": ""norse mythology""}, {""id"": 179430, ""name"": ""aftercreditsstinger""}, {""id"": 179431, ""name"": ""duringcreditsstinger""}, {""id"": 180547, ""name"": ""marvel cinematic universe""}, {""id"": 209714, ""name"": ""3d""}, {""id"": 209818, ""name"": ""asgard""}]",en,"Thor fights to restore order across the cosmos… but an ancient race led by the vengeful Malekith returns to plunge the universe back into darkness.

They recover a safe containing a drawing of a young woman wearing only the necklace dated April 14, 1912, the day the ship struck the iceberg. Rose Dawson Calvert, the woman in the drawing, is brought aboard Keldysh and tells Lovett of her experiences aboard Titanic.In 1912 Southampton, 17-year-old first-class passenger Rose DeWitt Bukater, her fiancé Cal Hockley, and her mother Ruth board the luxurious Titanic. Ruth emphasizes that Roses marriage will resolve their familys financial problems and retain their high-class persona. Distraught over the engagement, Rose considers suicide by jumping from the stern; Jack Dawson, a penniless artist, intervenes and discourages her. Discovered with Jack, Rose tells a concerned Cal that she was peering over the edge and Jack saved her from falling. When Cal becomes indifferent, she suggests to him that Jack deserves a reward. He invites Jack to dine with them in first class the following night. Jack and Rose develop a tentative friendship, despite Cal and Ruth being wary of him. Following dinner, Rose secretly joins Jack at a party in third class.Aware of Cal and Ruths disapproval, Rose rebuffs Jacks advances, but realizes she prefers him over Cal. After rendezvousing on the bow at sunset, Rose takes Jack to her state room; at her request, Jack sketches Rose posing nude wearing Cals engagement present, the Heart of the Ocean necklace. They evade Cals bodyguard, Mr. Lovejoy, and have sex in an automobile inside the cargo hold. On the forward deck, they witness a collision with an iceberg and overhear the officers and designer discussing its seriousness.Cal discovers Jacks sketch of Rose and an insulting note from her in his safe along with the necklace. When Jack and Rose attempt to inform Cal of the collision, Lovejoy slips the necklace into Jacks pocket and he and Cal accuse him of theft. Jack is arrested, taken to the master-at-arms office, and handcuffed to a pipe. Cal puts the necklace in his own coat pocket.With the ship sinking, Rose flees Cal and her mother, who has boarded a lifeboat, and frees Jack. On the boat deck, Cal and Jack encourage her to board a lifeboat; Cal claims he can get himself and Jack off safely. After Rose boards one, Cal tells Jack the arrangement is only for himself. As her boat lowers, Rose decides that she cannot leave Jack and jumps back on board. Cal takes his bodyguards pistol and chases Rose and Jack into the flooding first-class dining saloon. After using up his ammunition, Cal realizes he gave his coat and consequently the necklace to Rose. He later boards a collapsible lifeboat by carrying a lost child.After braving several obstacles, Jack and Rose return to the boat deck.

Frank is transported to Tomorrowland, a futuristic cityscape, where advanced robots fix his jetpack, allowing him to fly and join the secretive world.Frank passes the narration to the optimistic teenager Casey Newton. In the present, Casey repeatedly sabotages the planned demolition of a NASA launch site in Florida. Her father, Eddie, is a NASA engineer, but faces redundancy. Casey is eventually caught and arrested. At the police station, she finds a strange pin in her belongings. Upon personal contact, the pin shows her a vision of Tomorrowland, til its battery runs out. With help from her younger brother Nate, Casey finds a Houston memorabilia store related to the pin. The owners, Hugo and Ursula, attack her when she is unable to divulge where she got the pin from. Athena, who gave Casey the pin, bursts in and defeats the owners, actually Audio-Animatronics, who self-destruct and destroy the shop. Casey and Athena steal a car, Athena revealing she is an animatronic, purposed to find and recruit people who fit the ideals of Tomorrowland. Athena drops Casey outside an adult Frank’s house in Pittsfield, New York.The reclusive, cynical Frank declines Casey’s request to take her to Tomorrowland, having been banished from it years ago. Inside Frank’s house, Casey finds a probability counter marking the end of the world, Frank warning her that the future is doomed, but she disagrees, lowering the counter’s probability. Animatronic assassins appear to kill Casey, but she and Frank escape. Frank resents Athena for lying to him about her true nature. He reluctantly agrees to help them get to Tomorrowland.Using a teleportation device, the trio travel to the top of the Eiffel Tower. Frank explains that Gustave Eiffel, Jules Verne, Nikola Tesla, and Thomas Edison co-founded Plus Ultra, a secret society of futurists, creating Tomorrowland in another dimension, free to make scientific breakthroughs without obstruction. The trio use an antique rocket, the Spectacle, hidden beneath the tower, to travel to Tomorrowland.There, they find Tomorrowland in a state of decay. David Nix, now Tomorrowland’s governor, greets them. They travel to a tachyon machine, invented by Frank, which accurately predicted the worldwide catastrophe. Casey refuses to accept the world will end, causing the future to temporarily alter. While Frank attempts to convince Nix to listen, he refuses, arresting the intruders.Casey realises the tachyon machine is telling humanity that the world will end, creating a self-fulfilling prophecy. They confront Nix, who admits he tried to prevent the future by projecting such images to humanity as a warning. Instead, they embraced the apocalypse in fiction, refusing to act to make a better future for their world. Frank, Casey, and Athena attempt to use a bomb to destroy the machine, leading to a fight with Nix. The bomb is accidentally thrown through a portal to an uninhabited island on Earth, the explosion pinning Nix’s leg. Athena sees a vision of the future where Frank is shot by Nix, and she jumps in the way of his attack, mortally wounding her. Making peace with Frank, Athena activates her self-destruct sequence, destroying the machine, but kills Nix too.In the present, Frank and Casey lead Tomorrowland, recruit Eddie and Nate, and create a new group of recruitment animatronics like Athena, who they are addressing at the beginning of the film. Given pins, the animatronic children set out to recruit new dreamers and thinkers for Tomorrowland.",190000000,"[{""id"": 12, ""name"": ""Adventure""}, {""id"": 10751, ""name"": ""Family""}, {""id"": 9648, ""name"": ""Mystery""}, {""id"": 878, ""name"": ""Science Fiction""}]",http://movies.disney.com/tomorrowland,158852,"[{""id"": 1436, ""name"": ""inventor""}, {""id"": 12332, ""name"": ""apocalypse""}, {""id"": 40850, ""name"": ""destiny""}, {""id"": 156395, ""name"": ""imax""}, {""id"": 173276, ""name"": ""dreamer""}, {""id"": 214714, ""name"": ""futuristic car""}, {""id"": 214715, ""name"": ""futuristic city""}]",en,"Bound by a shared destiny, a bright, optimistic teen bursting with scientific curiosity and a former boy-genius inventor jaded by disillusionment embark on a danger-filled mission to unearth the secrets of an enigmatic place somewhere in time and space that exists in their collective memory as ""Tomorrowland.""",130.311355,"[{""name"": ""Walt Disney Pictures"", ""id"": 2}, {""name"": ""Babieka"", ""id"": 20656}, {""name"": ""A113"", ""id"": 59778}]","[{""iso_3166_1"": ""US"", ""name"": ""United States of America""}]",5/19/2015,209154322,130,"[{""iso_639_1"": ""en"", ""name"": ""English""}]",Released,Imagine a world where nothing is impossible.,Tomorrowland,6.2,2846,0.748257339,0.799731255,0.048478633,0.72181946,-0.673340827,0.751252621,-0.051473916,0.492022455,1.100812221
686,687,Tower Heist,2011,/wiki/Tower_Heist,"Josh Kovaks is the building manager of The Tower, an upscale apartment complex in New York City. Its employees include Joshs brother-in-law, concierge Charlie Gibbs, who is expecting a child with Joshs sister; Enrique DevReaux, a newly hired elevator operator; Lester, the doorman nearing retirement; Odessa Montero, an immigrant maid from Jamaica threatened with deportation; and receptionist Miss Iovenko, who is studying to become a lawyer.One morning Josh witnesses what he believes is Arthur Shaw, The Towers penthouse tenant, being kidnapped. Josh gives chase, but is tackled by FBI agent Claire Denham, who explains that Shaw was actually attempting to flee the country and resist arrest for masterminding a Ponzi scheme, embezzling $2 billion. Josh confesses to the Tower staff that he gave their pensions to Shaw to invest, and they have lost everything; Lester attempts suicide by stepping in front of a train, but survives. After visiting Lester in the hospital, Josh, Charlie, and Enrique confront Shaw, under house arrest in his penthouse apartment. Shaw expresses condolences, but is not sincere enough when he forgets to ask if Lester is all right. Out of anger, Josh smashes the windows of the 1963 Ferrari 250 GT Lusso displayed in Shaws apartment. Joshs boss Mr. Simon fires him for his actions, as well as Charlie and Enrique, who were with him at the time of his actions.Josh meets Denham at a bar where she drunkenly suggests that Shaw has concealed $20 million as a reserve, and that Josh should steal it. Josh, Charlie, Enrique, and evicted Tower tenant Mr. Fitzhugh conspire to find and steal the money from Shaws assumed safe. They supplement their inexperience by enlisting Joshs childhood friend Slide, a petty criminal, and Odessa, who has locksmith experience that can help open the safe. Charlie is later rehired as the Towers new manager, and warns Josh to abandon the plan or Charlie will turn him over to the police. Subsequently, Denham informs Josh that Shaw is scheduled to attend court on Thanksgiving during the Macys Thanksgiving Day Parade to avoid publicity, and that Shaw will be set free. Josh and his team decide to break into Shaws apartment during the parade.Slide attempts to betray the team by reaching the safe first, having tricked Odessa into giving him lessons. The team intercepts him at Shaws apartment and during the ensuing altercation, they break down a false wall, revealing Shaws safe, which turns out to be empty. Slide and Fitzhugh fight over Slides gun; which goes off, the bullet hits the car, revealing gold underneath the Ferraris paint. They realize that Shaw used his money to buy gold, turn it into car parts, and assembled the car to hide the money in plain sight. Later, Josh finds a ledger of Shaws illegal finances in the cars glove box.As they reach the lobby, Denham and Shaw return revealing the Thanksgiving Day court date to be a ruse. Denham notes the missing car and Shaws safe remanding him back into federal custody until his real court date for violating his bail by not declaring the latter. Denham and the FBI arrest Josh and the crew (except Slide) as they walk out of The Tower. Miss Iovenko arrives, telling the FBI that she passed her bar exam three days ago and will be acting as Joshs attorney. She shows them Shaws ledger and tells them she will turn it over in exchange for everyones freedom. The FBI accepts on the condition that Josh, being the primary conspirator serve a minimal two-year sentence. Shaw pleads guilty and is sentenced to life in prison.The team retrieve the car and send various parts to Tower employees to compensate for their lost pensions, as Josh is led to his cell, a satisfied smile slowly forms on his face.",75000000,"[{""id"": 28, ""name"": ""Action""}, {""id"": 35, ""name"": ""Comedy""}]",http://www.towerheist.com/index.php,59108,"[{""id"": 1418, ""name"": ""skyscraper""}, {""id"": 4543, ""name"": ""thanksgiving""}, {""id"": 12547, ""name"": ""billionaire""}, {""id"": 15275, ""name"": ""parade""}, {""id"": 18525, ""name"": ""fbi agent""}, {""id"": 33632, ""name"": ""apartment""}, {""id"": 156640, ""name"": ""high rise""}, {""id"": 158750, ""name"": ""female agent""}, {""id"": 159325, ""name"": ""ponzi scheme""}, {""id"": 159330, ""name"": ""empty safe""}, {""id"": 159333, ""name"": ""caper comedy""}, {""id"": 159334, ""name"": ""planning""}, {""id"": 159339, ""name"": ""safecracker""}, {""id"": 159341, ""name"": ""recruiting""}, {""id"": 159343, ""name"": ""heist movie""}, {""id"": 159346, ""name"": ""deceit""}, {""id"": 159350, ""name"": ""lobby""}]",en,"A luxury condo manager leads a staff of workers to seek payback on the Wall Street swindler who defrauded them.

687,688,Toy Story 2,2010,/wiki/Toy_Story_2,"Andy prepares to go to cowboy camp with Woody,  but while playing with Woody and Buzz, he accidentally tears Woodys arm. Andys mom puts Woody on a shelf, and Andy leaves without Woody. The next day after Woody has a nightmare of being thrown away, he finds a toy penguin Wheezy who has been shelved for months due to a broken squeaker. Andys mother puts Wheezy in a yard sale, but Woody rescues him, only to be stolen by a greedy toy collector, who takes him to his apartment. Buzz Lightyear and the rest of Andys toys identify the thief from a commercial to be Al McWhiggin, the owner of Als Toy Barn. Buzz, Hamm, Mr. Potato Head, Slinky Dog, and Rex set out to rescue Woody.At Als apartment, Woody learns that he is based on a 1950s television show called Woodys Roundup, and that along with the other Roundup toys – Jessie, Bullseye, and Stinky Pete the Prospector – he is set to be sold to a toy museum in Tokyo, Japan. While the others are excited about going, Woody intends to return home to Andy. Stinky Pete explains that the museum is only interested in the collection if it is complete, and without Woody, they will be returned to storage. When Woodys arm is torn off completely, Woody attempts to retrieve it and escape, but his attempt to do so is foiled when Als television set turns on, and blames Jessie when he finds the TV remote in front of her, and the two get into a fight. The next morning, Woodys arm is fixed by a toy repair specialist and he learns that Jessie once belonged to a girl named Emily, who eventually outgrew her and gave her away. Stinky Pete warns him that the same fate awaits him when Andy grows up, whereas he will last forever in the museum. Woody decides to stay, now believing that all toys will eventually get discarded by their owners.Meanwhile, Buzz and the other toys reach Als Toy Barn. While searching for Woody, Buzz is imprisoned by a Utility Belt Buzz, who believes that Buzz is a rogue space ranger; he joins the other toys, who mistake him for Andys Buzz. After discovering Als plan, they go to his apartment, while Andys Buzz escapes and pursues them, accidentally freeing an Emperor Zurg toy, who follows him with the intent of destroying him. After the toys find Woody, Buzz rejoins them and proves that he is Andys Buzz, but Woody refuses to go home. Buzz reminds Woody that a toys true purpose is to be played with, which he would never experience in a museum. After seeing a boy play with him on television, Woody realizes that Buzz was right, and asks the Roundup gang to come home with him and Andys toys. However, Stinky Pete declines and stops them from leaving, revealing that he wants to go to the museum to be appreciated forever, having never been sold or played with. He was also the one responsible for foiling Woodys earlier escape attempt and framing Jessie for it. Al then returns, takes the gang in a suitcase and leaves for the airport.Andys toys pursue Al, but are caught by Zurg, who battles Utility Belt Buzz, until Rex inadvertently knocks him off the elevator. Utility Belt Buzz then chooses to remain behind with Zurg, who has revealed himself as Buzzs father. Accompanied by three toy Aliens, Andys toys steal a Pizza Planet delivery truck and follow Al to the airport, where they enter the baggage handling system and find Als suitcase. Stinky Pete rips Woodys arm during a struggle, but Andys toys stuff him into a little girls backpack. They free Bullseye, only for Jessie to end up on the plane bound for Japan. Assisted by Buzz and Bullseye, Woody frees Jessie, and the toys find their way home.When Andy returns from camp, he accepts Jessie, Bullseye, and the Aliens as his new toys, thinking that his mother bought them and repairs Woodys torn arm. Als business has suffered due to him failing to sell the Roundup gang, while Wheezys squeaker has also been fixed.

693,694,Transformers: Age of Extinction,2014,/wiki/Transformers:_Age_of_Extinction,"Sixty-five million years ago, an alien race known as the “Creators” used devices called Seeds to terraform Planet Earth, covering it with an alloy called Transformium. In the present day, geologist Darcy Tyril excavates the Transformium for K.S.I. Industries, which uses it to build man-made Transformer drones.Five years after the Battle of Chicago, humans have begun to view the Transformers as a threat, leading the U.S. government to terminate all human-Autobot joint programs. Although the public believes that the Autobots have been granted sanctuary, they are being hunted by a rogue CIA black ops division known as Cemetery Wind, led by opportunistic government official Harold Attinger, who believes that all Transformers should be exterminated regardless of their faction. They are aided by Lockdown, a Cybertronian bounty hunter working for the Creators, promising to give Attinger a Seed if his division manages to capture Optimus Prime. Cemetery Wind locates Ratchet in Mexico City and Lockdown kills him when he refuses to give up the whereabouts of Optimus Prime.Optimus, damaged in Mexico City and disguised as a rundown semi-truck, is discovered in an abandoned theater by Cade Yeager, a financially struggling Texan inventor, and brings him back to his farm. While his teenage daughter Tessa and business partner Lucas Flannery encourage him to turn Optimus over to the authorities after realizing what he really is, Cade instead fixes Optimus, hoping to understand his technology and unexpectedly revives him. Still skeptical of Optimus, Lucas calls Cemetery Wind, who attacks and destroys the farm, but Optimus and Tessas boyfriend, Irish rally car driver Shane Dyson, come to the familys aid. While on the run from Cemetery Wind and Lockdown, Lucas is killed by one of Lockdowns grenades. Escaping into the desert, they take refuge in an abandoned gas station. Later, Optimus scans a passing truck and turns into a Western Star 5700 Phantom Custom truck with the original red and blue paint with flames, and summons the surviving Autobots – Bumblebee, who has assumed an alternate form, Hound, Drift, and Crosshairs – who have come to distrust humans due to Cemetery Wind constantly hunting them down. Using a CIA drone which he stole during the home invasion, Cade discovers K.S.I.s involvement in the attacks on the Autobots. Optimus vows to personally kill Attinger for his actions against his brethren.Infiltrating K.S.I.s headquarters in Chicago, Cade discovers the remains of Autobots and Decepticons are being melted down to make the drones. Joshua Joyce, the ambitious company CEO, is in league with Attinger to revolutionize global defenses and improve human society using the Seed. He has captured Brains and used him and data from Megatrons head to create the drones and prototype Transformer soldiers Galvatron and Stinger. In a fit of rage, the Autobots storm the building, during which Bumblebee regains his original form by scanning a passing car, where they rescue Brains and destroy the laboratory, but they soon leave after Joshua announces that they are no longer needed. Attinger forces Joshua to deploy Galvatron and Stinger to attack the Autobots. During the battle, Galvatrons behavior becomes slightly erratic when it starts destroying vehicles, and when it fights Optimus it speaks to him. Lockdown then arrives and abducts Optimus while Galvatron and Stinger retreat; Tessa is inadvertently captured alongside Optimus in the midst of the chaos, leaving Cade and Shane devastated.While Lockdowns large prison spacecraft hovers over Chicago to hand over the Seed, Cade, Shane, and the Autobots use the opportunity to sneak on board and rescue Optimus and Tessa, hijacking a smaller ship containing a group of Autobots called the Dinobots, just before Lockdown leaves Earth. The Autobots reveal to Cade that ""Galvatron"" is in fact Megatron, who gave K.S.I. the data to build the Transformer drones so he could transfer his consciousness into the Galvatron drone, after they had unknowingly revived him, and that Galvatron is plotting to use the Seed and the K.S.I. drones to conquer the world by detonating the Seed in Hong Kong, as K.S.I. has brought it there to use it in the remote Mongolian desert to create vast amounts of usable Transformium. Cade informs Joshua of Megatrons presence, causing him to have a change of heart and agreeing to hand over the Seed with help from Darcy and his Chinese business associate Su Yueming. Meanwhile, Lockdown discovers Optimus escape with the Dinobots, and returns to Earth to retrieve them. Optimus decides for the Autobots to no longer help the humans because of how they revived Megatron, but Cade explains to Optimus why he shouldnt lose faith in them. Back at the facility, during a disagreement between Joshua and Attinger over the Seed, Galvatron reactivates himself and promptly takes control of the K.S.I. drones, and a battle follows in Hong Kongs streets between Cades group, the Autobots, Cemetery Wind, Galvatron, and his drones. During the fight, Optimus gains the alliance of the Dinobots, who become essential to the Autobots victory while Bumblebee kills Stinger.Lockdown returns to capture Optimus and the Dinobots, using a large magnet in his ship that picks up and drops metal objects, causing destruction to the city. After disabling the magnet, Optimus fights Lockdown at an abandoned factory. In the ensuing duel, Optimus kills Attinger (who still angrily deems all Cybertronians aside from Lockdown as a threat) to save Cade, and avenging the deaths of his fellow Autobots. However, this allows Lockdown to pin Optimus down by impaling his chest with his own sword. Cade, Bumblebee, Tessa, and Shane fight Lockdown, with Cade ending up fighting him one-on-one while Tessa and Shane use a tow truck to free Optimus, who kills Lockdown by cutting him in half before using one of his grenades to finish off the remaining drones. Galvatron retreats, vowing to return. As Lockdowns ship leaves Earth, Optimus tells the Autobots to protect the Yeagers (with Joshua offering to help the Yeagers build a new home) and lets the Dinobots go, before flying away into space with the Seed to hide it away, sending a message to the Creators that he is coming for them.",210000000,"[{""id"": 878, ""name"": ""Science Fiction""}, {""id"": 28, ""name"": ""Action""}, {""id"": 12, ""name"": ""Adventure""}]",http://www.transformersmovie.com,91314,"[{""id"": 9663, ""name"": ""sequel""}, {""id"": 9951, ""name"": ""alien""}, {""id"": 10607, ""name"": ""transformers""}, {""id"": 10891, ""name"": ""giant robot""}, {""id"": 14544, ""name"": ""robot""}, {""id"": 156395, ""name"": ""imax""}, {""id"": 166594, ""name"": ""transforming robot""}]",en,"As humanity picks up the pieces, following the conclusion of ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon,"" Autobots and Decepticons have all but vanished from the face of the planet.

694,695,Transformers: Dark of the Moon,2014,/wiki/Transformers:_Dark_of_the_Moon,"In 1961, the ""Ark"", a Cybertronian spacecraft carrying an invention capable of ending the war between the benevolent Autobots and the malevolent Decepticons, crash lands on the dark side of Earths Moon. The crash is detected on Earth by NASA, and President John F. Kennedy authorizes a mission to put a man on the Moon as a cover for investigating the spacecraft. In 1969, the crew of Apollo 11 lands on the Moon.In the present, the Autobots assist the United States military in preventing major conflicts around the globe. During a mission to Chernobyl to investigate suspected alien technology, Optimus Prime finds a fuel cell from the ""Ark"", discovering that it had survived its journey from Cybertron. The Autobots are then attacked by a giant Cybertronian worm called the Driller and his master Shockwave, a Decepticon scientist, who manages to escape. After learning of the top-secret mission to the Moon, the Autobots travel there to explore the ""Ark"". They discover a comatose Sentinel Prime—Optimuss predecessor as leader of the Autobots—and five Pillars he created as a means of establishing a Space Bridge between two points to teleport matter. After returning to Earth, Optimus uses the energy of his Matrix of Leadership to revive Sentinel Prime.Meanwhile, Sam Witwicky is frustrated that he is unable to work with the Autobots or find a job. He also becomes envious of the close relationship between his new girlfriend, Carly Spencer, and her boss Dylan Gould. After finding work, Sam is provided information by his eccentric co-worker Jerry Wang about the ""Ark"", before Jerry is assassinated by the Decepticon Laserbeak. Sam contacts the now independently wealthy Sector 7 Agent Seymour Simmons, and together they realize that the Decepticons and their leader, Megatron, are murdering people connected to the American and Soviet space missions to the ""Ark"". They locate two surviving cosmonauts, who reveal satellite photos of hundreds of Pillars being stockpiled on the Moon. Sam realizes that the Decepticons raided the ""Ark"" long before the Apollo 11 mission to the moon and intentionally left Sentinel and the five Pillars for the Autobots to find, as Sentinel is the key to activating the Pillars and the Decepticons lacked the means to revive him. The Autobots fight off three pursuing Decepticons: the Dreads, and rush to return Sentinel to their base for protection, but Sentinel betrays them and murders the Autobot Ironhide, revealing he had made a deal with Megatron to ensure Cybertrons survival.Sentinel uses the Pillars to transport hundreds of concealed Decepticons from the Moon to Earth. Carly is later captured by Dylan, who is revealed to be in service of the Decepticons. The Autobots are exiled from Earth at the demand of the Decepticons to avoid war, but as their ship leaves Earth it is destroyed by Starscream, seemingly killing the Autobots. The Decepticons, led by Megatron and Sentinel, invade Chicago as their agents place Pillars around the world. Dylan reveals to Carly that the Decepticons plan to transport their homeworld Cybertron to the Solar System, and then enslave humanity and use Earths resources to rebuild their world. Sam teams up with former USAF Chief Robert Epps and several ex-NEST soldiers to go into Chicago to save Carly and arrest Dylan, but they are nearly killed by Decepticon forces before the Autobots intervene, revealing they concealed themselves during the launch of their ship to convince the Decepticons they were destroyed.Working together, the Autobots, along with several ex-Rangers and Navy SEALs, manage to rescue Carly and kill Laserbeak, the Driller, Starscream, Soundwave, and Shockwave, with Optimus using Shockwaves arm-cannon to blast the Control Pillar, disabling the Space Bridge. During the battle, the Autobot Wheeljack is killed while Wheelie and Brains sneak on board a Decepticon warship and sabotage it. Sam confronts Dylan as he reactivates the Control Pillar, and knocks Dylan into the Pillar, killing him. Bumblebee and Ratchet arrive and destroy the Control Pillar, permanently disabling the Bridge and causing the partially transported Cybertron to implode. Optimus and Sentinel fight while Carly convinces Megatron that he will be replaced by Sentinel as leader of the Decepticons. Sentinel severs Optimuss right arm and is about to execute him until Megatron, having listened to Carly, intervenes, incapacitating Sentinel. Megatron slyly proposes a truce, having the desire to become the one in charge again, but Optimus instead attacks Megatron, decapitating and killing him. Sentinel pleads for his life, but Optimus executes him too for his betrayal. With the Decepticons defeated, Carly and Sam are reunited and the Autobots accept that, with Cybertron gone for good, Earth is now their home.",195000000,"[{""id"": 28, ""name"": ""Action""}, {""id"": 878, ""name"": ""Science Fiction""}, {""id"": 12, ""name"": ""Adventure""}]",http://www.transformersmovie.com/,38356,"[{""id"": 305, ""name"": ""moon""}, {""id"": 1612, ""name"": ""spacecraft""}, {""id"": 2052, ""name"": ""traitor""}, {""id"": 3088, ""name"": ""bodyguard""}, {""id"": 10158, ""name"": ""alien planet""}, {""id"": 10244, ""name"": ""based on cartoon""}, {""id"": 10607, ""name"": ""transformers""}, {""id"": 10891, ""name"": ""giant robot""}, {""id"": 15246, ""name"": ""sabotage""}, {""id"": 15247, ""name"": ""word domination""}, {""id"": 15248, ""name"": ""commando""}, {""id"": 179431, ""name"": ""duringcreditsstinger""}]",en,"Sam Witwicky takes his first tenuous steps into adulthood while remaining a reluctant human ally of Autobot-leader Optimus Prime.

During a mission to Chernobyl to investigate suspected alien technology, Optimus Prime finds a fuel cell from the ""Ark"", discovering that it had survived its journey from Cybertron. The Autobots are then attacked by a giant Cybertronian worm called the Driller and his master Shockwave, a Decepticon scientist, who manages to escape. After learning of the top-secret mission to the Moon, the Autobots travel there to explore the ""Ark"". They discover a comatose Sentinel Prime—Optimuss predecessor as leader of the Autobots—and five Pillars he created as a means of establishing a Space Bridge between two points to teleport matter. After returning to Earth, Optimus uses the energy of his Matrix of Leadership to revive Sentinel Prime.Meanwhile, Sam Witwicky is frustrated that he is unable to work with the Autobots or find a job. He also becomes envious of the close relationship between his new girlfriend, Carly Spencer, and her boss Dylan Gould. After finding work, Sam is provided information by his eccentric co-worker Jerry Wang about the ""Ark"", before Jerry is assassinated by the Decepticon Laserbeak. Sam contacts the now independently wealthy Sector 7 Agent Seymour Simmons, and together they realize that the Decepticons and their leader, Megatron, are murdering people connected to the American and Soviet space missions to the ""Ark"". They locate two surviving cosmonauts, who reveal satellite photos of hundreds of Pillars being stockpiled on the Moon. Sam realizes that the Decepticons raided the ""Ark"" long before the Apollo 11 mission to the moon and intentionally left Sentinel and the five Pillars for the Autobots to find, as Sentinel is the key to activating the Pillars and the Decepticons lacked the means to revive him. The Autobots fight off three pursuing Decepticons: the Dreads, and rush to return Sentinel to their base for protection, but Sentinel betrays them and murders the Autobot Ironhide, revealing he had made a deal with Megatron to ensure Cybertrons survival.Sentinel uses the Pillars to transport hundreds of concealed Decepticons from the Moon to Earth. Carly is later captured by Dylan, who is revealed to be in service of the Decepticons. The Autobots are exiled from Earth at the demand of the Decepticons to avoid war, but as their ship leaves Earth it is destroyed by Starscream, seemingly killing the Autobots. The Decepticons, led by Megatron and Sentinel, invade Chicago as their agents place Pillars around the world. Dylan reveals to Carly that the Decepticons plan to transport their homeworld Cybertron to the Solar System, and then enslave humanity and use Earths resources to rebuild their world. Sam teams up with former USAF Chief Robert Epps and several ex-NEST soldiers to go into Chicago to save Carly and arrest Dylan, but they are nearly killed by Decepticon forces before the Autobots intervene, revealing they concealed themselves during the launch of their ship to convince the Decepticons they were destroyed.Working together, the Autobots, along with several ex-Rangers and Navy SEALs, manage to rescue Carly and kill Laserbeak, the Driller, Starscream, Soundwave, and Shockwave, with Optimus using Shockwaves arm-cannon to blast the Control Pillar, disabling the Space Bridge. During the battle, the Autobot Wheeljack is killed while Wheelie and Brains sneak on board a Decepticon warship and sabotage it. Sam confronts Dylan as he reactivates the Control Pillar, and knocks Dylan into the Pillar, killing him. Bumblebee and Ratchet arrive and destroy the Control Pillar, permanently disabling the Bridge and causing the partially transported Cybertron to implode. Optimus and Sentinel fight while Carly convinces Megatron that he will be replaced by Sentinel as leader of the Decepticons. Sentinel severs Optimuss right arm and is about to execute him until Megatron, having listened to Carly, intervenes, incapacitating Sentinel. Megatron slyly proposes a truce, having the desire to become the one in charge again, but Optimus instead attacks Megatron, decapitating and killing him. Sentinel pleads for his life, but Optimus executes him too for his betrayal. With the Decepticons defeated, Carly and Sam are reunited and the Autobots accept that, with Cybertron gone for good, Earth is now their home.",195000000,"[{""id"": 28, ""name"": ""Action""}, {""id"": 878, ""name"": ""Science Fiction""}, {""id"": 12, ""name"": ""Adventure""}]",http://www.transformersmovie.com/,38356,"[{""id"": 305, ""name"": ""moon""}, {""id"": 1612, ""name"": ""spacecraft""}, {""id"": 2052, ""name"": ""traitor""}, {""id"": 3088, ""name"": ""bodyguard""}, {""id"": 10158, ""name"": ""alien planet""}, {""id"": 10244, ""name"": ""based on cartoon""}, {""id"": 10607, ""name"": ""transformers""}, {""id"": 10891, ""name"": ""giant robot""}, {""id"": 15246, ""name"": ""sabotage""}, {""id"": 15247, ""name"": ""word domination""}, {""id"": 15248, ""name"": ""commando""}, {""id"": 179431, ""name"": ""duringcreditsstinger""}]",en,"Sam Witwicky takes his first tenuous steps into adulthood while remaining a reluctant human ally of Autobot-leader Optimus Prime.

One of them later known as ""The Fallen"", defies their rule to never to destroy planets with life by establishing a Sun Harvester on Earth. He is confronted by, the other Primes, who imprison the Fallen before he can harvest the planets Sun using the Matrix of Leadership. The rest of the Primes then sacrifice themselves to hide the Matrix in an unknown location.In the present, two years after Megatrons defeat, the Autobots and the U.S. military have formed the Non-biological Extraterrestrial Species Treaty (NEST), a classified international task force used to eliminate the surviving Decepticons. In Shanghai, the Autobots intercept two Decepticons, Demolisher and Sideways. Sideways is killed by the Autobot Sideswipe, while Optimus Prime kills Demolisher, but not before he warns them of the Fallens return. At NESTs secure headquarters in Diego Garcia, National Security Adviser Theodore Galloway concludes the Decepticons are still on Earth to hunt the Autobots, since Megatrons corpse is at the bottom of the Laurentian Abyss and the last-known AllSpark shard is secured in the base. Soundwave hacks into a military satellite, overhears the information, and sends Ravage to retrieve the shard.Meanwhile, Sam Witwicky is preparing to attend college, leaving his girlfriend Mikaela Banes and guardian Bumblebee behind. He finds a smaller AllSpark shard and picks it up, causing him to see Cybertronian symbols. As a side effect, the shards energy brings various kitchen appliances to life, who then attack Sam and his family. After Bumblebee kills the living appliances, Sam gives the shard to Mikaela, who later captures Decepticon Wheelie when he attempts to steal it. The Constructicons resurrect Megatron by brutally ripping apart the Constructicon Scrapmetal to provide parts for him, as well as using the stolen shard. Megatron then travels to one of Saturns moons, where he reunites with his master, the Fallen, who orders him to capture Sam alive and kill Optimus, as he is the only Transformer who can defeat the Fallen. After killing Alice, a Decepticon Pretender disguised as a college student, Sam, Mikaela and his college roommate, Leo are captured by the Decepticon Grindor and taken to an abandoned factory. Megatron reveals that the symbols in Sams mind will lead the Decepticons to a new Energon source before Optimus and Bumblebee arrive to rescue the trio. Optimus engages Megatron, Starscream, and Grindor; though Optimus injures Starscream by cutting his arm off and killing Grindor, Megatron kills Optimus by impaling him through the chest, destroying his spark. The other Autobots arrive and repel the Decepticons, forcing Megatron and Starscream to retreat. The Decepticons launch devastating simultaneous attacks around the world, destroying ships in the Second Fleet and damaging Paris. The Fallen hijacks Earths telecommunications systems, demanding that Sam be handed to him. Sam, Mikaela, and Leo enlist the help of former Sector Seven agent, Seymour Simmons, who reveals that the Transformers visited Earth eons ago and the most ancient, known as Seekers, remained on Earth, hiding in secret. With help from Wheelie, they track down a Decepticon Seeker named Jetfire at the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum. They use their shard to revive Jetfire, who teleports the group to Egypt and explains the story of the Fallen. Jetfire and Wheelie turn against the Decepticons, and order them to locate the Matrix, which could revive Optimus. Sams group finds the Matrix in Petra, but it disintegrates into dust in Sams hands. Undeterred, Sam stuffs the Matrixs remains into his sock.Meanwhile, NEST forces and the Autobots land near the Giza pyramid complex but are attacked by a large force of Decepticons.

699,700,Triple 9,2016,/wiki/Triple_9,"In Atlanta, criminals Michael Atwood (Chiwetel Ejiofor), Russell Welch (Norman Reedus) and his brother Gabe Welch (Aaron Paul), and corrupt cops Marcus Belmont (Anthony Mackie) and Franco Rodriguez (Clifton Collins Jr.) rob a bank to retrieve a safe deposit box. The box contains information that could overturn the recent conviction of a Jewish-Russian Mafia boss. When Michael brings the safe deposit box to the boss wife, Irina (Kate Winslet), she withholds their reward money and gives Michael and his crew another mission, which involves breaking into a government office and stealing more data on her husband. To convince them to take the job, the mafia tortures and then dumps a mortally wounded Russell off in front of the crew, forcing Michael to mercy-kill Russell in front of them, traumatizing Gabe.The group decides to go forward with the job. As they think of ways they can pull it off, Marcus and Franco suggest a Triple 9 scenario, which involves an officer down call that sends all of the police to the location of the incident, with Marcus nominating his new partner, Chris Allen (Casey Affleck). Marcus tries to befriend Chris as they go out on calls together. During one call, Chris attempts to question a local gang member, Luis Pinto (Luis Da Silva), about a gang-related homicide, only for Luis to attack Chris before being detained for his actions. Chriss uncle, Jeffrey Allen (Woody Harrelson), is a Sgt. Detective in the police force working on the bank robbery case. Jeffrey gets a lead and discovers that Gabe is one of the people involved in the bank robbery. Gabe, still grieving over his brother, tries to stop the heist from happening by following Chris and Marcus around and telling Chris, but is stopped both by Michael and Jeffrey.On the day of the heist, Marcus takes Chris to an abandoned housing project to meet an informant with information on their homicide case. As they walk around the building, Marcus slips away, and Luis comes in and tries to find Chris. Chris bumps into Gabe who tries to warn him that he is going to die. Luis then charges in and tries to shoot Chris but hits Gabe. As Luis runs away, Chris confronts a critically wounded Gabe. Before Gabe can say anything, Marcus comes in, triggering a shootout between the two. Gabe is killed, and Marcus is shot in the head. Fearing Marcus is dead, Chris makes the Triple 9 call. Thinking his nephew is the officer down, Jeffrey rushes to the scene. Meanwhile, Michael and Franco break into the government office and steal the information with little police disruption. Luis flees the projects and is later shot dead by SWAT after barricading himself in a nearby home.In the aftermath, Marcus survives but is in critical condition. Michael meets with Irina and her henchmen for the exchange. He has a gift for his son to give to him upon their reunion. Irina gives him the money but does not bring Michaels son as she had promised to earlier. Michael and Irina were earlier revealed to have a family relationship: the mother of Michaels son is Irinas sister; nonetheless, Irina refers to Michael as a ""monkey."" After being beaten by her henchmen, Michael walks back to his car and triggers a bomb that was wired into his gift, killing Irina and her thugs. As he drives away, Michael is pulled over by Franco, who kills him and steals the money. After investigating Luiss belongings at the morgue, Chris finds a note in Luiss wallet, which contained the location where Marcus took him the day of the shooting. Chris later finds out that Marcus met Luis the day of the shooting, letting him know where to kill Chris. Angered, Chris visits an unconscious Marcus to try to get answers but is interrupted by Franco, who invites Chris back to the station to get his account of the shooting. As the two head to the car, Chris receives a call from Jeffrey, who tells him that Franco has been cleaning house and that he might be next. Chris, clutching his holstered weapon, stops and tells Franco that he’ll meet him at the station. Franco, realizing Chris has been tipped of his involvement, agrees to meet Chris there.

700,701,Trouble with the Curve,2012,/wiki/Trouble_with_the_Curve,"An aging Atlanta Braves baseball scout, Gus Lobel (Eastwood), is given one last assignment to prove his value to the organization, who views him as unable to adapt to changes within the game. His boss and friend Pete (Goodman) does not want to see him let go, but he must contend with an ambitious junior executive, Philip (Lillard), who is trying to get a promotion to the teams general manager post and wants Gus fired as an obstacle to his own baseball philosophy and methods.Pete suspects Gus is hiding problems with his health, so against Guss wishes, Pete contacts Guss daughter Mickey (Adams), a workaholic lawyer pursuing a partnership at her firm, to join her father on a scouting trip to North Carolina. Gus is to review a top prospect named Bo Gentry, a brash amateur whose statistics make him a likely top draft pick.Mickey realizes that Guss vision is failing and starts to take an active role in his work to make up for his shortcoming. Along the way, Gus reconnects with a former player he once scouted,  Johnny ""The Flame"" Flanagan (Timberlake), who is now a scout for the Boston Red Sox, and who takes an interest in Mickey. When Mickey questions Gus about his leaving her with an uncle she barely knew as a child, after her mothers passing, the conversation takes a sour turn, and Mickey storms off, leaving Gus frustrated.As Gus, Mickey and a group of other scouts watch Bo play, Gus and Mickey realize he cant hit a curveball. Gus advises Johnny to pass on Bo in the draft, and Johnny takes his advice. However, when Gus calls Pete and the Braves management with the same advice, Philip disagrees based on statistical analysis and stakes his career on his opinion, leading Braves general manager Vince (Patrick) to draft Bo against Guss advice. When Johnny learns of the move, he believes that Gus and Mickey double-crossed him to allow the Braves to draft Bo instead and angrily leaves.Gus abandons Mickey at the hotel. She hears a pitcher throwing outside her room, and realizes he is talented just from the sound. She approaches the young man, Rigoberto, and volunteers to catch for him. After seeing him throw a few curveballs, she calls Pete, who reluctantly agrees to have him tryout in Atlanta.Gus returns to the Braves office where Vince and Philip criticize him for his evaluation of Bo. Pete interrupts to let them know that Mickey has brought Rigo to the field. As Bo practices batting, Philip mocks Gus and Mickey for bringing in Rigo, an unknown. Mickey insists, however, and Pete allows Rigo to pitch. Rigo throws several fastballs, which Bo repeatedly misses. Mickey calls for Rigo to throw a curve and again Bo cannot connect with the ball, and the staff realize they were wrong about both Bo and Gus.The management resume their meeting, intent on signing Rigo. Gus suggests Mickey could be Rigos sports agent, due to her legal background and knowledge of the game. When Philip makes another snide remark towards Gus, Vince fires him and offers Gus a contract extension. Mickey then gets a partnership offer from her firm. Outside the stadium, Mickey and Gus find Johnny waiting. Mickey approaches him and they kiss while Gus lights a cigar and walks away.",76135364.24,"[{""id"": 18, ""name"": ""Drama""}, {""id"": 10749, ""name"": ""Romance""}]",http://troublewiththecurve.warnerbros.com/,87825,"[{""id"": 515, ""name"": ""women""}, {""id"": 1480, ""name"": ""baseball""}, {""id"": 1484, ""name"": ""pitcher""}, {""id"": 1686, ""name"": ""home run""}, {""id"": 4995, ""name"": ""aging""}, {""id"": 6075, ""name"": ""sport""}, {""id"": 8732, ""name"": ""talent-scout""}, {""id"": 11333, ""name"": ""cigar smoking""}, {""id"": 186903, ""name"": ""poor eyesight""}, {""id"": 186906, ""name"": ""boston red sox""}, {""id"": 186908, ""name"": ""draft""}, {""id"": 200574, ""name"": ""motel room""}, {""id"": 229043, ""name"": ""baseball scout""}, {""id"": 229046, ""name"": ""failing eyesight""}, {""id"": 229049, ""name"": ""blurry vision""}, {""id"": 229050, ""name"": ""blurred sight""}]",en,"Slowed by age and failing eyesight, crack baseball scout Gus Lobel takes his grown daughter along as he checks out the final prospect of his career.

701,702,True Grit,2010,/wiki/True_Grit_(2010_film),"Mattie Rosss father was murdered by Tom Chaney when she was 14 years old. While collecting her fathers body in Fort Smith, Arkansas, Mattie asks the local sheriff about the search for Chaney. He tells her that Chaney has fled with ""Lucky"" Ned Pepper and his gang into Indian Territory, where the sheriff has no authority, so she inquires about hiring a Deputy U.S. Marshal. The sheriff gives three recommendations, and Mattie chooses Rooster Cogburn. Cogburn initially rebuffs her offer, not believing she has the money to hire him, but she raises the money by aggressively horse-trading with Colonel Stonehill.Texas Ranger LaBoeuf arrives in town, pursuing Chaney for the murder of a Texas State Senator. LaBoeuf proposes joining Cogburn, but Mattie refuses his offer. She wishes Chaney to be hanged in Arkansas for her fathers murder, not in Texas for killing the senator. Mattie also insists on traveling with Cogburn but he leaves without her, having gone with LaBoeuf to apprehend Chaney and split the reward.After being refused passage on the ferry that conveyed Cogburn and LaBoeuf, Mattie crosses the river on horseback. LaBoeuf expresses his displeasure by spanking Mattie with a stick, but Cogburn eventually allows Mattie to accompany them. After a dispute over their respective service with the Confederate Army, Cogburn ends their arrangement and LaBoeuf leaves to pursue Chaney on his own. Cogburn and Mattie meet a trail doctor who directs them to an empty dugout for shelter. They find two outlaws, Quincy and Moon, and interrogate them. Quincy insists they have no information about the Pepper gang, but eventually Moon divulges what he knows; Quincy fatally stabs Moon, and Cogburn shoots Quincy dead. Before dying, Moon says Pepper and his gang will be returning for fresh horses that night.LaBoeuf arrives at the dugout and is confronted by the Pepper gang. Cogburn, hiding on the hillside with Mattie, shoots two gang members and accidentally hits LaBoeuf, but Pepper escapes. However, Cogburn and LaBoeuf argue the next day, and the latter departs again. While retrieving water from a stream, Mattie encounters Chaney. She shoots him, but he survives and drags her back to Pepper, who forces Cogburn to leave by threatening to kill her. Pepper leaves Mattie alone with Chaney, ordering him not to harm her or he will not get paid after his remount arrives.Chaney tries to knife Mattie, but LaBoeuf appears and knocks Chaney out. They watch from a distance as Cogburn fights the remaining members of Peppers gang, killing two and wounding Ned before his horse is shot and falls, trapping his leg, whereupon LaBoeuf snipes Pepper. Chaney regains consciousness and knocks out LaBoeuf, but Mattie seizes LaBoeufs rifle and shoots Chaney in the chest. The recoil knocks her into a deep pit, where she is bitten by a rattlesnake. Cogburn cuts into her hand to suck out as much of the venom as he can, then rides day and night to reach a doctor, carrying her on foot after her horse collapses from exhaustion.Matties left forearm is amputated due to gangrene from the snakebite. Cogburn stays until she is out of danger, but leaves before she regains consciousness. She never sees Cogburn or LaBoeuf again, despite writing a letter inviting Cogburn to collect the money she owed him. Twenty-five years later, she receives a note from Cogburn inviting her to a travelling Wild West show  where he now performs. She arrives, only to learn that he died three days earlier. She has his body moved to her family cemetery.

His obsession with speed has made him an outcast in the slow and cautious snail community, and a constant embarrassment to his older brother, Chet. Theo wanders onto a freeway to admire the traffic and wishes upon a star that he was fast. Suddenly, he is sucked into the supercharger of a drag racer, fusing his DNA with nitrous oxide. When he wakes up, he possesses great speed and accuracy, and some characteristics of a real car. Unfortunately, his first attempt to show this power off ends with him crashing a tricycle into the garden, getting himself and Chet fired from the garden crew.As the siblings quarrel over Theos problems, Chet is snatched by a crow, but is pursued and rescued by Theo at a run-down strip mall called Starlight Plaza. There, they are captured by Tito, a taco truck driver, and are brought to a snail race held by him and his co-workers. Theo astounds both humans and snails alike, earns the respect of the snails, led by Whiplash, and renames himself ""Turbo"". Tito dreams of reviving the strip mall with Turbo as an attraction, and eventually manages to divert and strand a tour bus, bringing impressive business. At this success, Turbo convinces Tito to enter him in the Indianapolis 500 as a competitor. The neighbors agree to put up the entrance fee and accompany them to Indianapolis.Tito is initially refused entry into the race, but a chance meeting with Guy Gagné gives Turbo a chance to show off his speed, astounding the audience and the racers by qualifying for the race. This impossible feat soon becomes a sensation on social media and the CEO gives in to let the snail compete. Turbo enters the race the next day, but the dangerous racetrack and the more experienced competitors leave him trailing in last place. At a pitstop, Whiplash and his crew give Turbo a vital pep talk, advising him to stop racing like a car. Turbo uses his small size to his advantage and rapidly gains ground, but Gagné resorts to cheating and knocks Turbo against the circuit wall, damaging his shell and weakening his speed powers.In the final stretch with Turbo in the lead, Gagné desperately causes a crash that snares most of the competitors, including Turbo, who wakes to find his shell punctured and his speed gone. Alarmed at seeing Turbo losing hope, Chet, with a change of heart, braves several dangers to meet with Whiplashs crew and see the racer. Seeing his brother and the crew arrive on crows to encourage him to continue, Turbo resumes the race. Gagné single-mindedly pursues him, dragging his wrecked car, but Turbo narrowly wins and Gagné is disqualified for cheating.Starlight Plaza thrives from Turbos fame; all the businesses become spectacular successes and hold elaborate snail races. Whiplashs crew are given special propulsion aids for their shells, while Chet is content with his new job as the track referee and paramedic.

The pilot, Phil, brings it to a stop at the end of the runway suffering from an exploded tire.As a young Italian-American boy in Torrance, Louie misbehaves by stealing, drinking liquor and smoking. He is often picked on by others due to his Italian ethnicity. His brother Peter sees how fast Louie can run and decides to train him to be a runner. Louie becomes disciplined and becomes a distance runner, earning the nickname ""The Torrance Tornado"". Louie comes in 8th in the 1936 Summer Olympics and sets a record in the final lap for the 5,000-meter race.Returning to 1943, Louie, the surviving crew and several replacements are sent on a search-and-rescue mission with a plane previously used for spare parts. One left engine fails, while the crew bungles the remaining engine, and they crash in the ocean. Louie, Mac, and Phil survive, living on two inflatable rafts. On the 27th day they attract the attention of a Japanese plane, which strafes and damages the rafts but misses them. Mac dies 6 days later. On the 47th day, Japanese sailors capture Louie and Phil. Now, prisoners of war, Louie and Phil are put in a Kwajalein Atoll dungeon. The Japanese ask Louie and Phil for information about E-class bombers and the Norden bombsight. Louie states they flew D-class and draws a rendition of a Philco radio. They are dragged out to disrobe and kneel on planks. Instead of an execution, they are crudely washed to ship them to Japan. Upon arrival, the two are separated and sent to different POW camps.Louies camp, Ōmori, in Tokyo, is headed by Japanese corporal Mutsuhiro Watanabe who is especially tough on Louie, beating him often. Louie is given an opportunity to broadcast a message home saying he is alive after learning the US government classified him as KIA.

704,705,Underworld: Awakening,2012,/wiki/Underworld:_Awakening,"A few years after the events of the second film, both the government and the general public have become aware of the existence of the Vampires and Lycans. A program to study and potentially harness their powers soon escalates into an all-out genocide and shortly after the ""Purge"" begins, Selene and Michael are captured by humans. Due to her enhanced vampiric traits, Selene is imprisoned in cryogenic suspension.After being frozen for twelve years, during which both species have been hunted to the brink of extinction, Selene manages to escape. She learns that another subject, whom she initially believes to be Michael, has also escaped. While making her way through the high-tech facility, Selene has visions from someone elses point of view. Believing that Michael is mentally guiding her, she follows the visions, which lead her down a garbage chute into a labyrinthine series of basement tunnels. Here she encounters a young vampire named David, who has been tracking her. They quickly realize that the tunnels are infested with sick and weakened Lycans, who are hunting the subject Selene is connected with. Determined to reach Michael, Selene fights her way through the Lycan pack until she reaches the second escapee: not Michael, but a frightened and confused young girl.Using Davids van, Selene, David and the girl make their way out of the facility, only to be attacked once again by a trio of Lycans. David stabs a Lycan while Selene shoots another; the third smashes its way into the rear of the vehicle, where it bites the girl’s shoulder. This triggers a partial transformation, revealing her hybrid traits, as she savagely rips the creatures head in half. Selene realizes this is her and Michaels daughter. The girl reveals that during her own escape from the facility, she found Selenes cryogenic tank and deactivated it, which was what allowed Selene to escape. However, despite her hybrid nature it becomes apparent that her bite wound is not healing and she is rapidly growing weaker, resulting in David agreeing to take the pair to his coven.After she reluctantly drinks some blood, her wound heals, but as they do not feel welcome in the coven, Selene prepares to leave. David tries to convince her to stay and help them start an offensive against the humans by training some Death Dealers, but before she makes up her mind, the coven comes under attack by Lycans. Selene joins the fight and kills many Lycans before being knocked unconscious by a huge ""Super-Lycan"" that heals instantly and is not affected by silver. When she awakens later she finds that Thomas, Davids father, has surrendered her daughter to the Lycans in return for them leaving. David has been mortally wounded in the battle, but Selene revives him with her blood. After leaving, Selene confronts a human detective named Sebastian, who is sympathetic to the vampires due to his now dead wife being a vampire. Sebastian confirms that the Lycans have been traced to Antigen, the corporation dedicated to killing off the immortal species, and which also runs the facility from which Selene has escaped.Selene discovers that Antigen is actually run by Lycans, who have been posing as humans in order to trick the worlds governments into believing the Lycans are extinct. The director of Antigen, Dr. Jacob Lane, is trying to perfect the Lycan race and needs the DNA of Selene’s daughter to do so. The ""Super-Lycan"" Selene faced earlier is identified as Quint – Lanes son and the prototype for Lycan modifications. Selene and Sebastian infiltrate Antigen to stop Lanes plan and save Selene’s daughter, who they begin calling “Eve.” Selene comes across Subject 0, whom she identifies as Michael, and attempts to free him by shooting his cryogenic tank. However, she is forced to leave the thawing Michael in order to stop the Lycans from escaping with Eve. David, who since being healed by her blood has inherited Selenes immunity to sunlight, arrives and helps Sebastian kill several Lycan henchmen. After confronting Lane and Quint, Selene fights Quint. Once she tricks him into returning to his more vulnerable human form by hiding in a narrow tunnel, Selene kills him by implanting a silver grenade in his stomach, while Eve kills Lane by ripping out his throat. As the police arrive, Sebastian urges the vampires to flee and distracts the officers. Selene, Eve, and David return to Michaels tank and find it empty with the ice shattered. Selene states that the world will be hunting Michael and the trio vow to find him first.",70000000,"[{""id"": 14, ""name"": ""Fantasy""}, {""id"": 28, ""name"": ""Action""}, {""id"": 27, ""name"": ""Horror""}]",http://www.entertheunderworld.com/,52520,"[{""id"": 3133, ""name"": ""vampire""}, {""id"": 5600, ""name"": ""daughter""}, {""id"": 9410, ""name"": ""hybrid""}, {""id"": 9668, ""name"": ""child vampire""}, {""id"": 12564, ""name"": ""werewolf""}, {""id"": 156395, ""name"": ""imax""}, {""id"": 176729, ""name"": ""lab experiment""}, {""id"": 180084, ""name"": ""werewolf child""}, {""id"": 231407, ""name"": ""fang vamp""}]",en,"After being held in a coma-like state for fifteen years, vampire Selene learns that she has a fourteen-year-old vampire/Lycan hybrid daughter named Nissa, and when she finds her, they must stop BioCom from creating super Lycans that will kill them all.",58.401204,"[{""name"": ""Lakeshore Entertainment"", ""id"": 126}, {""name"": ""Saturn Films"", ""id"": 831}, {""name"": ""Screen Gems"", ""id"": 3287}, {""name"": ""Sketch Films"", ""id"": 7738}, {""name"": ""UW4 Productions"", ""id"": 7740}]","[{""iso_3166_1"": ""US"", ""name"": ""United States of America""}]",1/19/2012,160112671,88,"[{""iso_639_1"": ""en"", ""name"": ""English""}, {""iso_639_1"": ""ru"", ""name"": ""P\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439""}]",Released,Vengeance Returns,Underworld: Awakening,6.1,1862,0.24928391,0.5,0.16832155,0.5,-0.33167845,0.33167845,-0.25071609,0.304690997,2.287323871

Jürgen soon deduces that Cole is a former mercenary and member of the group; knowing Cole is there to interrogate and kill him and with no way of escape, Jürgen commits suicide to protect Harris.After retrieving his briefcase, Harris parts ways with Gina. When she sees him kidnapped by Cole and Jones, she steals a taxi and follows them. When Harris awakes, Cole explains that ""Martin Harris"" is just a cover name created by Harris and Liz was his professional teammate. His head injury caused him to believe the persona was real; when Liz notified Cole of the injury, ""Harris"" was activated as his replacement. He continues to explain Harris is a trained assassin that they have to eliminate.  Gina drives up in time to save Harris, running over Jones before he can kill Harris, then rams the van Cole is in over a railing, killing him as well. During the commotion, Harris finds a hidden compartment in his briefcase containing two Canadian passports, remembering that he and Liz were in Berlin three months prior to plant a bomb in Prince Shadas suite.Now aware of his own role in the assassination plot, Martin seeks to redeem himself by thwarting it. Hotel security immediately hold Martin and Gina, but Martin proves his earlier visit to the hotel. After being convinced of the bombs presence, security evacuates the hotel.Harris realizes that Prince Shada is not Section 15s target, but rather Bressler, who has developed a genetically modified breed of corn capable of surviving harsh climates. Knowing with Bresslers death and the theft of his research, his findings would be worth billions of dollars should they fall into the wrong hands.Liz, who previously accessed Bresslers laptop and stole the data; tells ""Harris"" to complete their mission in getting rid of Bressler, while she disarms the bomb they no longer need. Unable to disarm it in time, Liz is blown up.During the evacuation, Harris stops ""Harris"", from killing Bressler, killing ""Harris"", the last remaining Section 15 assassin. Gina finds Harris and they escape during the aftermath of the bombing.  As the bombing is identified as a failed assassination of the Prince Shada, Bressler announces he is making his corn available to the world for free.  As the announcement is televised, Harris and Gina board a train together with new identities.",30000000,"[{""id"": 28, ""name"": ""Action""}, {""id"": 9648, ""name"": ""Mystery""}, {""id"": 53, ""name"": ""Thriller""}]",http://unknownmovie.warnerbros.com/,48138,"[{""id"": 444, ""name"": ""taxi""}, {""id"": 612, ""name"": ""hotel""}, {""id"": 732, ""name"": ""coma""}, {""id"": 1749, ""name"": ""taxi driver""}, {""id"": 3071, ""name"": ""prince""}, {""id"": 11435, ""name"": ""briefcase""}, {""id"": 11612, ""name"": ""hospital""}, {""id"": 155751, ""name"": ""stolen identity""}]",en,"An American biologist attending a conference in Berlin awakens from a coma after a car accident, only to discover that someone has taken his identity and that no one, not even his wife, believes him.

Intending suicide, she takes an overdose, blaming her attempted suicide on the failure of the world to recognize what is ""real"". She wakes inside an exclusive and expensive mental asylum only to learn that the overdose has left her prone to an aneurysm that will kill her in a matter of weeks. At first, Veronika wants only to accelerate the process, and even a visit by her adoptive parents fails to rekindle her will to live. Her parents love her, but while they are prepared to spend their dwindling resources to get her what help they can (not knowing her death is imminent anyway), they dont truly understand her. They discouraged her from accepting a full musical scholarship at Juilliard because they wanted her to get a degree that could earn her a living. They do not see how she despairs at their constraints.In spite of herself and in spite of her disappointment with her materialistic life, Veronika finds renewed purpose through playing the asylums piano and through observing and then connecting with the schizophrenic Edward (Jonathan Tucker). Not only does she recover her own will to live, Veronika helps Edward come out of his catatonic state, and the pair soon escape (Dr Blake, looking out his window, observes them escaping, but doesnt send for anyone to bring them back) from the asylum together, determined to enjoy Veronikas final days as a couple.Veronika does not know that her aneurysm is the invention of her unorthodox psychiatrist Dr. Blake (David Thewlis), who is testing his theory that convincing her she has only weeks to live will restore her to health and cure her desire to commit suicide. He explains his treatment through letter to his estranged wife, a colleague from the asylum. Most people who attempt suicide repeat their attempts until successful. As long as she does not know the truth, he theorizes, she will consider each day as if it might be her last and thus treasure it. This is, he notes, actually true, as nobody knows when their end will come.When Veronika drifts off one morning on a bench at sunrise, Edward believes he has lost her, but his grief transforms to joy when she wakes.

Impressed by the hunchbacks vast knowledge of human anatomy, acquired from stolen books, Victor rescues him, drains the cyst on his back that causes his physical abnormality and gives him a harness to improve his posture – he then names him ""Igor Straussman"" after his roommate who is not often at home. The two then become partners in Victors ongoing experiments to create life through artificial means, incurring the wrath of devoutly religious police inspector Roderick Turpin, who views their experiments as sinful.When Victor shows Igor his use of electricity to animate eyes, Igor suggests he made mistakes attaching the nerves, leading Victor to ask Igor to perform the surgical parts of his experiment. Victor procures parts from dead animals and makes Igor restore the organs, which Victor secretly uses to create a monstrous chimpanzee-esque creature nicknamed ""Gordon"".Igor reunites with Lorelei, now masquerading as the mistress of a closeted homosexual baron, upsetting Victor, who views Lorelei as a distraction. Igor invites Lorelei to a demonstration of their experiment, which goes awry when Gordon escapes and wreaks havoc through the university before being killed by Victor and Igor. Lorelei is horrified by Victors experiments and urges Igor to dissuade him from pursuing the matter further, but Igor is reluctant to do so upon learning that Victor is driven by the need to atone for his indirect role in the death of his older brother, Henry, for which Victors domineering father blames Victor.Victor is expelled from college for his unorthodox methods, but attracts the attention of his wealthy, arrogant classmate Finnegan, who wants him to create an artificial humanoid creature.

Victor is initially ecstatic that the experiment has worked, sharing a brief moment with Prometheus, thinking him to be his resurrected brother Henry. Victor quickly realizes that the experiment has failed: Prometheus has no consciousness and can not talk. The shocked Turpin opens fire on Prometheus, who goes into a rage, killing Turpin and nearly killing Victor. Disillusioned, Victor joins forces with Igor to kill Prometheus by stabbing its two hearts.After regaining consciousness the next morning, Igor reunites with Lorelei, who hands him a letter written to him by Victor, in which Victor apologizes for all the suffering he caused and recognizes Igor was his ""greatest creation"".

709,710,Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps,2010,/wiki/Wall_Street:_Money_Never_Sleeps,"In 2001, Gordon Gekko is released from prison after serving time for insider trading and securities fraud.In 2008, Gekko is promoting his new book Is Greed Good?, warning about a coming economic downturn. His estranged daughter, Winnie, runs a small, non-profit news website and is dating Jacob Moore, a top trader at Keller Zabel Investments (KZI). Jacob, a protégé of KZI managing director Louis Zabel, has been raising money for Dr. Masters and his fusion research project, which might create abundant clean energy. Jake is also financially assisting his mother, Sylvia, who has quit nursing to speculate in residential real estate.In the early stages of the downturn predicted by Gekko, KZIs stock loses more than 50% of its value. Louis Zabel tries to arrange a bailout for KZI from other Wall Street banks but is blocked by Bretton James, head of rival firm Churchill Schwartz (Church), which KZI had refused to help during the dot-com bubble years earlier. Despondent, Zabel commits suicide by jumping in front of a subway train. A distraught Jacob proposes marriage to Winnie, who accepts.Jacob attends a lecture given by Gekko and introduces himself. Gekko tells him that KZIs collapse started when Bretton spread rumors of KZI having toxic debt. Jacob and Gekko arrange a trade: Jacob will try to reconcile Winnies and Gekkos relationship, and Gekko will gather information to destroy Bretton for his actions against KZI and for providing evidence against Gekko years ago. In revenge, Jake illegally manipulates the market by spreading rumors about the nationalization of a foreign oil field which Church has invested in. The company loses $120 million, but Bretton gives Jake a job, impressed by his initiative. Jake further impresses Bretton when he convinces Chinese investors to invest in the fusion project through Church.Jake attends a $10,000-a-seat fundraiser with Winnie, buying a seat for Gekko to facilitate a ""chance"" meeting. Gekko confronts Bretton about what he did to him and to KZI. Bretton replies that no one cares what Gekko thinks anymore. Gekko also bumps into Bud Fox (Charlie Sheen), and they discuss their shared experience going to jail. Gekko follows Winnie outside, where she explains why she blames him for everything that went wrong, stemming from his affairs and her brother Rudys suicide. Gekko claims he worked, from prison, to get the best therapists and even paid off a drug dealer to stop selling to Rudy, who died from an overdose. Winnie forgives him.As the financial crisis accelerates, Bretton and Churchill Schwartzs Chairman Julius Steinhardt advise federal regulators to buy their multi billion-dollar subprime loans. As real estate collapses, Jake helps out Sylvia with his own money. Shortly after Winnie informs Jake that she is expecting their first child, Jake learns that Bretton is diverting the Chinese investment into underperforming solar panels, which are not a threat to his large position in fossil fuels.  Gekko soon informs Jake that Bretton had secretly made huge profits betting against subprime loans yet still accepted the feds massive bailout.Gekko proposes using a $100 million trust fund account, which he hid in Switzerland for Winnie in the 1980s, to fund the fusion research. She signs the money over to Jake, not knowing he would entrust it to Gekko to complete the investment. When Gekko betrays them by leaving the country with the money, Winnie breaks up with Jake. Gekko sets up a hugely successful investment company in London, capitalized by the $100 million. Jake visits him to propose a new trade: Winnie gets her money back, and Gekko can participate in his grandchilds life. Gekko refuses.Jake pieces together all the details of Brettons dealings, from KZIs collapse through to his unnecessary government bailout of Brettons company.  He gives the information to Winnie, telling her that revealing it will bring her website publicity and credibility. When Winnie runs the story, Bretton finds himself under intense government scrutiny and is fired by his companys board, who then turn to Gekkos firm for a partnership, which recently posted a $1.1 billion return on investment.Jake has successfully reunited with Winnie in New York, when late one night Gekko appears, apologizes and tells them that he has anonymously deposited $100 million into the fusion research account.

With both out of work, they are forced to sell their apartment and drive to Atlanta to live with Georges arrogant brother Rick and his wife Marisa after Rick offers George a job.After many hours on the highway, Linda demands they stop to rest. The closest place to stop appears to be a bed and breakfast hotel named Elysium. After exiting the highway, as they approach, they are surprised to see a naked man walking ahead of them. He approaches them. Startled and apprehensive, George tries to back up to the highway, but accidentally flips the car over. The nude man, Wayne Davidson, helps them out of the car, and they are forced to stay at the hotel. They meet several colorful guests, and then go to bed. While trying to sleep, they are distracted by noises downstairs. When they go to investigate, they learn that Elysium is a hippie commune. They meet various eccentric residents of Elysium, including Seth, Eva, and Elysiums owner Carvin. George and Linda spend the night feeling more alive than before. In the morning, everyone helps flip the car back upright so they can leave, as Seth urges them to stay, but they continue on to Atlanta.George and Linda arrive at Ricks house and find the atmosphere chaotic. George quickly reaches a breaking point with Rick and takes Linda back to Elysium, where they are welcomed back. George is excited about the simpler lifestyle while Linda is hesitant. They decide to stay and give the place a two-week trial run. After a few days, Linda starts feeling enlightened after drinking some drug laced tea in the truth circle, while George begins having second thoughts. George and Linda soon learn that free love is strongly encouraged as Seth and Eva want to seduce Linda and George, respectively. Both George and Linda rebuff the notion of free love, and several crazy situations arise during that period, bizarre and otherwise.At the same time, Elysium is being targeted by property developers to build a casino on the property, as title to the property is disputed, and Carvin has misplaced the deed to the land. After the developers arrive with a bulldozer, to make a TV reporting-crew take more interest, Linda scares them off by flashing them her breasts, and many of the other residents join her, which gets sensationalized coverage, and halts the proceeding. Linda is lauded as a hero by the commune. The two weeks are up, and George demands that they leave, saying that if they stay, they would have to give in to free love. Linda wants to stay and has sex with Seth. George is pressured to have sex with Eva, but he becomes uncomfortable and drives her away with his awkward and bizarre behavior. The next morning, George reaches a breaking point, again, stating that he dislikes the rules of Elysium and wants to leave. Linda wants to stay, so George goes back to Ricks house alone.Seth believes he has found his soul mate in Linda and searches for the deed to Elysium, which he finds and sells to the property developers, for $11,000, to start a new life with Linda, betraying the commune. A child from the commune witnesses the burning of the deed by Seth and the man that wants to build the casino. Seth tells Linda he wants them to leave Elysium behind, together, and that the others can look after themselves. Linda refuses.In the meantime, George realizes he loves Linda and comes back to find her, getting into a fight with Seth while the commune looks on and tries to help non-violently.

When the orcs arrive on Azeroth, Guldan assists Draka with giving birth, but while the baby is born alive, it is in neonatal distress, struggling to breathe, and is near death. Guldan then drains the life out of a nearby deer to revive and infuse fel magic into the baby, which Durotan later names Goel.The orcs raid several settlements throughout Azeroth. Anduin Lothar, the military commander of the human forces in the Stormwind Kingdom, looks over some of the men that were killed, and finds a trespassing mage named Khadgar, who explains that he was investigating the dead bodies because they contained traces of fel magic. Khadgar persuades Stormwinds king, Llane Wrynn, to consult Medivh, the renowned Guardian of Tirisfal, and Llane sends Anduin and Khadgar to Medivhs stronghold, Karazhan, to inform him of the fel magics presence on Azeroth. In the Karazhan library, a ghostly shadow leads Khadgar to a mysterious book, which he takes.Anduin, Khadgar, and Medivh join a scouting team following traces of fel magic but are ambushed by orcs. Medivh uses a spell to kill the fel-corrupted orcs, leaving the Hordes warchief, Blackhand, to flee along with Durotan and Orgrim. Khadgar restrains a half-orc slave, Garona, and the soldiers take her prisoner. King Llane frees Garona in exchange for loyalty to Stormwind, and she leads the humans to spy on the orc camp, where they learn of Guldans plan to bring the Horde to Azeroth. Meanwhile, Durotan realizes that the fel magic is responsible for the destruction of Draenor, and if Guldan is not thwarted, Azeroth will suffer the same fate. Despite Orgrims objections, Durotan invites Llane to a secret meeting so that the Frostwolf Clan and the humans can unite to defeat Guldan. While studying the book that he took from Karazhan, Khadgar learns that Guldan could not have opened the portal on his own; he had help from someone on Azeroth. He is confronted by Medivh, who burns Khadgars research when Khadgar offers to help him with his work.The Frostwolf Clan meets with the humans to negotiate an alliance, but the group is ambushed by Blackhand. As the humans retreat, Medivh forms a magical barrier to protect them, but Lothars son Callan is separated from the rest of the group and killed by Blackhand. Medivh is severely weakened, and Garona and Khadgar take him back to Karazhan to recover. After noticing Medivhs eyes shine green, showing that he is infected by fel magic, Khadgar returns to his former home, Dalaran, to seek help from the Kirin Tor, the authority of human and high elven mages. The Kirin Tor facilitate a meeting with Alodi, revealed to be the shadow who led Khadgar to the book; she confirms that Medivh has indeed been corrupted by fel magic and turned into a demon. At the orc camp, Blackhand purges the Frostwolf Clan. Orgrim helps Draka to escape, and she sends Goel down a river in a basket, but is then found and killed by another orc. Durotan challenges Guldan to Makgora, a traditional orcish duel to the death for leadership of a clan – in this case, all of the orcs. During the fight, Guldan violates the honorable combat rules by draining the life out of Durotan with his magic, killing him and earning the disapproval of the orcs watching, and he empowers Blackhand with the same magic. Medivh, now in a half-demonic state, starts to open the portal to Draenor, and Guldan begins sacrificing the captured human villagers to allow the rest of the Horde to enter Azeroth.Llane leads the human army in an assault on the orc camp, while Anduin and Khadgar fight Medivh and destroy the demon that had begun to manifest on the outside. Medivh is left mortally wounded, and uses the last of his strength to close the portal to Draenor and instead open a portal to Stormwind, allowing Llane to evacuate most of the freed prisoners. When Medivh eventually dies, the portal closes, leaving Llane, Garona and a small number of human soldiers to fight the orcs. Llane secretly orders Garona to kill him, bringing her honor among the orcs and putting her in a position of power to bring peace between the two races. Garona reluctantly does so and is welcomed into the Horde by Guldan. As the orcs celebrate, Lothar arrives to retrieve King Llanes body and discovers Garonas knife still in Llanes neck, realizing that it was she who had killed their king. Blackhand challenges Lothar to Makgora, and Lothar quickly disposes of him. Against Guldans demands, the orcs, bound by tradition, allow Lothar to depart with Llanes body. At Llanes funeral in Stormwind, the leaders of the other human nations, along with the high elves and dwarves, proclaim an alliance against the orcs and rally behind Lothar as the leader of the Alliance forces. Elsewhere, Orgrim takes one of Durotans tusks to one day give to Goel, and the basket containing Goel is found by a human.",160000000,"[{""id"": 28, ""name"": ""Action""}, {""id"": 12, ""name"": ""Adventure""}, {""id"": 14, ""name"": ""Fantasy""}]",http://www.warcraft-themovie.com/,68735,"[{""id"": 282, ""name"": ""video game""}, {""id"": 603, ""name"": ""elves""}, {""id"": 606, ""name"": ""orcs""}, {""id"": 2343, ""name"": ""magic""}, {""id"": 3713, ""name"": ""chase""}, {""id"": 9717, ""name"": ""based on comic book""}, {""id"": 10821, ""name"": ""sorcerer""}, {""id"": 14946, ""name"": ""fictional war""}, {""id"": 41645, ""name"": ""based on video game""}, {""id"": 177912, ""name"": ""wizard""}, {""id"": 189113, ""name"": ""fictional language""}, {""id"": 211674, ""name"": ""muscles""}, {""id"": 228295, ""name"": ""orc""}, {""id"": 234213, ""name"": ""sword and sorcery""}]",en,"The peaceful realm of Azeroth stands on the brink of war as its civilization faces a fearsome race of invaders: orc warriors fleeing their dying home to colonize another.

712,713,Warrior,2011,/wiki/Warrior_(2011_film),"U.S. Marine Tommy Riordan (Tom Hardy) visits his father, Paddy Conlon (Nick Nolte), a recovering alcoholic who has returned to his Catholic faith. Tommy had to run away from Paddy with his dying mother when he was just a boy due to Paddy having previously been an abusive alcoholic, and has never quite forgiven him. Paddy tries to convince him that he has changed, but to no avail. The next day, Tommy enters a gym where, in less than a minute, he beats unconscious a professional fighter named Pete ""Mad Dog"" Grimes (Erik Apple), in a fight which is filmed with a cell phone and later uploaded to the internet, where it goes viral. Tommy learns about a winner-takes-all mixed martial arts tournament called Sparta in which the winner will receive $5 million. Tommy asks Paddy to help him train for the tournament, but only under the condition that Paddy does not try to reconcile their relationship.Meanwhile, Tommys older brother, Brendan (Joel Edgerton), a high school physics teacher and former MMA fighter, is struggling to provide for his wife Tess (Jennifer Morrison) and two daughters. He had to mortgage his house to pay for his younger daughters open heart surgery, and is now in danger of losing everything. To increase his income, Brendan battles amateur fighters for money. Rumors of Brendans secret life spread around the school, and the superintendent suspends him without pay. Later that night, Paddy comes over to meet up with Brendan in his driveway to try to reconcile with him, but to no avail. Before Paddy leaves, he tells Brendan that Tommy is back in town. Left with no other option, Brendan seeks the training of old friend Frank Campana (Frank Grillo) and begins competing in smaller venue fights. After the fighter Frank planned to enter into the Sparta tournament is injured, Brendan convinces Frank to enter him as a replacement. After arriving at the tournament, Brendan discovers that Tommy has also entered. It is revealed that Tommy is still angry at Brendan for staying behind for Tess when Tommy and their mother left Paddy; Tommy was left to care for their mother when she became terminally ill. Brendan claims that he could not help having been in love with Tess and that he has forgiven his father for the wrong he has done, but Tommy is unconvinced.Meanwhile, the video of Tommy beating ""Mad Dog"" attracts the attention of a Marine whose life Tommy saved in Iraq. The Marine tells the press about Tommys heroism, and Tommy becomes a national hero. However, Tommys records surface from the Corps and reveal that he deserted the military after his entire unit was killed in a friendly fire bombing. Tommy had been using his mothers maiden name as his own surname in order to evade arrest for his desertion. He reveals to have pledged to give his winnings to the widow of one of his fallen friends. The military police will take him into custody after the tournament is over.Over two nights, Brendan and Tommy have contrasting fortunes: Tommy quickly and brutally knocks out opponents, while Brendan is outmatched physically but utilizes Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu to force grappling submissions.  In the semi-final match, Brendan is matched up with undefeated Russian wrestler Koba (Kurt Angle), who dominates him in two rounds. In round three, Brendan swings for the fences, making the bout a back and forth battle. In the closing moments of the final round, Koba takes Brendans back from the clinch and Brendan goes for a rolling kneebar. As Koba attempts to escape the position, Brendan quickly reverses and readjusts the kneebar narrowly winning by submission. Tommy meets Mad Dog Grimes in the semifinals, and Tommy once again knocks him unconscious almost immediately.The night before the final day, Paddy attempts to talk to Tommy about his actions in Iraq. Tommy angrily dismisses his father, who relapses and starts drinking again. Seeing his terrible pain, Tommy calms and comforts him. In the end the brothers are the last fighters remaining in the tournament, and despite Brendans desire to reconcile, Tommy shows no interest in doing so. Tommy wins the first two rounds, but Brendan eventually dislocates Tommys shoulder with an omoplata arm-lock. As the fourth round starts, Brendan insists Tommy give up as Tommy only has use of one arm. As Tommy continues trying to knock Brendan out, Brendan unloads a barrage of strikes trying to end the fight. Tommy goads Brendan to continue hitting him as the fourth round ends. At the start of Round 5, Brendan refuses to fight, but Tommy persists. Brendan realizes he has to force him to submit, and he traps Tommy in a rear naked choke. As they struggle on the canvas, Brendan apologizes to Tommy and tells him that he loves him. After some hesitation Tommy submits.

The two strike up a conversation and Jacob reveals he had a career in the circus business and was present during one of the most infamous circus disasters of all time, equal in seriousness to the 1944 Hartford circus fire and the Hagenbeck-Wallace Circus wreck.Jankowski tells his story to OBrien, starting in 1931 when he was a 23-year-old veterinary medicine student at Cornell University. During his final exam, he is informed that his parents were killed in a car accident. His father has left huge debts, and the bank was foreclosing on Jacobs home. Feeling there is no point in returning to school, and having no home to go to, he jumps onto a passing train where he meets a kind old man named Camel.Jacob wakes up the next morning and discovers that he jumped on the Benzini Bros. circus train. He sees a beautiful young woman named Marlena Rosenbluth, and meets August, the circuss ringmaster, head animal trainer, and Marlenas husband. Jacob reveals he studied veterinary science and August hires Jacob as a vet for the circus animals after Jacob tells August that Silver (a show horse) has laminitis.August instructs Jacob to fix Silver and keep him performing as long as possible. But Jacob cannot bear to see Silvers suffering and takes it upon himself to tell Marlena and shoots Silver.  August is furious with Jacobs decision to euthanize Silver against orders. To show Jacob who is boss, he threatens to throw him off the moving train — telling him that an animals suffering is nothing compared to a mans, and that Jacob must carry out all of Augusts future orders if he wishes to keep his job.August eventually procures Rosie the elephant as Silvers replacement. He invites Jacob to his car for dinner and cocktails with him and Marlena. Jacob watches the married couple flirt and dance in front of him, but it becomes clear that their relationship is complicated because August is possessive, jealous and rough with Marlena.In the next few weeks, August becomes frustrated when Rosie seems impossible to train. August is brutal with Rosie, beating her with a bullhook when she fails to follow orders. After a brutal beating that August gave to Rosie when she ran away after fleeing from the event and dropping Marlena, Jacob realizes that the elephant only understands Polish commands. After that, Rosie performs beautifully and the circus enjoys a short period of success. While working together to train Rosie, Jacob and Marlena fall in love. After August discovers this, he cruelly taunts the two. Marlena discovers that August plans to throw Jacob from the train and they run away together, hiding in a local hotel. Soon after consummating their relationship, they are ambushed by Augusts henchmen who drag Marlena away and beat up Jacob.Jacob returns to the circus to find Marlena. Marlena tells Jacob that his friends Walter and Camel were thrown from the train and killed. Several circus employees have become fed up with Augusts murderous cruelty and unleash their revenge by unlocking all the animals cages while the big top tent is jam-packed with an audience enjoying Marlena and Rosies performance.  Jacob attempts to find Marlena in the chaos and August attacks him. When Marlena tries to stop August from beating Jacob, he turns his fury on her and chokes her, while one of Augusts henchmen beats Jacob. Wade and Grady, two of Jacobs best friends and one of the circus workers save Jacob and he sees Rosie hit August on the back of the head with an iron stake, killing him. As a result, Benzini Bros. is officially shut down, and no one is charged with releasing the animals.Back in the present, Jacob explains to OBrien in flashbacks that he returned to Cornell and finished his degree. He and Marlena took several horses and Rosie, and got jobs with the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus. Jacob worked as a veterinarian and she continued to perform with Rosie.

He tours many houses with his 7-year-old daughter, Rosie, and his realtor, Mr. Stevens, but finds none he likes until his daughter finds a listing with what seems like the perfect house. They drive to an old large house and Benjamin inspects the property, telling his realtor it is perfect. When they hear a lion roar, Stevens explains that the house comes with a zoo in the back, which closed several years before; if they want the house, they must buy the zoo.Mee eventually decides to buy the zoo when he sees Rosie happily playing with the peacocks. Dylan, however, hates the idea of moving away from his friends and retreats into his artwork which has grown more macabre since the death of his mother. Benjamins brother, Duncan, tries to dissuade him from the purchase, but Benjamin buys it anyway. The zoo staff, led by the 28-year-old head keeper, Kelly Foster, help to start renovating the zoo with the intent to reopen it to the public. When Kelly confronts Benjamin about why he bought a zoo, knowing nothing about running one, Benjamin simply responds, ""Why not?"" Dylan befriends Kellys 13-year-old homeschooled cousin, Lily Miska, who develops a romantic interest that Dylan is oblivious to.A strict USDA inspector, Walter Ferris, arrives for a surprise inspection and makes a list of repairs that would cost around $100,000, which Benjamin does not have. Rhonda Blair, the zoos accountant, gossips that Benjamin will probably sell the zoo. The workers morale sinks, fearing the property will be sold to a buyer that will close it down.When Lily tells Dylan that she heard his family might be leaving, he is overjoyed, which hurts her feelings. Benjamin discovers that his wife bequeathed him an investment account, with instructions to use the money wisely while listening to his heart. Duncan advises him to walk away and start over with the money, but Benjamin decides to use the money to repair the zoo. While this lifts the zoo workers morale, Dylan is unhappy about having to stay; he confronts his father, and a heated argument ensues. They reconcile the next morning and Dylan admits he misses Lily. Benjamin gives his son advice using his favorite principle, that you only need 20 seconds of courage to achieve great things. Benjamin realizes that instead of trying to start over by forgetting his wife, he should accept that she will always be a part of him.Prior to the grand opening of the zoo, the facility passes a very stringent inspection from Ferris, who grudgingly wishes them good luck. Dylan, following his fathers advice, confesses to Lily that he loves her and she forgives him. The week prior to the opening, the worst rainstorm in 100 years is predicted to wash it out. The weather clears in time, but in the morning they are disappointed when no visitors arrive. They discover that a fallen tree has blocked the access road, with a large crowd of waiting visitors behind it. The staff help them to climb over the tree. There are so many people that they run out of tickets, forcing Benjamin and Kelly to look for more. They end up face to face in a shed, where Kelly admits to Benjamin that she is romantically interested in him and since she ""cant get a handle on it"", she kisses him, telling him that maybe they can do it again on New Years Eve; Benjamin kisses her back, and tells her that he is looking forward to it.Benjamin takes his children to the restaurant where he met their mother, explaining that it was the point where their existence became a possibility.

He has been playing drums from a young age, and he aspires to become a world-class drummer like Buddy Rich. Famed conductor Terence Fletcher invites him into his Studio Band as the alternate for core drummer Carl Tanner. Fletcher is strict, abusive, mocking and insulting towards his students. When the band rehearses the Hank Levy piece ""Whiplash"" and Andrew struggles to keep the tempo, Fletcher hurls a chair at him, slaps him, and berates him in front of the ensemble.At a jazz competition, Carl’s folder is misplaced while Andrew is guarding it. Carl cannot play without it, and Andrew tells Fletcher that he can perform ""Whiplash"" from memory. After a successful performance, Fletcher promotes Andrew to core drummer. Soon after, Fletcher recruits Ryan Connolly, the core drummer from Andrews former lower-level ensemble within the conservatory. Andrew believes Connolly is a less talented drummer than he, and is infuriated when Fletcher promotes Connolly to core. Determined to impress, Andrew practices until his hands bleed, and he breaks up with his girlfriend Nicole to focus on his musical ambitions. After a grueling five-hour audition with Fletcher and the other drummers in the class, in which Fletcher kicks furniture and screams at him, Andrew earns back the core spot.On the way to another competition, the bus Andrew is riding breaks down. He rents a car, but he arrives late, then realizes he left his drumsticks at the rental office. He races back to retrieve them, but after doing so his car is broadsided by a semi. He crawls from the wreckage, runs back to the theater, and arrives on stage bloody and injured. When he struggles to play ""Caravan"", faltering due to his injuries, Fletcher halts the performance and dismisses Andrew. Horrified and enraged at Fletchers extreme lack of compassion, Andrew attacks Fletcher in front of the audience, after which he is dismissed from Shaffer Conservatory.At his fathers request, Andrew meets a lawyer representing the parents of Sean Casey, Fletchers former student, in an ethics complaint against Shaffer Conservatory. Contrary to Fletchers claim that Sean had died in a car accident, the lawyer explains that Sean had committed suicide due to depression that started when he was abused and insulted in school by Fletcher. Seans parents want to see Fletcher dismissed and forbidden from teaching again. Andrew agrees to testify on the condition of anonymity (likely due to fear of some sort of attempted retribution by Fletcher) and Fletcher is fired.Months later, Andrew has abandoned drumming and is working in a restaurant. He discovers Fletcher performing as a pianist in a combo at a jazz club. After the performance, Fletcher invites Andrew for a drink. He explains that he pushed his students so that they might become the next Louis Armstrong or Charlie Parker. Andrew accepts Fletchers invitation to drum with his band at the JVC Jazz Festival. He invites Nicole to the performance, but she has a new relationship.On stage, just before the performance begins, Fletcher reveals that he knows Andrew testified against him, and starts the concert with a piece Andrew does not know.

Eeyore manages to escape from Tigger and hides underwater where he discovers an anchor.After a failed attempt to get honey from a bee hive, Poohs imagination combined with his hunger get the better of him which has ended up eating some mud and later, accidentally falls into the pit meant for the Backson. Rabbit, Kanga, Roo, Owl, Piglet, and Eeyore (using the anchor he found as a replacement tail) try to get him out, but fall in themselves. Piglet, who did not fall in, attempts to get Pooh and friends out of the trap (though continuously irritating Rabbit with over-interpretations of his instructions), but he runs into Tigger, who is still in his Backson outfit, and mistakes him for the actual monster. Piglet escapes from Tigger on a red balloon, which knocks some of the storybooks letters into the pit.After the chase, Tigger and Piglet fall into the trap as well, where Eeyore reminds Tigger that he, being ""the only one,"" is ""the most wonderful thing about Tiggers"". Eventually, Pooh figures out how to use the fallen letters to form a ladder, and his friends are able to escape the pit. They soon find Christopher Robin, and tell him about the Backson, but he clarifies, saying that he meant to be ""back soon"". The honey pot prize is given to the red balloon from earlier, much to Poohs dismay.Later, Pooh visits Owl only to find that Owl is the one that has taken Eeyores tail, not realizing that it belongs to Eeyore. Owl has been using Eeyores tail as a bell-pull for his door. Pooh chooses to leave and return the tail to Eeyore instead of sharing a pot of honey with Owl.

717,718,Woman in Gold,2015,/wiki/Woman_in_Gold_(film),"In a series of flashbacks throughout the film, Maria Altmann recalls the arrival of Nazi forces in Vienna, and the subsequent persecution of the Jewish community and the looting and pillaging conducted by the Nazis against Jewish families. Seeking to escape before the country is completely shut off, Maria Altmann and members of her family attempt to flee to the United States. While Altmann and her husband are successful in their escape, she is forced to abandon her parents in Vienna.In the present, living in Los Angeles, a now elderly and widowed Altmann attends the funeral for her sister. She discovers letters in her sisters possession dating to the late 1940s, which reveal an attempt to recover artwork owned by the Bloch-Bauer family that was left behind during the familys flight for freedom and subsequently stolen by the Nazis. Of particular note is a painting of Altmanns aunt, Adele Bloch-Bauer, now known in Austria as the ""Woman in Gold"".Altmann enlists the help of E. Randol Schoenberg (the son of her close friend, Barbara), a lawyer with little experience, to make a claim to the art restitution board in Austria. Reluctantly returning to her homeland, Altmann discovers that the countrys minister and art director are unwilling to part with the painting, which they feel has become part of the national identity. Altmann is told that the painting was in fact legitimately willed to the gallery by her aunt. Upon further investigation by her lawyer and Austrian journalist Hubertus Czernin, this claim proves to be incorrect, as the alleged will is invalid due to the fact that her aunt did not own the painting in question, the artists fee having been paid by Altmanns uncle; moreover, Adele Bloch-Bauer wanted the painting to go to the museum at her husbands death while in fact it was taken from him by the Nazis and placed in the museum by a Nazi-collaborating curator, well before his death. Schoenberg files a challenge with the art restitution board, but it is denied and Altmann does not have the money needed to challenge the ruling. Defeated, she and Schoenberg return to the United States.Months thereafter, happening upon an art book with ""Woman in Gold"" on the cover, Schoenberg has an epiphany. Using a narrow rule of law and precedents in which an art restitution law was retroactively applied, Schoenberg files a claim in US court against the Austrian government contesting their claim to the painting. An appeal goes to the Supreme Court of the United States, where in the matter of Republic of Austria v. Altmann, the court rules in Altmanns favor, which results in the Austrian government attempting to persuade Altmann to retain the painting for the gallery, which she refuses. After a falling out over the issue of returning to Austria for a second time to argue the case, Altmann agrees for Schoenberg to go and argue the case in front of an arbitration panel of three arbiters in Vienna.In Austria, the arbitration panel hears the case, during which Schoenberg reminds them of the Nazi regimes war crimes. He implores the arbitration panel to think of the meaning of the word ""restitution"" and to look past the artwork hanging in art galleries to see the injustice to the families who once owned such great paintings and were forcibly separated from them by the Nazis. Unexpectedly, Altmann arrives during the session, indicating to Czernin that she came to support her lawyer. After considering both sides of the dispute, the arbitration panel rules in favour of Altmann, returning her paintings. The Austrian government representative makes a last-minute proposal begging Altmann to keep the paintings in the Belvedere against a generous compensation. Altmann refuses and elects to have the painting moved to the United States with her (""They will now travel to America like I once had to as well""), and takes up an offer made earlier by Ronald Lauder to acquire them for his New York gallery to display the painting on condition that it be a permanent exhibit.",11000000,"[{""id"": 18, ""name"": ""Drama""}]",http://womaningoldmovie.com/,304357,"[{""id"": 2652, ""name"": ""nazis""}, {""id"": 9672, ""name"": ""based on true story""}, {""id"": 14893, ""name"": ""art""}, {""id"": 159534, ""name"": ""stolen painting""}]",en,"Maria Altmann, an octogenarian Jewish refugee, takes on the Austrian government to recover a world famous painting of her aunt plundered by the Nazis during World War II, she believes rightfully belongs to her family.

718,719,World War Z,2013,/wiki/World_War_Z_(film),"Former UN employee Gerry Lane, his wife Karin and their two daughters are in heavy Philadelphia traffic when the city is overrun by zombies that are attracted to sound. As chaos spreads, the Lanes escape to Newark, New Jersey and take refuge in an apartment, home to a couple with a young son, Tommy. UN Deputy Secretary-General Thierry Umutoni, an old friend of Gerry, sends a helicopter that extracts the Lanes and Tommy to a U.S. Navy vessel in the Atlantic where scientists and military personnel are analyzing the worldwide outbreaks. Andrew Fassbach posits that the plague is a virus and that development of a vaccine depends on finding the origin. Gerry agrees to help Fassbach find the outbreaks source after it is made clear that the Lanes will be removed from the cramped ship if he is not of use.Gerry and Fassbach fly to Camp Humphreys, a military base in South Korea, where they are attacked on arrival by zombies. Turning to re-enter the aircraft, Fassbach slips, falls and accidentally shoots himself dead. After being rescued by the bases surviving personnel, led by Captain Speke, Gerry learns that the infection was introduced to the base by its doctor, who was ultimately incinerated by a soldier with a lame leg whom the infected ignored. A former CIA operative imprisoned at the base for selling weapons to North Korea (to help them fight the infection) tells Gerry to go to Jerusalem, where he says a safe zone has been maintained by the Israeli Mossad since before the outbreaks official acknowledgement. As Gerry and his team return to their aircraft, Karin—worried about her husband after he misses their pre-arranged call time—rings his satellite phone, attracting zombies who kill several soldiers, with only Gerry and his pilot escaping.In Jerusalem, Gerry meets Mossad chief Jurgen Warmbrunn, who explains that months earlier, the Mossad had intercepted an Indian military message claiming that Indian troops were fighting the rakshasa, or ""dead spirits"". Israel had thereupon quarantined Jerusalem, erecting huge walls around it. Just as Jurgen shows Gerry that Israel is allowing survivors to take refuge in the city, loud celebratory singing from refugees prompts zombies to scale the walls and attack. Jurgen orders some Israeli soldiers to escort Gerry back to his plane. On the way, Gerry notices zombies ignoring an old man and an emaciated boy. Soon after, one of Gerrys escorts, a soldier who identifies herself only as ""Segen"" (lieutenant), is bitten in the hand, which Gerry quickly amputates to stop her turning. Gerry and Segen escape on a commercial airliner as Jerusalem is overrun.Gerry contacts Thierry, and the airliner is diverted to a World Health Organization (WHO) facility outside Cardiff, Wales. When a stowaway zombie attacks on approach to Cardiff airport, Gerry uses a grenade to blow the infected out of the aircraft, which also causes the plane to crash. Gerry is injured, but both he and Segen survive. They proceed to the WHO facility, where Gerry loses consciousness. He awakens three days later and explains to the remaining WHO staff his theory, based on the people he has seen the zombies ignore: the infected do not bite the seriously injured or terminally ill since they would be unsuitable hosts for viral reproduction. He suggests that they test this by deliberately infecting somebody with a pathogen from the facility, but the pathogens are stored in a wing already overrun by zombies. Gerry, Segen and the lead WHO doctor go to get a pathogen. As they fight their way through, they are separated; Gerry continues to the pathogen vault while Segen and the doctor return to the main building. A zombie blocks the door to the vault, prompting him to inject himself with an unknown pathogen and open the vault, thereby testing his theory. The zombie ignores him, as do those he encounters while returning to the main building. Everybody rejoices at Gerrys success.Gerry and his family are reunited in a safe zone at Freeport, Nova Scotia. A ""vaccine"", derived from deadly pathogens, is developed and issued to survivors battling the infected, acting as a kind of camouflage. The vaccine also helps survivors to reach quarantine zones. Human offensives begin against the zombies, and hope is restored. ""This isnt the end,"" Gerry comments, ""Not even close.

719,720,Wrath of the Titans,2012,/wiki/Wrath_of_the_Titans,"Perseus (Sam Worthington), a son of Zeus (Liam Neeson), lives as a fisherman after the death of his wife, Io (portrayed by Gemma Arterton in the previous film), with his young son, Helius (John Bell). Zeus visits Perseus and asks for his help, saying that humans are not praying to the gods and as a result the gods are losing their power and becoming mortal. They can no longer sustain the walls of Tartarus which are crumbling, and the imprisoned Titan Kronos will soon be free. Perseus, valuing his familys safety, refuses to get involved.Zeus meets his brothers Hades (Ralph Fiennes) and Poseidon (Danny Huston), and his son Ares (Édgar Ramírez) in Tartarus. He asks Hadess help in rebuilding Tartaruss walls, but Hades rejects the offer and attacks Zeus. Ares betrays Zeus, imprisoning him and stealing his thunderbolt. Hades and Ares plan to make a deal with Kronos: in exchange for remaining immortal, they will drain Zeuss divine power to revive Kronos. The walls of Tartarus break, unleashing monsters onto the world.After killing a Chimera that attacked his village, Perseus travels to meet his father. He instead finds a dying Poseidon who informs him of the circumstances and tells him to find his Demigod son Agenor (Toby Kebbell) who will lead him to Hephaestus, who knows the way into Tartarus. Poseidon then gives Perseus his trident and succumbs to the injuries he sustained when meeting Hades. Perseus, Andromeda (Rosamund Pike), and Agenor set out to find Hephaestus on a hidden island. Agenor explains that Hephaestus created three weapons which Zeus, Hades, and Poseidon wield: Zeuss thunderbolt, Hadess pitchfork, and Poseidons trident, and that these weapons can jointly form the Spear of Trium, the only weapon that can defeat Kronos. After an encounter with Cyclopes, the travelers eventually meet the now mortal Hephaestus (Bill Nighy) and reach the entrance of a labyrinth leading to Tartarus. Hephaestus sacrifices himself during an attack by Ares to enable Perseus, Andromeda, and Agenor to enter the labyrinth. Once inside the labyrinth they encounter a Minotaur that attacks the group, but Perseus manages to kill it.The group eventually enters Tartarus. Meanwhile, Zeus has been almost entirely drained of power as Kronos awakens. Zeus apologizes to Hades for banishing him to the underworld and asks his forgiveness, as he has forgiven Hades for his actions. Hades decides to help Zeus and stop Kronos in contrast to Ares, who still wants to proceed to the formers revival. Perseus arrives and frees Zeus. Ares wounds Zeus with Hades pitchfork, allowing Perseus to obtain it before he and the others escape Tartarus with Zeus.Aiming to retrieve Zeus thunderbolt from Ares in order to defeat Kronos, Perseus challenges him to a duel. Ares accepts. Meanwhile, Andromedas army is overwhelmed by the Makhai. Hades revives Zeus and together they defeat the creatures. Kronos appears and begins to attack Andromedas army. Zeus and Hades hold off Kronos while Perseus duels Ares eventually killing him with the thunderbolt. Combining the gods weapons into the Spear of Trium, Perseus destroys Kronos, traveling to his heart and throwing the spear into it.Zeus reconciles with Perseus and then dies of his wounds. Hades tells Perseus that now he is powerless and leaves. Perseus kisses Andromeda. Helius tells his father that he wants to return to his life as a fisherman, but Perseus tells him they cant. Perseus encourages Helius to be proud of himself, as his son and the grandson of Zeus.

720,721,Wreck-It Ralph,2012,/wiki/Wreck-It_Ralph,"When Litwaks Family Fun Center & Arcade closes at night, the various video game characters leave their normal in-game roles and socialize in a power strip. Wreck-It Ralph, the antagonist of the game Fix-It Felix Jr., is ostracized by its other characters for being the games villain, while the titular hero Felix is praised and awarded medals. After being excluded from the games thirtieth anniversary party thrown by the inhabitants, Ralph announces that he is tired of being mistreated and will earn his neighbors respect by winning a medal. However, by doing this, he is risking going ""Turbo"" - a term coined when notorious auto-racer Turbo attempted to take over RoadBlasters, a more popular racing game, which resulted in both of their games being unplugged.Ralph learns he can obtain a medal from the first-person shooter, Heros Duty. After disrupting a game session, Ralph scales the games central beacon and obtains a medal, only to hatch a Cy-Bug, a dangerous monster from the game. Ralph and the Cy-Bug stumble into an escape pod, which is launched out of the game, and crash land in Sugar Rush, a candy-themed kart racing game. With Ralph missing, his game is labelled as malfunctioning and faces being unplugged. Felix, upon learning from Q*bert that Ralph has left his game, ventures to Heros Duty and allies with the games heroine, Sergeant Calhoun, to retrieve Ralph and the Cy-Bug.A little girl, Vanellope von Schweetz, steals Ralphs medal to buy her way into the nightly race that determines which characters are playable the next day, but King Candy, the ruler of Sugar Rush, forbids her from racing because she has glitches that cause her to teleport erratically. Ralph and Vanellope agree to work together to retrieve his medal and help her win a race. They build a kart and hide out at Diet Cola Mountain, an unfinished race track, where Ralph teaches her to drive. King Candy hacks the games code to obtain Ralphs medal, and offers it to Ralph in exchange for preventing Vanellope from racing. He claims that if Vanellope wins and becomes playable, her glitches will lead to Sugar Rush being unplugged; unable to leave the game because of her glitch, Vanellope will be left to die while King Candy and his subjects become homeless in the arcade. Ralph reluctantly agrees and destroys Vanellopes kart. Heartbroken, she declares he ""really is a bad guy"" and runs off distraught. Upon returning to his game, which has been evacuated in anticipation of it being unplugged the next morning, Ralph notices Vanellopes image on the side of the Sugar Rush cabinet and realizes she was meant to be a playable character.Meanwhile, Felix and Calhoun search Sugar Rush for Ralph. Felix falls in love with Calhoun, but she abandons him when he inadvertently reminds her of her late fiancé who was murdered by a Cy-Bug on their wedding day. Felix is later imprisoned in King Candys castle, but Ralph frees him and Vanellope, and Felix fixes the kart. Calhoun discovers a swarm of Cy-Bug eggs underground, which hatch and start devouring the game.Vanellope participates in the race, but is attacked by King Candy. Vanellopes glitch reveals he is actually Turbo, who took over Sugar Rush and displaced Vanellope as the main character. Vanellope glitches to escape Turbo, who is then eaten by a Cy-Bug. Ralph, Felix, and Calhoun evacuate the game, but Vanellope is trapped due to her glitches. When Calhoun points out that the Cy-Bugs can be attracted and destroyed by a beacon of light as in Heros Duty, Ralph decides to make Diet Cola Mountain erupt, replicating the beacon. Ralph is confronted by Turbo, now fused with the Cy-Bug that devoured him. Ralph makes the mountain erupt and falls into its depths to sacrifice himself, but Vanellope saves him using her glitching ability. The volcanic beacon lures and permanently destroys the Cy-Bugs and Turbo.Vanellope crosses the finish line, rebooting Sugar Rush and restoring her status and memory as Princess Vanellope, the main character of the game, but keeps her glitching ability.

721,722,X-Men Origins: Wolverine,2011,/wiki/X-Men_Origins:_Wolverine,"In 1845, James Howlett, a boy living in Canada, witnesses his father being killed by groundskeeper Thomas Logan. The anxiety activates the boys mutation: bone claws protrude from his knuckles and he impales Thomas, who reveals that he is James birth father before dying. James flees along with Thomas other son Victor Creed, who is thus James half-brother and has a healing factor mutation like James. They spend the next century as soldiers, fighting in the American Civil War, both World Wars and the Vietnam War. In Vietnam, the increasingly violent Victor attempts to rape a Vietnamese woman and kills a senior officer who tries to stop him. James happens upon the fight and defends Victor, resulting in the pair being sentenced to execution by firing squad, which they survive due to their mutant healing abilities. Major William Stryker approaches them in military custody and offers them membership in Team X, a group of mutants including Agent Zero, Wade Wilson, John Wraith, Fred Dukes and Chris Bradley. They join the team for a few years, with James now using the alias Logan, but Victor and the groups lack of empathy for human life causes Logan to leave.Six years later, Logan is working as a logger in Canada, where he lives with his girlfriend Kayla Silverfox. Stryker and Zero approach Logan at work. Stryker reports that Wade and Bradley have been killed and he thinks someone is targeting the teams members. Logan refuses to rejoin Stryker but after finding Kaylas bloodied body in the woods, he realizes that Victor is responsible. He finds him at a local bar, but Logan loses the subsequent fight. Afterward, Stryker explains that Victor has gone rogue and offers Logan a way to become strong enough to get his revenge. Logan undergoes a painful operation to reinforce his skeleton with adamantium, a virtually indestructible metal. Once the procedure is complete, Stryker attempts to betray Logan by ordering that his memory be erased so he can be used as Strykers personal weapon, but Logan overhears this and escapes to a nearby farm, where an elderly couple take him in. Zero kills them the following morning and tries to kill Logan, but Logan takes down Zeros helicopter and swears to kill both Stryker and Victor.Logan locates John and Fred at a boxing club. Fred explains that Victor is still working for Stryker, hunting down mutants for Stryker to experiment on at his new laboratory, located at a place called ""The Island"". Fred mentions Remy ""Gambit"" LeBeau, the only one who escaped from the island and therefore knows its location. John and Logan find LeBeau in New Orleans, then both fight Victor, who kills John and extracts his DNA. Agreeing to help release mutants that Stryker has captured, Gambit takes Logan to Strykers facility on Three Mile Island. Logan learns that Kayla is alive, having been forced by Stryker into surveilling him in exchange for her sisters safety. However, Stryker refuses to release her sister and denies Victor the adamantium bonding promised for his service, claiming that test results revealed Victor would not survive the operation. Stryker activates Wade, now known as Weapon XI, a ""mutant killer"" with the powers of multiple mutants.While Logan and Victor join forces to fight off Weapon XI, Kayla is mortally wounded leading the captive mutants to Professor Charles Xavier and safety. After Logan kills Weapon XI, Stryker arrives and shoots Logan in the head with adamantium bullets, rendering Logan unconscious. Before Stryker can shoot Kayla, she grabs him and uses her mutant power to persuade him to turn around and walk away until his feet bleed. Logan regains consciousness but has lost his memory. He notices his dog tags read ""Logan"" on one side and ""Wolverine"" on the other.

723,724,X-Men: Days of Future Past,2014,/wiki/X-Men:_Days_of_Future_Past,"In a year 2023 at a dystopian future, Sentinels have been programmed to identify and hunt down mutants and any humans who dared to help them. A small band of mutants were attacked and Kitty Pryde sends Bishops consciousness back in time a few days before the attack, in an effort to warn the other mutants so as to ensure their survival.Professor Charles Xavier and other mutant survivors later meet Kitty Pryde at a remote Chinese temple, and explains the history of the Sentinels, which were designed by Bolivar Trask, whom Mystique assassinated in 1973. Feared by Trasks death, the government forces immediately captured Mystique and experimented on by scientists who used her DNA to advance their Sentinel program explaining how they are able to adapt to nearly every mutant power. Because of Kittys time traveling ability, Xavier and Magneto plans to prevent Trasks assassination but since Xavier cannot survive going back decades, Wolverine volunteers instead since his regenerative powers would allow him to survive the process.After awakening in his younger body in 1973, Wolverine arrives at the X-Mansion, discovering the school has been shut down for years due to many of the students and staffs being drafted to the Vietnam War. A young, broken Xavier turned into alcoholism and has shunned his mutant powers by using a specialized serum that suppresses his telepathic abilities in order to walk. Hoping to reunite with Mystique, Xavier agrees to help Wolverine and busts Erik Lensherr , who got incarcerated in 1963 after John F. Kennedy got assassinated due to him, (he maintains his innocence later on) out of his prison cell under the Pentagon, aided by Hank McCoy and Peter Maximoff.Mystique discovers Trask has been experimenting on mutants and in revenge plots to assassinate him at the Paris Peace Accords. Her vengeance results in failure after Xavier, Hank, and Wolverine intervene, and Erik attempts to kill her to prevent the Sentinel takeover from happening. A fight ensures between Hank and Erik which allows Mystique to escape but the three expose themselves as mutants to the world. Trask takes advantage of this event and successfully convinces President Richard Nixon to initialize the Sentinel program.Erik obtains his signature helmet back from the Pentagon to block out Xaviers psychic powers and secretly takes control of Trasks Sentinel prototypes. Returning to the X-Mansion, Xavier ultimately abandons the serum, regaining his mutant power, and communicates with his future self, who inspires him to protect the relationship between mutants and mankind. After using Cerebro to track Mystique, he, Hank and Wolverine take flight to Washington, D.C. to put an end to her assassination plot on Trask.At a ceremony where Nixon unveils the Sentinels, Xavier, Hank, and Wolverine search for the disguised Mystique. Erik appears, controlling the Sentinels, and uses the Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium to surround the White House. Hank transforms into Beast and fights a Sentinel. Wolverine confronts Erik, but is thrown into the Potomac River. Nixon, Trask, and Mystique hide in a safe room beneath the White House, but Erik rips it out of the building with the intention of killing the U.S. President.In the future, the Sentinels managed to find the X-Men and launch an attack on them; one by one perished while attempting to buy more time. Meanwhile back in 1973, Xavier persuades Mystique to spare Trask after she saves President Nixon from Erik, altering history and erasing the Sentinels from existence. Erik and Mystique both leave, one a criminal, the other a hero; and Trask is jailed for attempting to sell U.S. military secrets to Vietnamese officials.Wolverine wakes up at the mansion in 2023 to find Iceman, Rogue, Colossus, Kitty, Beast, Storm, Jean Grey, Scott Summers and Xavier all alive. Wolverine speaks to Xavier, who is also aware of the changes in history. Back in 1973, the younger Wolverine is rescued by Mystique, who is disguised as William Stryker.In a post-credits scene, set in Ancient Egypt, an Egyptian crowd is seen chanting to En Sabah Nur, who telekinetically elevates building blocks to forge pyramids as four horsemen observe him from afar.",250000000,"[{""id"": 28, ""name"": ""Action""}, {""id"": 12, ""name"": ""Adventure""}, {""id"": 14, ""name"": ""Fantasy""}, {""id"": 878, ""name"": ""Science Fiction""}]",http://www.x-menmovies.com/,127585,"[{""id"": 1228, ""name"": ""1970s""}, {""id"": 1852, ""name"": ""mutant""}, {""id"": 4379, ""name"": ""time travel""}, {""id"": 8828, ""name"": ""marvel comic""}, {""id"": 9717, ""name"": ""based on comic book""}, {""id"": 10761, ""name"": ""superhuman""}, {""id"": 14527, ""name"": ""storm""}, {""id"": 161271, ""name"": ""beast""}, {""id"": 179430, ""name"": ""aftercreditsstinger""}, {""id"": 206736, ""name"": ""changing the past or future""}]",en,The ultimate X-Men ensemble fights a war for the survival of the species across two time periods as they join forces with their younger selves in an epic battle that must change the past – to save our future.,118.078691,"[{""name"": ""Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation"", ""id"": 306}, {""name"": ""Donners' Company"", ""id"": 431}, {""name"": ""Marvel Entertainment"", ""id"": 7505}, {""name"": ""Bad Hat Harry Productions"", ""id"": 9168}, {""name"": ""TSG Entertainment"", ""id"": 22213}, {""name"": ""Down Productions"", ""id"": 37336}, {""name"": ""Revolution Sun Studios"", ""id"": 76043}]","[{""iso_3166_1"": ""GB"", ""name"": ""United Kingdom""}, {""iso_3166_1"": ""US"", ""name"": ""United States of America""}]",5/15/2014,747862775,131,"[{""iso_639_1"": ""en"", ""name"": ""English""}]",Released,"To save the future, they must alter the past",X-Men: Days of Future Past,7.5,6032,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0,0,0,0,2.9914511

In his office, Schmidt orders Lehnsherr to move a coin on his desk, and kills the boys mother when Lehnsherr fails to do so. In grief and rage, Lehnsherrs magnetic power manifests, killing two guards and destroying the room. Meanwhile, at a mansion in Westchester County, New York, child telepath Charles Xavier meets young shapeshifter Raven, whose natural form is blue-skinned and scaly. Overjoyed to meet someone ""different"", like himself, he invites her to live with his family as his foster sister.In 1962, Lehnsherr is tracking down Schmidt, while Xavier graduates from the University of Oxford. In Las Vegas, CIA officer Moira MacTaggert follows U.S. Army Colonel Hendry into the Hellfire Club, where she sees Schmidt—now known as Sebastian Shaw—with mutant telepath Emma Frost, cyclone-producing Riptide, and teleporter Azazel. Threatened by Shaw and teleported by Azazel to the Joint War Room, Hendry advocates deployment of nuclear missiles in Turkey. Shaw, an energy-absorbing mutant whose powers have de-aged him, later kills Hendry.MacTaggert, seeking Xaviers advice on mutation, takes him and Raven to the CIA, where they convince Director McCone that mutants exist and Shaw is a threat. Another CIA officer sponsors the mutants and invites them to the secret ""Division X"" facility. MacTaggert and Xavier find Shaw as Lehnsherr is attacking him on his yacht, and rescue Lehnsherr from drowning, while Shaw escapes in a submarine. Xavier brings Lehnsherr to Division X, where they meet young scientist Hank McCoy, a mutant with prehensile feet, who believes Ravens DNA may provide a ""cure"" for their appearance. Xavier uses McCoys mutant-locating device Cerebro to seek recruits against Shaw. Xavier and Lehnsherr recruit stripper Angel Salvadore, cabbie Armando Muñoz, Army prisoner Alex Summers, and runaway Sean Cassidy.When Frost meets with a Soviet general in the USSR, and uses her telepathic powers to pretend to have sex with him, Xavier and Lehnsherr capture Frost and discover that Shaw intends to start World War III that will trigger mutant ascendancy and the extinction of the human race. Azazel, Riptide and Shaw attack Division X, killing everyone but the mutants, whom Shaw invites to join him. Salvadore accepts; and when Summers and Muñoz retaliate, Shaw kills Muñoz. In Moscow, Shaw compels the general to have the USSR install missiles in Cuba. Wearing a helmet that blocks telepathy, Shaw follows the Soviet fleet in a submarine to ensure the missiles break a US blockade.Raven, thinking McCoy is attracted to her in her natural form, tells him not to use the cure. When she later attempts to seduce Lehnsherr by taking the forms of various women, Lehnsherr tells her she is beautiful as she is, in her natural mutant form. McCoy uses the cure on himself but it backfires, giving him blue fur and leonine aspects. With McCoy piloting, the mutants and MacTaggert take a jet to the blockade line, where Xavier uses his telepathy to influence a Soviet sailor to destroy the ship carrying the missiles, and Lehnsherr uses his magnetic power to lift Shaws submarine from the water and deposit it on land. During the ensuing battle, Lehnsherr seizes Shaws helmet, allowing Xavier to immobilize Shaw. Lehnsherr tells Shaw he shares Shaws exclusivist view of mutants but, to avenge his mother, kills Shaw—over Xaviers objections—by forcing the Nazi coin from his childhood through Shaws brain, causing massive pain to Xavier in the process.Fearing the mutants, both fleets fire missiles at them, which Lehnsherr turns back in mid-flight. MacTaggert tries to stop Lehnsherr by shooting him but he deflects the bullets, one of which hits Xavier in the spine.

With McCoy piloting, the mutants and MacTaggert take a jet to the blockade line, where Xavier uses his telepathy to influence a Soviet sailor to destroy the ship carrying the missiles, and Lehnsherr uses his magnetic power to lift Shaws submarine from the water and deposit it on land. During the ensuing battle, Lehnsherr seizes Shaws helmet, allowing Xavier to immobilize Shaw. Lehnsherr tells Shaw he shares Shaws exclusivist view of mutants but, to avenge his mother, kills Shaw—over Xaviers objections—by forcing the Nazi coin from his childhood through Shaws brain, causing massive pain to Xavier in the process.Fearing the mutants, both fleets fire missiles at them, which Lehnsherr turns back in mid-flight. MacTaggert tries to stop Lehnsherr by shooting him but he deflects the bullets, one of which hits Xavier in the spine. Lehnsherr rushes to help Xavier and, distracted, allows the missiles to fall harmlessly into the ocean. Parting with Xavier over their differing views on the relationship between mutants and humans, Lehnsherr leaves with Salvadore, Azazel, Riptide and Mystique. Later, a wheelchair-bound Xavier and his mutants are at the mansion, where he intends to open a school. MacTaggert promises never to reveal his location and they kiss. When they kiss, Xavier uses his powers and erases their memories from her mind. Elsewhere, Lehnsherr, now wearing Shaws helmet, frees Frost from confinement and he then goes by the name : “Magneto”.",160000000,"[{""id"": 28, ""name"": ""Action""}, {""id"": 878, ""name"": ""Science Fiction""}, {""id"": 12, ""name"": ""Adventure""}]",http://www.x-menfirstclassmovie.com/,49538,"[{""id"": 591, ""name"": ""cia""}, {""id"": 1852, ""name"": ""mutant""}, {""id"": 1960, ""name"": ""mine""}, {""id"": 8828, ""name"": ""marvel comic""}, {""id"": 9715, ""name"": ""superhero""}, {""id"": 9717, ""name"": ""based on comic book""}, {""id"": 10761, ""name"": ""superhuman""}, {""id"": 12995, ""name"": ""historical fiction""}, {""id"": 18139, ""name"": ""nuclear war""}, {""id"": 181558, ""name"": ""cuban missile crisis""}, {""id"": 208731, ""name"": ""world war iii""}, {""id"": 208992, ""name"": ""1960s""}]",en,"Before Charles Xavier and Erik Lensherr took the names Professor X and Magneto, they were two young men discovering their powers for the first time.

728,729,Young Adult,2011,/wiki/Young_Adult_(film),"Mavis Gary (Charlize Theron) is a divorced, alcoholic 37-year-old ghost writer of a series of young adult novels, who is on deadline with her editor to finish the last book of the soon-to-be-cancelled series. Mavis receives an e-mail with a picture of the newborn daughter of her high school boyfriend Buddy Slade (Patrick Wilson) and his wife Beth (Elizabeth Reaser). Believing this to be a sign she and Buddy are meant to be together, Mavis leaves Minneapolis and returns to her hometown of Mercury, Minnesota, to reclaim her life with Buddy, under the pretext of overseeing a real estate deal.Upon arriving after listening to ""The Concept"" by Teenage Fanclub on repeat from an old mixtape Buddy gave her in high school, Mavis arranges to meet him the next day at a local sports bar, for old times sake. In the interim, she goes alone to a different bar, Woodys. There she reconnects with a former classmate she barely remembers, Matt Freehauf (Patton Oswalt), who became disabled after being beaten by jocks who erroneously assumed he was gay. Matt tells Mavis that her plan to destroy Buddys marriage is irrational and selfish, but she ignores him.The following day, Mavis meets Buddy at the sports bar, where they run into Matt, the bars bookkeeper. On their way out, Buddy invites Mavis to a performance of Beths ""mom rock band"". In the interim, Mavis spends another night getting drunk with Matt, who distills homemade bourbon in the garage of the house he shares with his sister Sandra. When Mavis attends the concert of Beths band, the other moms are resentful of Mavis, whom they remember as the ""psychotic prom queen bitch"". When Beths band performs, the lead singer dedicates their opening song to Buddy from Beth; much to Maviss dismay, it is ""The Concept"".Beth wants to stay out longer, so Mavis offers to drive the drunk Buddy home. On the lawn they share a kiss that is quickly broken up when the babysitter opens the front door to greet them. The next day, after an awkward encounter with her parents, Mavis is invited to Buddys daughters naming ceremony. She later goes out drinking with Matt again, during which Matt tells Mavis to grow up. The following day, Mavis attends the party, where she declares her love for Buddy, but he rebuffs her. Everyone at the party is called out to the lawn to await a surprise Buddy has prepared for Beth. Mavis, who has been drinking at the party, collides with Beth, who accidentally spills punch on Maviss dress. Mavis insults her, and in a profanity-laced tirade tearfully reveals she became pregnant with Buddys baby years ago, but had a miscarriage after three months.Buddy, who has been preparing a drum-set gift for Beth in the garage, opens the garage door and belatedly learns what has transpired. Mavis asks him why he invited her. He reveals it was Beths idea, as she feels sorry for Mavis. Humiliated, Mavis leaves the party and visits Matt, where she breaks down in tears and, later, initiates sex. The following morning, while Matt sleeps, Mavis has coffee in the kitchen with Sandra, who still idolizes her. Mavis talks about needing to change herself, but Sandra says Mavis is better than the rest of Mercury and should not change. Mavis says she agrees, and prepares to return to Minneapolis. Sandra asks to go with her but Mavis declines and leaves alone.In a diner on her way home, Mavis writes the last chapter of the book, in which the main character graduates high school, quickly leaves her past behind and looks forward to the future.

They are warriors: Fabious is dashing and skilled and Thadeous is lazy and ineffectual. While celebrating his latest victory over the evil sorcerer, Leezar, who has been ravaging Talliouss kingdom, Fabious introduces the virgin Belladonna whom he has freed from a tower and wishes to marry. Though his brother makes him the best man, Thadeous skips the wedding after overhearing Fabious Knights Elite, led by Boremont, talk about him negatively. The wedding is then crashed by Leezar, who reveals himself to be the one who placed Belladonna in the tower. Leezar re-kidnaps her and flees. Returning to the castle with his servant Courtney, Thadeous is given an ultimatum: join Fabious on his quest to rescue Belladonna or be banished from Mourne.Visiting the Great Wize Wizard, Thadeous and Fabious learn that Leezar is attempting to fulfill a prophecy of a warlock having sex with a maiden when the two moons converge, impregnating her with a dragon that will allow him to take over King Tallious kingdom. To destroy Leezar, they are given a magic compass that will lead them to the Blade of Unicorn, located within a labyrinth. On the way there, they learn Fabiouss eunuch slave, Julie, has been reporting to Leezar of their progress and that the Knights Elite are serving the warlock. Fabious sends his mechanical bird Simon to tell the king of the betrayal by the Knights Elite and request reinforcements.

The next day, the party learns too late that Isabel stole the compass from Thadeous. Fabious, finally angered by his brothers selfishness, decides to find the Blade of Unicorn alone as Thadeous and Courtney go to a tavern, where they find Isabel and retrieve the compass. But finding that his brother has been captured by Leezars men, Thadeous wins Isabel over as they join forces, entering the labyrinth where they encounter a Minotaur. After becoming separated from the others, Thadeous retrieves the Blade of Unicorn and slays the Minotaur.

Despite Sheenis boyfriend, Trent Preston, they become romantically involved.

731,732,Zero Dark Thirty,2012,/wiki/Zero_Dark_Thirty,"Maya is a U.S. Central Intelligence Agency analyst tasked with finding the al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. In 2003 she is stationed at the U.S. embassy in Pakistan. She and officer Dan attend the black site interrogations of Ammar, a detainee with suspected links to several of the 2001 hijackers in the September 11 attacks who is subjected to approved torture interrogation techniques. Ammar provides unreliable information on a suspected attack in Saudi Arabia, but reveals to Maya the name of the personal courier for bin Laden, Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti. Other detainee intelligence connects courier traffic by Abu Ahmed between Abu Faraj al-Libbi (Yoav Levi) and bin Laden. In 2005, Faraj denies knowing about a courier named Abu Ahmed; Maya interprets this as an attempt by Faraj to conceal the importance of Abu Ahmed.In 2009, during the Camp Chapman attack, Mayas fellow officer and friend Jessica (Jennifer Ehle) is killed. A case manager that likes the Abu Ahmed lead shares with her an interrogation with a Jordanian detainee claiming to have buried Abu Ahmed in 2001. Maya learns what the CIA was told five years earlier: that Morocco caught Ibrihim Sayeed traveling under the name of Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti. Realizing her lead may be alive, Maya contacts Dan, now a senior officer at the CIA headquarters. She speculates that the CIAs photograph of Ahmed is that of his brother, Habeeb, who was killed in Afghanistan. Maya says that their beards and native clothes make the brothers look alike, explaining Ammars account of Ahmeds ""death"" in 2001.A Kuwaiti prince trades the phone number of Sayeeds mother for a Lamborghini. CIA operatives use electronic methods to pinpoint a caller in a vehicle who exhibits tradecraft behaviors that delay confirmation of his identity. They track the vehicle to a large urban compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, near the Pakistan Military Academy. After gunmen attack Maya while she is in her vehicle, she is recalled to Washington, D.C.The CIA puts the compound under surveillance, but obtains no conclusive identification of bin Laden. The Presidents National Security Advisor tasks the CIA with creating a plan to capture or kill bin Laden. Before briefing President Barack Obama, the CIA Director (James Gandolfini) holds a meeting of his senior officers, who assess that bin Laden being there is a chance of 60–80%, rather than another high-value target. Maya, also in attendance, uses the ""habits"" intelligence to shore-up her conclusion to 100% that bin Laden is there.On May 2, 2011, the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment flies two stealth helicopters from Area 51 into Pakistan and inserts members of DEVGRU and the CIAs SAD/SOG to raid the compound. One helicopter crashes, but the SEALs gain entry and kill a number of people within the compound, including a man they believe is bin Laden.

732,733,Zookeeper,2011,/wiki/Zookeeper_(film),"A zookeeper named Griffin Keyes (Kevin James) sets up a plan to propose to the love of his life Stephanie (Leslie Bibb), but she rejects him and claims that his career as a zookeeper is what is keeping her away, therefore breaking Griffins heart.Five years later, Griffin is shown to be the lead zookeeper at the Franklin Park Zoo who cares deeply for the zoo animals. That night, Griffin holds a party at the zoo for his brother Dave (Nat Faxon) who is getting married, but freaks out when he discovers that Stephanie was invited. Dave offers Griffin to come and work with him at a car dealership, explaining that it is the best way to get Stephanie back. Griffin contemplates quitting his job at the zoo and joining his brother at the dealership.Later, the animals hold a meeting saying that they think Griffin is the best zookeeper at the zoo and dont want him to leave, so they decide to find some way to help him win Stephanies heart. Jerome the Bear (Jon Favreau) suggests that they teach Griffin their animal mating techniques, but Joe the Lion (Sylvester Stallone) protests, reminding them that its against the animal code to talk to humans. Donald the Monkey (Adam Sandler) says that Stephanie will be at the zoo tomorrow, and all the animals have to do is make Griffin look like a hero in front of her.The next day, Donald unlocks the door to the lion enclosure and lets Joe out, who confronts Stephanie and Daves fiancée Robin (Steffiana de la Cruz). Kate (Rosario Dawson), the zoos vet, manages to get them away from Joe, but Griffin fails to jump into the lion enclosure, ruining the animals plan. When he climbs out of the enclosure, Joe yells at Griffin, causing Griffin to believe he has gone mad. The next night, all the animals break their code of silence and tell Griffin that they will teach him what to do to win Stephanie. Griffin learns their different mating rituals, but ends up humiliating himself in front of the other zookeepers and the guests.Griffin then has a talk with Bernie (Nick Nolte), a forlorn gorilla who was moved into a deep enclosure after allegedly attacking a zookeeper named Shane (Donnie Wahlberg). Bernie explains to Griffin that Shane abuses the animals and he fell when he was abusing Bernie. He lied and said that Bernie attacked him, causing Bernie to lose his trust in humans.Griffin discovers that Stephanie is dating her other ex-boyfriend, a bullying alpha-male named Gale (Joe Rogan). Joes mate Janet (Cher) tells Griffin that the best way to attract a female is to be seen with another female, so Griffin asks Kate to go with him to Dave and Robins wedding. Griffin then takes Bernie to T.G.I. Fridays and they bond, with Bernie telling Griffin that hes his best friend.Griffin and Kate go to the wedding and seem to have fun together. Griffin becomes brave enough to stand up to Gale and this grabs Stephanies attention. After Kate tells Griffin she had a great time with him, Stephanie asks Griffin out to dinner. Griffin accepts and they go to dinner and then go to a fashion show. Stephanie tells Griffin that his job at the zoo is holding him back, so Griffin decides to quit his job and accepts Daves offer, which upsets Kate. Bernie also becomes upset and tells Griffin that he thought he could trust someone again, but was proved wrong when Griffin quit his job. Kate decides to leave the zoo and accepts a job in Nairobi.Griffin becomes the best employee at the car dealership, but misses working at the zoo. Stephanie proposes to Griffin, but Griffin refuses and dumps her after coming to the realization that if Stephanie did love him she would accept him for who he was and not what he was. He then goes back to the zoo and apologizes to Bernie, who accepts Griffins friendship. The animals then tell Griffin that Kate is heading to the airport. Griffin heads out to stop her, though he does make a stop first to beat up Shane. Then, with Bernies help, Griffin manages to catch up with Kate on the bridge and confesses his love for her. Six months later, Griffin and Kate are back working at the zoo and Bernie is now living in a new enclosure where he gets a great view of the city. When Bernie asks what a ""Benihana"" is, Griffin asks Bernie if he still has his Izod.",80000000,"[{""id"": 35, ""name"": ""Comedy""}, {""id"": 10749, ""name"": ""Romance""}, {""id"": 10751, ""name"": ""Family""}]",http://www.zookeeper-movie.com/,38317,"[{""id"": 11477, ""name"": ""talking animal""}, {""id"": 14760, ""name"": ""scientist""}, {""id"": 15147, ""name"": ""german accent""}, {""id"": 15148, ""name"": ""ostrich""}, {""id"": 15149, ""name"": ""monkey""}, {""id"": 15150, ""name"": ""bullfrog""}, {""id"": 15151, ""name"": ""car dealership""}, {""id"": 179431, ""name"": ""duringcreditsstinger""}]",en,"A comedy about a zookeeper who might be great with animals, but he doesn't know anything about the birds and the bees.

Billy Zane visits and gives him an invitation to the House of Atoz fashion show by the ""Queen of Haute Couture"", Alexanya Atoz, and persuades him to return to a regular lifestyle in order to regain custody of his son. In the ""uncharted Malibu territories"", Hansel returns to his home after dinner and is informed by his orgy that they are all pregnant and that he is the father. He is later given the same invitation by Zane.At the fashion show, Derek and Hansel are surprised to find that the ever-changing fashion world is now dominated by the likes of Don Atari and the non-binary All. They are put on the runway in ""Old"" and ""Lame"" outfits and are doused by a large bucket of prunes. Afterwards, Alexanya congratulates them on their performance.After reuniting, Derek and Hansel are tracked down by Valentina, who asks them to help Interpol uncover who is behind the systematic assassinations. With Valentinas help, Derek discovers his son is residing at a local orphanage. They find him, but Derek is distraught by his sons obesity. After Matildas ghost asks him to protect their son, Hansel convinces Derek to accept Derek Jr.  After meeting the Headmaster, Derek takes his son around Rome. However, Derek Jr. becomes disgruntled with his father and returns to the orphanage. Hansel receives an anonymous call, requesting that he travel to St. Peters Basilica at midnight. He, Derek, and Valentina go to the church and meet with Sting, who tells them the tale of Adam and Eve and the little-known Steve, a secret that many popstars have died to protect. It is said that Steve is the common ancestor of all models and that he and his closest descendant (Derek Jr) holds the bloodline of the Fountain of Youth. Derek returns to the orphanage, only to find it in disrepair and his son and the Headmaster gone.

Mugatu and many of the worlds fashion designers prepare to cut out Derek Jr.s heart and consume his blood, believing it to grant them eternal youth as it contains the blood of Steve. Derek, Hansel, and Valentina stop Mugatu from proceeding and he reveals that he brought together the worlds fashion designers to kill them as revenge for leaving him imprisoned.
